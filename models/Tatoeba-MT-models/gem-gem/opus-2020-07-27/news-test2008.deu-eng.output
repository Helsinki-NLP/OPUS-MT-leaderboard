Food debts of European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the Eurozone is the rapid increase in food prices.
In the 13 countries of the Eurozone, the value was higher than expected in November, after 2.6% in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1% was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts were estimated from only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
Unlike the American, British, and Canadian Notenbank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the Guidelines; according to your assessment, the reduction in interest rates would benefit from the increase in raw materials prices and the slight reduction in unemployment.
The ECB seeks to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two-percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is located in the twisted mill: Inflation must be "agreed" in order to exclude later action needs.
With 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in November reached a 12-year record high in Germany; in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The rise in food and energy prices is responsible for the increase in inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF wheat notations increased by 88 percent, and the course for soya beans has also reached a record high since 1973.
In 2007, food oil and dairy products were also expensive.
The world market price for raw oil increased by 52 percent this year - last month the price per piece of black gold reached nearly $100.
According to the ECB, the inflation will increase from 2.1 per cent in 2008 to 2.5 per cent, but it is expected to decrease to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months analyzers are expected to have a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce interest twice.
Gallup Local Government Crisis
After long staggering, the number of Fidesz sympathisers has grown significantly until the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while the agreement for socialists has reached a depth of 13 percent, according to Gallup.
The difference in partial electorates is clear thanks to the high determination of opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 percent) represent a fifth (20 percent) consent to the MCP.
MDF and SZDSZ are, according to the survey, below the parliamentary commission: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of partial choosers has grown by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last depth, the general economic atmosphere has continued to deteriorate - never before, the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation as "extremely bad" was so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent believed it was "fertilely bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, the families see the change of their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects a further deterioration of the situation; only one tenth is due to improvement.
A Gallup survey carried out in December revealed that 71% of the respondents - a historic high - considered the premier's work as "predominantly bad as right".
Thirteen percent of the respondents have large confidence or trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of Viktor Orbán's advocates represents 38 percent.
Approximately 54% do not trust the Head of Government at all, compared with 27% distrust against the Head of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political atmosphere is the number of people who believe that you could deal with dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without change of government.
If, after the disturbances last October, 35% had been expressed for the remainance of the government and the Head of Government, this share is still only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) only sees the solution in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "with security", and another 20% would "probably" give their vote.
In comparison, if Parliament's elections were to take place this Sunday, only 55% would go "with security" to the urns, and another 15% believes that their participation would be "likely".
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital daily money.
Based on the group of participants in the "protected" referral, the proportions of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, or 89 percent.
Also the most expensive, Tesco increased by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area also maintained this year the average price increase of 16% from the last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörs Trade Triangle, the price of the ordinary Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets, price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been recorded.
Since the prices in food markets were "davongaloped" last December, the cost was not significantly depreciated, compared to the yet high, previous baseline level.
However, it is definitely disturbing for consumers that what they paid much less than 9000 HUF last year is not even available for 10.000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" basket exceeded the magical 10.000 HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and live fish remained nearly at previous years, while the prices for puncture, nuts and mouths have increased strongly.
Prices for flour and bread matched the data of Hungary's Central Statistical Office, but also there were 1 kg breadweaking for 139 Forint.
There was no competition-related price disturbance in the product at below 200 Forint.
In addition, the price of a two-litre Coca-Cola pfand bottle of less than 200 forint was surprising, so the drink included pfand only 257 HUF.
Yet this year in the "Napi" basket comparison also cut the most expensive, and Cora the most affordable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" cart compared to the Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Alsoan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest cart of the last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was 1,206,00 Forint in the previous year, but the VAT increase was noticeable at the last Christmas prices.
This process has made trade arg: it seems that the houses of goods were not able to determine the price margin they were to apply for each article, as the effects of price increases on consumer behaviour were indispensable.
(If the dealer plans the circulation speed of a product poorly, he can fall to significant profits in the price margin that is determined by the transport intensity.)
Mehwertsteuer-conditioned the value of the "Napi" basket was so radical in the past year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, while the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost more than the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1,284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic increase in prices, the price of daily consumption items in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, on the other hand, does not necessarily confirm the data of Hungary's Central Statistical Office: In some basic nutrients, the Statistical Office established a cost of more than 30% over the 12 months period.
For example, in some beside meal also in eggs.)
However, if you throw a look into the "Napi" cart, this seems almost impossible for the latter, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year even in the worst case has increased by little more than 10 percent.
It is evident that mill suppliers are in a stronger position than the elephants - they were able to defeat the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the Golden Trade Triangle, the hypermarkets are not complaining; good years are reported.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses no longer look at the prices.
It is purchased from large quantities, sustainable foods are going over the shop tables in palettes.
On Wednesday morning morning, there were endless hoses at the Kassa when the number of customers suddenly exploded.
However, a smaller frequency of customers is reported by the country, so that many multipliers complain about opinion researchers that they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only in food, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
Many rods are stored in disinfectants
More than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to inaccurate dealing with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the overload of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not just tolerable to the determination of infections, according to the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many reds are also saved in the disinfectants.
A MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed in the traumatic department of the János Hospital.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was transmitted to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection here.
The injured person of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, but a few later the man had to return with an MRSA infection. An important surgery has not been performed since the bacterium, which is still in the patient's body.
Until December 10, this year, hospitals of 1094 were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System by multiresistant agents, the head of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So so many infections caused by multiresistant agents have been registered in hospitals with certainty, but the dark numbers are likely to be higher.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacterium wears about one third of the people in their nose without it would cause a disease.
SA-related infections (such as halse inflammation, male inflammation, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well-healable.
However, if the means are excessively dosed or inappropriate, then antibiotic resistance from the well responding bacteria, which are rapidly spreading in hospitals under appropriate conditions.
In particular, these bacteria may cause severe infections, such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis, in patients with low body weight.
According to the doctor’s head of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such events belong to the hospital everyday.
If the infection may not be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is only not there where it is not searched.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Some patients are isolated, the care professional wears rubber gloves and masks in supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment" says Tibor Nyulasi.
While the patients are investigated at MRSA, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Sample withdrawals too rare
The majority of infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the current dominant conditions and circumstances are unfavourable to prevent the emergence or spread of the multiresistant agent, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and older homes, the hospitals should examine the patients submitted and immediately isolate MRSA infected.
However, in the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sampling is not so frequently practiced.
Not least because there are no grants for this investigation on the side of the State Hospital.
Therefore, most cases would only come to daylight if the patient already has a remarkable MRSA infection, according to the doctor’s head of the Epidemiology Centre.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the proper application of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also directives for the treatment of certain infections and disease models in Hungary.
Antibiotics should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary in order not to be resistant to the medicine, but these directives of hospitals are not always complied with.
Ambulant or basic patients have even more rare microbiological samples, according to Karolina Böröcz.
The disinfectants are spared
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is transferred from one patient to another most frequently by career.
It is therefore very important to wash hands or to wear gloves and masks, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by drip infection or contact, but in the home hospitals there is not always the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even frequently filled, the beds are close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters from epidemiological point of view.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, it is unfortunately in the financially less well-established hospitals even that disinfectants are spared, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that just support the emergence of infections.
Such infections are demonstrated to be much less frequent there, or the further spread of the inducer can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
To get MRSA infections in handle causes the health insurance enormous costs, so they are fighted everywhere.
For example, in England, the prevention of MRSA, or its imminence, was held in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data prove, the trend of MRSA infections in England is declined.
The European Center for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the emergence of multiresistant organisms (including MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals, one of its priorities.
The death link politics were not drunk
In the case of car accidents caused by the head of the XXII district with a fatal exit, the official opinion is now available.
The police chief of the XXII district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday on a car accident, was not alcoholized, nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press speaker of the Supreme Court of Budapest on Friday after the official advice was submitted to the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he was taxed.
The former police chief booked with his own truck in XXII. District into the Cossuth Lajos street and traveled over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road at an unsigned place.
(On the other hand, according to StVO, this is not a milder condition - the linker has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the Zebra strip, succession .)
The pedestrian is injured after his introduction to the hospital.
According to police reports, the linker suffered a shock, then put his functions back and requested retirement.
Budapest's prosecutor has launched its investigations for an incident.
Atila Morvai also mentioned that the former police officer had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Other EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three loan agreements in Budapest in total of EUR 400 million. The money is intended to flow into education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy economy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects, which are implemented by the Cohesion Fund. The credit contract over 100 million has already been signed before, the current agreement concerns the use of EUR 200 million granted.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan contract is also intended to be used for the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million is later decided in the context of the extension of the credit contract.
In the field of innovation, the contracting partners have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will be mainly flowing in research and development programmes at Debrecen University.
During the meeting, the U-Bahn line 4 also came to the language.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary has declared the details of U-Bahn financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The credit interest rates are EURIBOR-bonded, the loan is made available by the EIB with an expiry of 8 years, free of provision.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradises of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fantastic - all of Europe looks closely at the Balkan country mentioned earlier.
What, where, and who is still buying on the cheapest market in the EU, but which becomes more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max division.
Bulgaria is currently doubtless the most desired patch for real estate purchases in the Eastern European area, with cheap ski maps and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains, Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historical towns Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, but properties around Kavarna and Balcik are increasingly asked.
According to Reviews by Re/Max Analysts in Bulgaria, the country's inside also attracts investors earlier or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the very favourable region of Russian buyers.
The capital of Sofia also offers attractive offers - trade and office areas offer highest yields.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradieses, and thus also attract tourists alongside the summer and winter season in the two other seasons.
Prospective investors therefore already buy in large style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria are also seeking a change in their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested parties from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and in the ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to settle, buy either revitalised real estates of EUR 50-100.000, or downcoming houses of EUR 5-15,000, which they then self renovate.
Good connection and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are largely written, but also the closeness to a large city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday home (Bulgaria was listed in December among the Germans' Top Ten holiday destinations).
The third group forms business people investing with the objective of a medium- to long-term value increase.
However, real estate in the capital becomes more expensive, subject to the constantly growing demand.
Within the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but over the past five years there was a price increase of 21 per cent per year.
The valuation of real estate prices exceeds much the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percent
As environmental minister Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries consult Bali’s driving plan, in which the emissions reduction measures for the period after 2012, namely after the end of the Kyoto Protocol, are set.
There is currently a vigorous debate between industrial and developing countries.
The United States has already indicated that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but they would be willing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrial states are willing to support both financial and technologically the developing countries in addition to the reduction of emissions.
A agreement on the support of developing countries has also been reached.
The Adjustment Fund under the Kyoto Protocol is intended to be managed by a 16-headed Council, expected to be read in the UN Global Environmental Facility (GEF) as set out in the Piac és Profit.
Six percent of Hungary
Environmental Minister Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's effort to maintain its pre-resident role in global climate protection measures and to achieve a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 (measured by 1990 values), whether or not the "agreement after 2012" agreement is successful or not. The Union would even be willing to use for a 30% reduction, provided that other large industrial states of the world, or developing countries, are also willing to fulfil their commitments according to forces and responsible.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the countries which joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was a reduction of only 5.2%, while the EU and its 15 Member States had already undertaken a minus of 8%.
The target for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a measure that will fully meet the country, as can be read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The effort is high on Bali - however, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, whose importance also has been highlighted by the IPCC, the international, with the peace nobel price excellent scientific climate change committee of the UN in its recent report.
This would delay the reduction of emissions, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army throws on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan since March 2006 have loaded videos about operations against the Taliban into the network, reports the BBC.
The thumbnail cameras, which are fitted with helmets, will be controlled at the air weapons point in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political Message Inevitably
Soldiers of the Air Force have already joined 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been viewed more than 75,000 times.
The UK Defence Ministry was registered under "Defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFIs) stationed in Iraq have its own YouTube channels.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the air weapon has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Defence Ministry says, the contributions also serve to inform the people about the actual objectives of foreign intervention.
Such Published Propaganda is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, according to the Defence Expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, but these videos always carry a certain degree of political message, since they confirm the existence of the military measures decided by the government in their own way.
Americans advertising with game
However, the army must also fight for amateur recordings, which, besides carefully processed, censured recordings, also create in the network - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the something hypocritical, "official" propaganda films are spoken about the losses at most, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the way, from the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, many videos have already been loaded on the platform, but these "glutation" have recently discovered the British.
The Americans, however, advertise the something different, namely, with the freely downloadable shooting game "American Army", in which the player can drop into the skin of the soldier in the context of a more or less vital simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministry
Minister Monika Lamperth is not quite perfect: instead of a Christmas celebration, she organizes a work conference where her employees can leave the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministers celebrate with live music, other magnificent Christmas voting with Tombola or incentives to the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas vote, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already covered the offices.
The largest Christmas celebration of a Ministry is held today in the defense resort, but not the staff of the Ministry are expected to do so.
At the "Weisen Christmas celebration" children are awarded by fell soldiers, at the "Missionsfestival" family members of soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides approximately 25 million for the festivals.
Compared to other resorts, the National Development Agency (NFU) and the Ministry of Economics and Transport strikes.
The 4,32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live records and a Tombola release.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas on Wednesday in the House of the Country Justice (OIT) with concerts and a festival.
The sale rentals were 1 million Forint, the rest was spent for the more than 400 charged guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFU is also invited to a different Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU money.
For the celebration, the building of the Lustspiel theatre ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the competents.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas festival on December 7.
They did not have to pay rents to the OIT for the use of the premises.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivals were opened with a talk by the minister, after dinner it was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo] it was reported that there was no ball dressing or dressing obligation.
The Ministry of Health, Work and Self-Management are preparing for puritean celebration each.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for the employees in their own four walls for about 400 000 Forint.
Minister Monika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas celebration, but to the conference on the annual vote.
You are expected to have about 180 guests who - in the case of the press department - are only held with coffee and pogatsche, the celebration is going out with 350.000 Forint.
Minister of Suicide, Gordon Bajnai, and his colleagues will just be in the Aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenses were measured with 2,500 Forint per head - about this money there is a buffet reception with subsequent incentives.
Since the beginning of János Veres' term, the employees of the PM have celebrated this way each year.
However, there will be no proper party support - not only because of the minister's official speech but also because the festival was set for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites a new year's reception on the 20th century, the Christmas festival of the Ministry is this time.
The hundred guests are asked to go to Vajdahunyad castle in the city park ("Városligat"); according to the resort's information, the expenditure are measured with 1,000 forints per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple stop, to which only accredited foreign diplomas are loaded in Hungary.
The receptions organised each year begin traditionally with a short talk of the Minister and sound with a repulsive mob.
As reported by the relevant press offices on [origo] request, there will be no Christmas at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or Education.
Asked for the cost of Christmas, no information was provided at the press department of the Ministry of the Environment.
Anyway, more than 400 guests were charged to celebrate the art museum.
More and more forces mobilized for giant stripes
The Liga trade unions and the Hungarian Federation form their Coordination Committee on Friday for the stroke of unspecified duration starting on Monday.
On Saturday a protest-growing meeting will be held, on Monday - on the day of the folk vote on the health insurance law - the job depletion begins.
Strict-related, significant traffic disabilities are expected, as rail transport is almost completely discontinued, and the Budapest public transport operations (BKV) also strike until 13 p.m.
Details of the stretch on Monday will be published on Friday afternoon by the Liga unions and the Federation of the Federation.
A LIGA - MOSZ Strict Committee is also set up, responsible for the coordination of the actions on Monday.
On Saturday a protest-growing meeting will be held, and from Monday on, all organisations who have joined the stroke will put down the work for unspecified time, provided that no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the stroke beginning on the day of Parliament's vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, when the law is adopted, the Strict Committees shall meet in order to discuss the further approach.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even imaginable that it is only in the later evening hours, or at midnight, to vote on the Health insurance law.
Through the strikes starting on Monday, you will have to expect significant traffic disabilities: the railways put down their work for an undetermined time, the morning the majority of public transport and more than half of the volán companies are still.
At the same time, there will be many locations of motorway blocks in a direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is continuously updated on the Liga website.
Some organisations announced stress at an undetermined time, others planned a temporary reduction in work.
Until Thursday afternoon, there was no agreement between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the free trade union of the VDSZZ Railway, although just about Christmas holidays, more and more people are on the road.
According to previous reports, at the BKV from operating start until 13 p.m., at the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m., the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat are setting down the work for four hours, and the Teacher Association e.g. called the Democratic Teacher Association for 2 or 2-8 hours.
The Hungarian doctoral association struggles ageing throughout the country at various times, the EDDSZ, the democratic union of health and social employees, a suborganization of the SZEF, the Forum of Cooperation of the Federations, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the Liga is that the government withdraws the draft health insurance reform and presents a new concept of social discourse.
The second claim concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from the next year.
Assembly No. 3 is that the prosecutor professional groups will be allowed access to the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZ belonging to the Liga trade unions did not accept the offer submitted by the Ministry of Transport and now call for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Gard increases state risk
According to the Department for Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Garde founded in August with the support of the "Moving for a Better Hungary" have raised the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The "Risk Warning Report" of the Institute states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Gard, the highest political risk is the "discouragement of existing ethnic tensions between the Zigeuner and the non-Zigeuner population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
This is the main reason for the strategy of the Hungarian Garde, which is probably aimed at the provocation of such a conflict, is the research institution.
As reported, this is seen as a failure of the political officers: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groups, which have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungary counterpart."
It is presumed that this would intensify the problem that makes reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities and increase the likelihood of violent disputes.
The Research Institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian Gard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the local and foreign media, "had significantly damaged the picture of Hungary abroad, especially as regards confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary has continued to rise, so several organisations called "national self-defense associations" have been founded since summer 2007.
"These groups are common to define themselves as a civil organization each while they openly praise to prepare their members - sometimes armed - defense tasks (catastrope protection, national defense, order protection), on the grounds of police, army, or state itself," it said.
And moreover, this all happens according to the method that is trying to describe different political and party distortion of the population as a civil initiative.
The emphasis on civil character and the form of association is therefore not merely served to circumvent legal obstacles that could appear in the course of registration at the court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
As the analysis can be found, the activities of the Hungarian Gard also constitute a risk-exacerbating factor for relations with the neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Gard has been quoted as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, so some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the confirmation of their own anti-Hungary policy in the formation of the Hungarian Gard.
This all has an impact on the political stability of the region' - it was said.
From the point of view of the Research Institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Gard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Garde are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Garde, whose foundation was announced by the Legal Extreme Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
In the light of the emergence of the Bulgarian Garde, the Roma Mass Excursions, which took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents equally for the foundation of the National Guard, arguing that the objective of the organisation of "national protection".
In the past 17 years, they believe that a regular "Zigeuner Terror" has been noticeable in Bulgaria, but the State remained actless and different - so political capital.
And further, the initiative would have disappeared a vigorous debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said, the increased risk of ethnic disputes is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to establish their own garden for opposition purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Gard have shown many similarities to those of the Bulgarian National Garden, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also react to the threats by organizing their own protection, says the political capital's risk warning report.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said at the request of the news office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and risk-changed trends should be recognized, the public opinion will be informed, as in the case of the release of the risk warning report.
Festivals are not everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are precisely governed by law, so that the practice of re-disposing the working days around the holidays has now been established, but the next year is less of such days.
In the EU and in America, one also understands something else under "Feestday".
The Hungarian legal system differs between State holidays and unemployed days.
Work free days are usually church holidays, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate new year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working-free days - the last one can rest with the silver celebrates.
The whole year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are the 15th of March, which reminds of the 1848 Revolution, and the 23th October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, the state foundation, the work is celebrated on 1 May, on 1 and 2 November we remember our dead.
In addition, there are two holidays at Easter, Pentecosts, and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "workday shift" has proved in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of the extended weekends is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, is finally to be completed, the Minister of Labour has been set in a separate regulation for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees, public employees and officials of the public service.
Except are only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on the holidays.
Heuer, the working order is only brought together by the holidays at the end of the year: from 24 December the life to this country remains formal, since most of the days between Christmas and Silvester take time compensation, or the holidays that are specially lifted for it.
During the next year, more holidays fall into the week centre, or to the end of the week, so that there will be less re-disposals on working days than this year.
The calendar is first placed on the head around the day of work so that people can stay at home in four days.
Saturday, the 26th April will be a working day, so that Friday, 2 May, can be a resting day.
The second re-disposal is linked to the holiday on 23 October: On Saturday, 18 October, you will have to finish Friday, 24 October in advance.
However, the end of the year will remain in the sign of the holidays, after all lies and remains from 24 December, even when silvesters fall on Wednesday.
Six absurd little things to irritate colleagues
E-mails we forget to send, language messages that we never receive - harmless lies that did not notice us anymore: they bring "color" into everyday life at work.
The question is simply whether you are used to these little uncomfortable things, or you are better faced with the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstanding, consciously for other angry situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department," says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
Best of all, you regret it and try to make it good again by perhaps calling at the marketing department and repentantly confessing that you would have forgotten to post the message (this is the less usual method).
Mostly, the matter has been abandoned with a excuse.
Before breaking up in punishable excuses, you should think about what you can really make up for your colleagues in unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Do you borrow something that doesn't belong to yourself?
There's hardly a little more nervous than if you grab a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the tape was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost believed bullet writer discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without question, we should not borrow anything from the colleagues, because they are rightly angry when they find that something has gone away.
So, no envelopes or post-its from the office are put in the bag because it could meet yourself: nothing more if you need it urgently.
Do you think we're going to talk about the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a trap that has already been put into the world.
Who did what with who?
Where and why?
You should not bind the information (or suspects) about the personal life of colleagues, if possible, to everyone's nose!
And if someone opens up and tells us his inner secret, we should not abuse this trust!
It is best to swear as a grave, instead of aligning those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Reported sick for no reason?
If you call at the office to report illly on painful headaches, because you feel unfortunate or just want to rest, you should be aware of one: your own work, invisible executions, projects with fixed dates now have to do the colleagues instead of yourself.
So do not play badly with the colleagues!
If you already know in the past that you won't make it in the office the next day, or that something could be intervening, for which you have to stay at home, you should report it in time, so that neither the colleagues nor the boss will be confronted with the absence indefinitely.
total, cockpit, phone
You're just deepened in his work, but are you suddenly disturbed by the loud cooker of the colleagues?
Do you want to hear a phone call that you shouldn't have heard?
The colleagues should not be nervous with sums, singing, loud conversations (which are leading over their heads), tramps, persistent shampoos or narrows.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just deepened in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not completed in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important messages, you should not seek the fault of your own forgetfulness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
You best admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to recover the error or the failure is just too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training boxes and sleeping: Comfortable for home, but hasn't lost anything in the office!
Not even then you should dress yourself so much, if it would actually allow the workplace!
Just don't get too slim - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself so far that you dress yourself in the office - if you want, also beautiful and elegant!
It wants everyone to make it right - or how to become uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning.
From the radio a strange melody: the sound of a gee, coupled with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The pace changes, to the previous sounds the bass comes, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar, that's clinging to mr2.
The local music scene has long not just devoted us to qualitative electropope.
But now you even see the stack differently when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the local digital underground scene slowly contributes to a change of the overall image, and even if the garagenrock is "in" again with its guitar gewitch, the domestic electropop: There is new under the sun.
Baláz's Zságer started in Pécs, musiced even in the band Yonderboi before he - perhaps because a host house does not spend two pipes - began to crawl his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music that melted elements from Jazz, Electronic, and Pop, but only when he was asked to compose the soundtrack into a movie, he joined him (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Turök.
The formation, which had occurred at the beginning of smaller clubs, was only known to the broader audience when the magazine "wan2" ran its first album from 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, shortened almost the only, even in the west marketable trend set.
Without doubt, Zagar and his band were "trendy", but it was not interested if they would like to carry this brand.
The tape has responded as it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album now appeared with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open them new ways, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The term comes from the time when Baláz's Zságer was still on the road with another band.
The airy, flying play would be all right, but in addition to the etheric character of music, the time spirit and trends are the pure guitar, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer "The Puzzle" who lives in England presented himself at the premiere in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even been able to be the radio stroker - the newest from early to late pop music that sends the listeners with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas"), successively set the earworm.
So everything's okay (?).
The hvg.hu asked Baláz's Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz's Zságer: The term "lay music" doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two boxes in the pop music, not Mainstream and Underground, or alternative and pop, but commercially and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be sight and nonsense, but they can also be produced only for sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from a honest motive.
The listener's admission will also function in accordance with this principle, independent of languages and national borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: In abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or Twens on concerts, but also the older audience.
They pursue the trends in pop music that pass around them much more attentionful because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, music is not created to serve a purpose, but for a particular reason.
The role of the audience is mostly noticeable in the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but they are in turn only in the unreifable changes of the moment.
Yet one noticed me: if you want to make it right to everyone, you're not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a solist and has built his career in the west rather.
B. Zs.: We really don't go his way, but we're not trying to interpret this in our music again and again.
We see ourselves rather as team players who trust in the musical presence of the other and allow them to develop.
At first, comparisons of our work with Yonderboi were indispensable, as several of us came out of his band and took another way.
hvg.hu: "Wings of Love" is the first place in the charts of Mr2 Pet ́fi.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening consciously in the direction of a wider audience with a slightly more popular style?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit to then hold as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the final of the album with which we wanted to resolve the soundorgie and the a little more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why just she, what was the lead principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then the idea came to compile the choir from talented solitaires of the local music scene.
Thus the six-headed choir was created - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik
hvg.hu: Would you like to have the song likewise, or did the girls make it with?
B. Zs.: The number had been in the instrumental version for a long time, but when the material for the album was finished, we thought that this number was "nothing needed".
The order of accord has formally demanded a vocal vote.
I sing the melody in the same night, later they learned the girls.
Everything came practically on the face and awful spontaneously.
I remember, I was quite electricized at that time, but it has already needed the "Divas" too.
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
hvg.hu: both on the plate and at the concert, however, the impression was that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, singing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their song is not just accompanied by music.
They were also standing behind on the stage.
Is that intention?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were stood behind was such because of pure technical problems.
However, we consciously didn't want to let them have solo rolls.
The number also concerns the need to forget his ego a little, forget who came from where and where we are going, we simply allow us to raise these certain wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most eager song?
B. Zs.: In musical creation, there has been more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove did not want to work longer, but sometimes everything has been combined, as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts running and now that I have the album "lost".
At present it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From the Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Deceit Makler risked billions of feelings of minority
Groundless fraud
This is how his former employee Jerome Kerviel refers to the French Bankenriese Société Générale, owner of the current Komerční banka.
It came for nearly five billion euros.
But it seems rather that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it equally to his colleagues, in addition, certainly not incapable.
In contrast to all large bank houses, he recognised the crisis on the US hypothesis market in time.
"He's more mentally weak," was to hear from the mouth of his officers who showed him at the police.
However, as shown in Kerviel's statements, the French media, such as Le Monde's daily newspaper, published, he was a man who had earned its businesses at EUR 1.6 billion at the end of last year.
Crisis Not Only in America
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In summer he succeeded in earning half a billion euros just at the American crisis.
He had already seen the opportunity to do so at the beginning of the year.
In February, there was the first news that so-called sub-prime hypothecs, such as those who have been weak in income, or those who have already had a repayment problem, would be put into trouble.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe this and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had raised his profit to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Even when I earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain this," admits Kerviel and continues to say that he definitely kept nothing for himself.
During the hearing, he admits that he has falseed documents so that you can't get him on the nasty.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind light, even though the Eurex exchange was gradually interested in his business.
Risk Profit
Was he afraid to fly up?
I don't think so.
"I thought she satisfies the simple fact that I earned 1,6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, just after he finished his study at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51000.
After two years, he was already assistant of a maker and in 2005 he became an independent maker with an annual salary of $90000.
Yet, he knew that he would never deserve as much as others.
"Just during my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigator.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros on course losses of this title at the London bombs.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, let's let you
"That's like a snowball," he said to the policeman.
But the bosses were supposed to know about everything, or or did.
"As long as I earned money, one closed his eyes."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the great struggle came.
On one day, he lost a billion euros.
On one weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they come to him?
He suspiciously made himself through a vacation.
"I took only four days from the previous year.
A maker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want you to watch him in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed all of nine development programmes yesterday, through which the Czech Republic can come to EUR 14 billion in the next few years (approximately EUR 365 billion).
This is about half of the total that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into transport expansion.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to help entrepreneurs and companies gain funds for innovative businesses.
This will enable companies to gain finances for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
The EU fund money acquisition has been the most successful in the Czech Republic among the new accession countries.
Nicaraguanian Court confirms twenty years of imprisonment for Presidents
On Thursday, a court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year penalty for the former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (approximately $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his Hazienda at the Nicaraguian metropolis.
Whether the former Head of State (1997 to 2002) is back behind the grid of this Central American State, according to the AP News Agency is currently unclear.
According to the Chairman of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officers whether to put Alemán in his punishment at home or whether he must go to prison.
A court stated four years ago that Alemán had regularly moved money from the government on accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest followers.
Some of these money finally landed in a fund established by Alemán to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget is through
Yeah, it's done.
The state budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which has been adopted by the coalition majority without support of the opposition.
The current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because it had been presented by Minister Sobotka (from this party), and the ČSSD could not allow to reject him.
Unlike the vigorous debate before the vote on the suspicion proposal against the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Members accepted this traditionally lowly respected, yet very important law in all peace.
That's a paradox.
All government begins and ends with individual chapters and items of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy but is concealed by the power struggle of the government and opposition.
This is a more grateful issue for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to him.
A conflict among politicians is much more interesting for the public than narrow numbers.
The government budgets were under three weak points in the past social-democratic governments, which the budget for 2008 cannot eliminate at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure due to law, which is not only the pensions but also social expenditure which the "suspendant" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (Communists) decided last year before the elections.
The second is the deficitary budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness point.
The third restriction is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the largest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is public and somehow under control.
But a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many citizens' championships often made unconsidered debt incurred by excessive debt in their councils, except for revenue from taxes, taxes and bank credits.
In recent years, they have managed to pay these debts through massive sales of shares of energy and other supply networks that they have received in the course of privatisation from the State.
Now this source is already decorated.
As far as we only observe official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy for a few years, like the rest of the world, has run through a growth phase, whose ČSSD is unreleased.
This represented a unique possibility for their governments to settle public finances.
Instead, however, these governments owed the State even more.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a huge shame, which is mainly attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries that, in global scale, are at least threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which have, unfortunately, in recent years, been overwhelmed to a gigantic extent.
Although it has been successful to eliminate part of the unfair populistic expenditure that was adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if the next time there is no shift in the age of retirement and a reform of pensions, practically any policy in this country ends, and no matter who is in power, it will remain nothing but purely managed.
It is only easy to exaggerate if you say that then, from dominant politicians, they become officials who mechanically divide most of the tax revenue into pensions and social expenditure.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but can only stop the penalty of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit planned for 2008 of 70 billion crowns would be quite overwhelming if former governments had not spended in the last ten years, just what was going on.
If we do not want it to really come to the fact that dominant politicians will become pure administrative officials, then we must be patient and this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it is able to take up taxes and fees in order to seek peace when preparing further reform laws.
Only these allow for progressive enforcement of a balanced state budget.
Jiří Krejčí
Banks want to tackle crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis in financial markets together.
Thus, more than $100 billion will reach the currency markets through auctions.
On these auctions banks increase interest rates to which they are willing to borrow each other.
For example, the American Fed sends $40 billion on auction, and further 24 makes it free for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that the central banks of the individual countries agree on such coordinated approach to defence or defence of the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can grant," wrote a report to their customers Bernard Baumhl from the Economic Outlook Group Consultative.
"The coordinated action of central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," added Baumhl in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion because of unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analytics expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have really been afraid of what could happen when they decided to take this action," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have hard access to loans, loans will also be expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption, and the American economy would fall into a recession, possibly with effects on economic growth throughout the world.
The central banks have decided to do so after they have failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London interbank rate used for money loans between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow each other money, and that even though the US, Canada and Great Britain central banks had reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio by Tempus Consulting of the Agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of central banks contributes to the resolution of the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the USA.
Klaus: The discussions of ecologs are incredible
Global climate change claims to harm developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus again spoke about the problem of global warming.
The criticism was now referring to the final international UN Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, no green planet", he concluded that the discussions of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is inappropriate, which represents a strange mix of government representatives and such non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that they accompany and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a word fireworks that is only a replacement for a real solution to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed in the imagination of his book that his topic is very important for him and that he is therefore so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often meet on caricatures of my views."
Now, then, interested parties could read his attitude straightforwardly.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climate toologist, but he thinks he has sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is academic, capable of understanding and assessing professional negotiations, has experience in statistics and also be nationalists.
As the main statement of the book, he called the Theses that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal that there is no consensus among the scientists that the consequences of current changes are not too large and serious and therefore no threat, and that efforts to influence climate development are overwhelming, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he considers it unacceptable to force it as a person who has experience with totalitarian systems, to impose other unannounced views, he considers it to be a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly explained on questions of attendees that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take into account the relationship between effort and profit."
Klaus had talked about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people couldn't exchange their driving licence
600000 drivers missed the time limit to exchange their old driving licence, whose validity ends of the year.
Today is the last day you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities will be able to issue a new driving licence until the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers go on the roads without valid driving permit.
According to the authorities, mostly those who do not want to drive have not changed their licence.
While small places report a strong decline in the interests of the spring exchange, the offices of the capital are overrun with applications, and the interest in exchange grew this week.
The city management will complete around 2000 customers every day.
You have to get up for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 drivers have not yet changed their driving licence.
The exhibition takes a new driving licence 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Car drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and ride without a valid driving licence are threatening a penalty from January.
The wrongdoer pays a maximum of 2,000 kroner.
However, the police can also make it use of an admonition in the case of infringement.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, a punishment may also be imposed by the community that does not at all travel.
He could threaten a punishment of even $30,000.
The Ministry already called on the Officers to let mildness walte and to impose at least a punishment of 1,000 crowns.
According to the speaker of the Transport Ministry, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatens a thousand crown punishment.
The licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether to own it or not.
It is not a personal certificate, which everyone, or a valid, must have.
People who don't want to drive should give off their driving licence.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipality office or to send him there by subscription.
At the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, the drivers must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three years of time for the exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million further driving licences.
Court lowers punishments for detectives who were bound to Berdych
The former policemen Joseph Opava and Petr Koěařík, who were accused of having made a joint matter with the band of David Berdych, received 13 or 10 years of prison.
This was decided by the Prague Supreme Court in a judicial judgment, which reduced its penalty by one or two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Amt for the fight against organised crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
Against today's judgment, there is no possibility of appeal, only revision at the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych himself has been accused of this matter, he is first in the court.
However, in other processes he had already received punishments of a total of 16 years.
He can't be condemned more than that.
In January, a District Court spoke 19 people guilty, especially for engaging in seizures, and the Oberlandesgericht negotiated the appeal of 16 of them today.
Most of the accused objected from the beginning to the accusation with the reason it was a constructed case.
According to the Mediterranean District Court, police members in agreement with Berdych criminals provided information from sources of police, covered various robbery attacks and helped members of the band to withdraw criminal persecution.
The band surrounded Opava and Koěařík 30 percent of the prey.
The complaint is about the offences of the bands from 1999 to 2001.
Especially about robbery attacks whose victims often suffered severe injuries, but also for official injury and unauthorized arms possession.
In the case of home searches, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target pipe and a machine gun.
According to the accusation, the band has enriched many millions of crowns by its robbery attacks.
Except for nearly 20 men in this procedure, the courts recognized Berdych and a number of others due to other robbery attacks legally than guilty.
Other men from Berdych's circuits have to be responsible for another process, and other cases have not yet been brought before court.
To date, the main negotiation of Tomáš Pیta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish prison and are waiting for the final decision on their delivery for criminal persecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - invoice: 12 million
The lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Třebíč, wishes to request 12 million crowns of compensation plus judicial costs.
For each mother each three million, for the fathers every two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore not entirely in agreement with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it lies to a multifold too high," said Dostál after today's negotiation.
"In order to make us an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need the advice that the other party made.
We'll find out if it's at all worth of statement.
But we believe that this should be in hundreds of thousands of people together," stressed Dostál.
The amount should be moved between 100000 and 200000 kroner for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jablo'ov wanted a million crowns for each month she hadn't raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, the basis for remuneration negotiations was an opinion that had been prepared for him at the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children have experienced psychological and psychiatric injuries and stress symptoms in different strengths and depths.
The men deceived the stress situation better, even if they saw claims to prevent the confusion of the newborns.
The women, again, are worse with the reactions of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is going on right now, Veleba merged the content.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged nurses from the detention clinic in Třebíč on 9 December last year.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloěov.
The district headman of Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische Höhe) passed over 100000 kroner to each family at the end of October as a replacement for the expenses they had caused by the error of the hospital in Třebíč, which is part of the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In the case of doubt, they must go into a reserve fund, but only exceptionally they can apply for assistance to the institution.
Until now, the courts have raised relatively low amounts of damage to those concerned, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally by millions.
Polivka came around his Kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute about the brand "Königreich Walachei".
According to the judge at the District Court of Ostrava, he was the first to use the name "Walachish King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in collaboration with the actress in long years of work.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiation today.
However, according to his lawyer, the matter is probably not ended and his client is probably going to make a call.
"The dispute is about that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka parasite," said Polívkas lawyer after the negotiation.
Everyone imagined this actress and comics in the words "Walakish Kingdom".
The same opinion is Harabiš.
"We have a nearly ten years of work behind us.
Monetary purchases and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the cause is dispute about money.
"After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have something of it.
They want to win parasite at our work," he continued.
Appropriate business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walakish King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, the actress Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
But that did not hang together with the intention of justifying a fictional Kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš thought to spend walach passports.
From an original fun action, a business and entrepreneurial activity crystald out, then joined Harabiš the establishment of the company "Walakish Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka accepted the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered their owners reductions when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also argued today that Harabiš only used the only idea that Polívka made public in the "Manege" mission for his entrepreneurial purposes.
"The popularity of Polívkas has surely helped the project of the walatic kingdom," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project Harabiš and his team were who would have dedicated him intensely.
The collaboration of the conflicting parties today took place until the year 2000 when Harabiš for Polívka organized the official crown in Vsetín.
Since then, however, between Polívka and Harabiš began to raise the disputes that took place in the settlement "König Boleslavs I. until the Sankt-Nimmerleins-Tag".
The leadership role was then applied to Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka sent the complaint against Harabiš and his company that the court today rejected.
Clearness in the dispute could bring the contest prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half a princess.
This would lead to a new king.
Details and a date he didn't want to tell yet.
"We don't want to hurry anything over.
There should be something like the royal in the Walachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also log in quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Pre-existing swind
To say the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving characteristics were not much worth, the quality of walking, steering and also the processing could be described as more under-average.
But now his follower, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and it is for much better.
The combination with the name SW is still a bit further, and I just remain to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the too low head freeness on the back seats.
These complaints are no longer available, because the comb's carrosseries are designed so that not even two-meter men will suffer.
Continue Quickly
I'm just going through the interior equipment shortly to not repeat myself too much.
It is a quite successful design where I have objections only because of the careful middle tunnel.
There I would welcome a little more designal design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and the times are over when we may complain about too short seats or head supports.
The side content has also improved significantly compared to 206.
With regard to the space offer, you can also feel the enlarged dimensions of the carrosseries here.
The combi also eliminated the lack of head freeness.
A suitcase in the baggage room
But the main thing on this car is the charging room.
I must call it very well loadable and space-saving (also because of the unfoldable back window).
The hole rooms are equipped with guards that represent an ideal compromise.
They are not disturbing, divorcing, and keeping more difficult objects.
But let's talk about the load volume.
According to the table in the basic equipment, it is 428 litres, which is a more average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicles of this class in Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains around clearly traceable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a foreign vacation or when a child car is invited.
But to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the very flat charging room or the very low load edge after the back seat is wrapped.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder benzin engine with Hubraum 1.6 litres and a 88 kWp performance.
And honestly, it should look like a 1600-cubic engine that drives a family hatchback.
He's quiet, has a low consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him with his counterpart at Škoda, which sometimes seems like his excavation with a note, then I can only be enthusiastic about him.
The price list speaks bands
The price of this car is not just national.
But we need to remember that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious inside and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine at 329900 kroner is still at.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is quite much.
The exhibition Premium of the test car is beaten again with 80000 crowns in addition to books.
However, we had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc wiper release, electric window lifts behind and and...
Thus, the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but just count the additional equipment of a Fabia together and you will arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the decision remains which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools does not succeed
At British schools, the number of children from countries in Eastern Europe is increasing, causing indigenous fears of the further development of local schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has hitherto faced a number of obstacles.
British schools even determine where disputes between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe to British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually increasing.
Conflicts, chicans and robbery among students have transferred to the relationships between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had hit a ten-year-old boy with a iron bar.
The accused defended that the boy insulted her with racist contradictions.
The police also had to intervene on a Slovak immigrant after an attack by two minor girls.
The girls claimed to have made racist comments to the man and put him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus house and sucked on us.
When I told him he should stop, he threw us with apples and bears and then blown his seat," a mother of the Slovak student of the newspaper The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the residents called the dispute with the immigrants from Eastern Europe even as a survival struggle.
The cases mentioned prove that the mood between residents and immigrants at British schools is increasingly exciting.
In the United Kingdom, 70000 Slovaks have been reported to come to work.
Consequently, about 30000 Slovak students visit British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it really is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, that will meet if you only choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with cellars that offer on the beach of Pizza, ice and devastating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you can find this to a great extent.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever a human eye has seen.
Havanna once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spanish had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The hotel Nacional was created at the end of the 20th century.
Construction made it one of the heads of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered crime in the United States (especially during the prohibition), was enjoyed and supported on Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew, over the wide boulevards, cars that were among the cult symbols of the fifty years of the past century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he was hunting.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autogram.
The bar at the Nacional Hotel is mixed for you cocktails all after a wish.
And the cult cars of the fifty ride around in Havana until today, because the once imported Shigulis and Fiats in the salty and moist air have long fallen apart.
May Havana, especially his oldest part, have come down strongly, nowhere in the surroundings as many wonderful colonial sights as just here.
Other places are just put out, such as Trinidad.
In order to ensure that tourism brings the money needed urgently, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have not only been created in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of Holguín Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marod, which is unique in the world and mainly attracts railway lovers.
The sugar tube from remote plantations brought steam- and diesel-operated narrow tracks to the sugar factories.
Their car park has not been renewed over decades, so it is seen in the museum well-functioning locomotives, whose older companions are long elsewhere.
Trip targets
The most important places do not exclude the majority of Cuba's visitors.
So you don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
It remains to mention that in Hemingways already mentioned, a museum should not be avoided by the person who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The luxurious vegetation grows on calcium floors.
The Mogotas, limestone hills and felsens, strawly up from the valley floor, gathered into their hollow rooms into fertile soil, which also covers the distressed rock areas of dense growth.
This valley is where the best Cuban tobacco may be cultivated.
In his final form you can meet him when you visit one of the Havana cigarette factories.
It may also seem interesting that there was the chilenic consequence of the "Major Zeman" series.
Trinidad
An old city, which was founded shortly after the Spanish had colonized the island.
Fame and wealth brought her into trade with slaves and sugars.
The wealth appeared in the delicious beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has changed hardly for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is such a remote place that there was no road there in the fifty years of the last century that would have connected the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to being neglected.
Nothing was built there, but therefore nothing was ripped off, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the beach of Playa Ancón or the "dal of sugar factories".
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where music does not swear until the morning.
Baracoa
This small town in the east of Cuba refers to some as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo there must overcome high and crushed mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly affected by human interventions.
This eastern pre-post of Cuba has included UNESCO in its World Heritage Index, thanks to the unaffected nature of the UNESCO.
There the best chocolate is manufactured, the church shows the cross of Columbus (in fact it was about a hundred years after the journey of Columbus), and from the hill, where the former castle, the current hotel El Castillo, stands, are seen several table mountains of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the room, the cigarettes, the Sierra-Maestra mountains, the swine beach and the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban cartridge Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves admit about all this could be written on many sites.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, claims Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO should, according to the words of Defence Minister Robert Gates, draw up a specific plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to its ideas, so in the Scottish Edinburgh, the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed to do so.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban sides, the eight participating countries also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, by its Defence Minister Robert Gates, called on the NATO units to be more active, the UK considers the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan Government and in strengthening development aid.
"In Afghanistan, advance development is detectable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to allow the inhabitants to begin to develop the economy and security itself," says British Des Browne, Minister for Defence of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan Resistors has, according to the American Army, reached the highest level for five years.
The number of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, in the southern province of Helmand, even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached an absolute limit on the organisation and equipment of the units.
Concretely, they demand additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them," said Gates.
Today, the Secretary-General of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop, spoke similarly.
"I am not pleased with what we have available in Afghanistan to land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that is too little," said De Hoop of the Agency Reuters to conclude three-day conversations with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, among the countries involved, there is also a dispute about whether all all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, because of passivity, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fight requirements for them are not as high as for us in the south and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
This week the British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" called the German soldiers as faulpelze.
"Afghanic non-stuer disturbs: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a contribution supplemented by German soldiers' photos, playing the table tennis.
The German picture newspaper went over to the counter attack and printed a picture of a British unit at a rugby betfight in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debts will speed up to a billion in 2009
In each Czech is a debt of 84,000 kroner.
The total debt increased to 842.7 billion kroner by the end of September.
The government had planned to debt itself this year with 159,2 billion cones.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the improved development of state budgetary policies.
The government debts of the Czech Republic increased to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its data on State debts from the beginning of October.
In every Czech is a debt of 84,000 kroner.
Over the last year, the State debted more than 111 billion crowns.
"To now it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we may not exceed the limit of a billion Kronen until 2009.
Next year, the debts should move between 900 billion and a billion kroner," said David Marek, Analytics of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, Analytics of the Next Finance: "For override of a billion, we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, it depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it should show that the situation is changing on the political stage and politicians should be willing to save more, this could take up to 2010.
But I don't go out of such a change," he noted.
Growth of debts
State debt is derived from the debts of the government and mainly comes from the accumulation of deficiencies in the state budget.
State debt is financed by tax instructions, government debt invoices, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The national debt has now increased to 719.4 billion kroner this year.
The State’s foreign debts have now increased by 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable government debt reached at the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and decreased by 13.7 billion since June.
The average due date of State debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 per cent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really a lot in view of the good of the economy.
It is interesting that growth is particularly reported in debt debt debt debt debt debt debt debt is 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debts rise, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," said Pikora.
Better than Expected
The financing strategy and the dealing with government debts for 2007 shows that the government planned to take up 159,2 billion crowns for this year.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns, thanks to the improved development of government budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to State budget deficit, which is apparent to reach 76 billion crowns this year rather than the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum fund for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion kroner, a 10 billion dollar reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government debt invoices for 43 billion and the rates for loans at the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
Because she gave a name to a Teddy bear, she was presented in Khartum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who had been accused of Islam's innocentness in Sudan, was sentenced by a court in Khartum on Thursday evening to 15 days in prison and subsequent excretion.
The British was accused of allowing six to seven-year-old students to give a Teddyber name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She would have deserved to be pissed.
Following several complaints from students at the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old primary teacher, who was working at the Unity High School of Khartum, was arrested at home on Sunday and accused of the insult of Islam in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese criminal law.
In fact, this matter takes her beginning in September, when the teacher invites her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the class enteddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school leader Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as the most favourite forname.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but especially a very common prename in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature My name is Mohammed .
The bear himself had no sign with that name, but the problem is simply that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered to be insulting Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, declared that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything that she could get close to a religious belief, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, his opinion is only an innocent mistake.
One opinion that shares many students of the teacher who describe them as very careful to her students and as a person who never speaks in the class about religion.
It is noted that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common name given in the United Kingdom, for which there are 14 different ways of writing in English.
This preliminary name, often selected by Muslim families, is considered a kind of honor offering to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But how are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
May you give him a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating session in Vienna, there was no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo ended on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion session, without overcoming their controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not reach any agreement on the status , explained the European intermediary Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With the emphasis that peace is at stake in the region, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina urged to fulfil their obligations to maintain peace, and to continue the discussions beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violent acts are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the Conciliations on 10 December
The intermediaries of the Troika, which unite the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet in Serbia and Kosovo last Monday.
The future of the Province inhabited to 90% of Albanian speakers could be clear if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian intermediary Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council until 10 December.
The discussions of Bathen, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika last August of the UN had received the order of a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans expect their contract to end on 10 December.
The Russians who had already blocked the authorisation of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council will continue the negotiations beyond this end date.
Russia was and remains speaker of a negotiated solution, an agreed solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under the UN administration for eight years, the Western countries believe that independence is the only solution with the future under EU supervision.
Pristina is willing to announce this one-sided if the Security Council should not decide for its benefit.
Belgrade consists of stronger autonomy
Unfortunately no agreement was reached , the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been conducted since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Cosovarian Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the Province, shared his regrets.
However , he added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past resulting in murders and deportations .
Domino Effect
On the other hand, Serbian President Boris Tradic believed that a compromise was always pursued and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of an unilateral declaration of independence in the province.
Belgrade considers that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that has been so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had shown that any decision was taken solely and solely in the Security Council, where their Russian alloy has veto law.
The House of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision from the series of the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia , explained Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists replied to Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on status and added that any unilateral declaration of independence from the Albanian speaking population will expire in agreement with the western countries.
Bush unlocks an agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was gathered on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israeli and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further explained that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately in order to find a final regulation of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must set up his colonization work, explained Bush, reminding the two parties of their commitments with regard to the timetable for peace which they agreed in 2003.
The Chairman of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities, at the end of Abba , are aimed at a peace agreement which will clarify all open issues without exception and including the central issues .
This name covers the three grave problems that are mainly rotating the disputes between Israel and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees, which were disfellowshipped from their home country, which is in the present state of Israel.
According to the American President, Abbas took the word and claimed that the coming negotiations were carried out comprehensively and thoroughly and providing a regulation for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the word on his part, he committed himself to conducting the future arms stop negotiations directly and without interruption and to endeavour to finish them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for implementing his vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israelite, which are next to each other, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has received an insurance in this sense of Bush before it has decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan adopted by all Arab countries to the way of peace offering Israel, in exchange with its withdrawal from all Arabic territories occupied during the war of 1967, including Eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a cross-road in the history of Middle Orient, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects, the Saudi-Arabic prince in his interview with the Arabian daily newspaper financed by Saudi money.
According to the lawyer, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are facing.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations by the National Police disciplinary Authority (IGPN), on Sunday, shortly after 17 a.m., a police car on Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but was on strip, and drove with 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a speaker of the police.
A green motorcycle of the brand Kawasaki, without authorisation, thus not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two youths without helmets, driven at very high speed.
It rammed the left side of the police car after it had disregarded its procurement from the right, a policeman continued to explain.
The alcohol controls carried out in the vehicle passengers are very negative.
The state of the wagon (protected cotfly, sprayed windscreens, screwed stalks) proves the stain of the stalk.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the State Attorney of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that she had entrusted to the IGPN a survey on the "Facts of unwilling human murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger" in coordination with the main management for public security of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor explained that she excluded the determination of the IGPN at this stage of responsibility for the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, which were heard on Sunday evening, have confirmed the version of the police, namely, that this small power wheel has arrived relatively quickly on her left side.
Yesterday, a kind of ribbon, certainly caused by the riping of the footbreaks on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had stayed in one another until the police were able to brake.
Vehicles have been captured and will be subject to technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were obductioned yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor made the round, as a result of the police would have left the accident location very quickly, and that without providing the two youths help.
Although the IGPN remains careful, it would also exclude this matter concerning any serious errors.
According to one police source , this is a difficult aspect of the investigations for which further investigations are necessary and in which one must take very care .
Libération has hit an eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to live her again, says this Witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman hanging.
Two more tried to relive one of the youths who called the fourth.
In view of the tension that had evolved rapidly and, as it appears, due to the certainty that the people present had about the unforeseen situation of young people, the police of colleagues who had arrived at the accident site were taken into the car.
According to this statement of witnesses, the rescue forces arrived about twenty minutes after the police have gone.
They have also used heart massages, but in vain.
I won't allow it to be claimed that the police forces wouldn't have helped youths.
You've been first assisted with this youth.
The fire Force came right away.
It was all done to try to save her, on her part, emphasised the prosecutor.
In Pakistan, tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistan Police has defeated the first demonstrations since two days before General Musharraf had been called the emergency.
According to testimony, some 2,000 lawyers in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, who were demonstrating against the measures taken in the context of the emergency, were injured by the tear gas granates, which put the order forces there.
After that, they threw stones with which they hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios were found in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police attacked and injured lawyers.
Several people would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, resulting from a wave of approximately 500 arrests of oppositional, human rights prosecutors and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were locked to prevent the congregation.
Other demonstrations had been found in Multan (midden) and in Peshawar (Northern East).
On Monday, the lawyer movement received the support of the religious parties united in the mighty alliance of Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president invited the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the emergency, and to those who have put an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise is no longer applicable
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure that was announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's re-elective in a position in direct election on 6 October.
The chairman of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was withdrawn and triggered.
All that we represent is illegal, anticonstitutional and unlike the decisions of the Supreme Court, the magistrate of the newspaper The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the superior command over the army and to become a civil president is no longer valid since the call of the emergency, explained on Monday of the Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would issue his military uniform until 15 November, the date on which his first term of office ends as President.
The Vice-President for Information also confirmed that the elections of January could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistan government declared the reputations that were hardnicked in the country, according to which President Musharraf had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy army leader.
More than one third of the pregnancy is still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after adoption of the Newwirth Act, which allowed the contraception in France, one of three pregnancy (36%) is not planned, as a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined) shows.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of anticonception such as the pillar or the spiral still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age that uses the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of the contraception prevention has nevertheless enabled better control of fertility.
In any case, eight out of ten births are carefully planned.
In one of five pairs even calculated precisely on the month, and, if possible, in spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the occupation of the International Space Station (ISS) will have spent more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is essential for continuing scientific work at the station.
A guarded exit, which, due to its duration, the removal of resident modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools bought by the astronauts to perform the repair, achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had retrieved the Harmony module from Discovery, a large cylinder-shaped part, which will soon take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module lab.
But you must be able to supply them with electricity.
So the second task of the crew was to implement a 17,5 tons of heavy power production module through solar collectors that was already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After moving it, the crew made itself to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module whose range is 76 meters.
And then it happened that one of the collectors, who were folded up like a cordeone, was damaged by a sticked cable on a length of about one meter.
The restructuring was stopped to no longer damage the collector.
The astronauts, who originally left the Discovery space and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was incorrect, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around at the end of the 30 meters long remotely controlled arms of the space trailer, which had been fitted at the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very skillful, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old doctor was chosen to surge the injured solar collector.
After carefully assessing the damage, he separated the wrong cable and mounted a kind of rail at the damaged place.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the locks, and, by inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey hit, wrapped with isolator, to prevent the sun collections, which generate several hundred volts, a electric stroke, the astronauts had discovered and burstled on board the station.
When the action was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely folded up before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the Discovery space to expect the return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctified on the exchange
After announced that it will have to spend between EUR 1.2 and EUR 1.4 billion in order to counteract the residues of the A400M, the share EADS is currently showing a significant decrease in the Paris exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% at EUR 21.96 at the Paris Exchange.
The group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 again, referring to the development of the A400M engine only slowly advanced, which delays the fly's virgin flight.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military transport plane amounted to EUR 1.2 to EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than a billion for Airbus , announced the European manufacturer's parent group of EADS.
Due to these costs, the EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results on Thursday, without further details.
The group also indicates that the assessment of the new costs is related to the six-month residue.
As a reminder, the business performance of the EADS has fallen from 86% in 2006, essentially due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier A380.
The group originally provided for an initial delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of the status Quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting when counting the urns: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's Party, United Russia.
After a very locked electoral struggle, she confirms her pursuit of stability, even of authoritarism.
Three days before parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message to the public broadcasters, which has already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as a top candidate of the United Russian Party, the Pro-Kreml Party, for which a surprising victory announces itself.
Yesterday, the President had nothing to look through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and satisfactioned to deliver a new attack point against the Western powers accused of interference - his favourite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of true democracy and hope we have honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of opposition, they have become there.
It pranges a polluted electoral struggle by oppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the oppression of the demonstrations in the last weekend, Ex-Schachweltmeister Garry Kasparovder has been sentenced for unauthorized demonstration to five days in prison, according to his lawyer continues the visit ban.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without excitement, there are two much further questions:
Who will join Putin's follow-up as President?
The Official Journal announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections on 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to make themselves known until 23 December.
Since he was elected in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot join a third mandate.
And now there is no follower.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Chairman of the majority of Parliament and the all-mighty Party of United Russia, the Government and President will choose?
Whatever it will be, at parliamentary or presidential elections, the power of the past will triumphate.
This is tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not the Lord of their destiny, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the State University of Sankt Petersburg even continues to decline: the civil society has slowly developed in this country, which has been Christianized five centuries to Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has reconnected to the model of a patriarch state, which was perfectly accepted by the population, so more, since this new patriarch was not a terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman says from the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians are refraining from free pieces of personal responsibility, which they have shown shortly after the destruction of the USSR.
Why do you think so long?
This phenomenon concerns all societal layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands to keep the status of Quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local election lists of the United Russian Republic.
The new freedoms coming from the west are often equal to chaos, as in the 1990s.
Generally, stability is preferable.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What are you thinking about?
Those who are in power aren't so bad why they are dissolving?
A Heavy Reason
After they have been treated more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the destiny of 17,5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now free to access.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which were placed in Bad Arolsen on a total length of 27 km, could not be seen until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individually and named, that is, at the request of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, the eleven Member States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research to be carried out, especially about the deportations of prisoners, the inhabitants of the concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, explains Reto Master, director of the archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several countries, including Germany, were opposed to making these name-related documents available to the public because of the tender character of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some deportation sacrifices.
The inmate lists of the concentration camps or the prison orders issued by the Gestapo had been compiled for a practical reason after the war: to find civilians who had been deported or subjected to compulsory work, and possibly to provide them with a means of proof of their arrest in order to eliminate the way to their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees are still editing tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
No fundamental new things can be expected in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Antisemitism at the University of Technology of Berlin, 2006, explained.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, the mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches the EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is the most important trade partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European trade minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, indicated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations in order to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean). The mutual trade between India and Europe already reaches the EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A Free Trade Pact will make the two economic areas enormously advance and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans , confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most frequently exported products from India, as the European Commissioner further explained. The Asian and European giants exchange annual goods of EUR 47 billion and services of EUR 10 billion, this week had Daniéle Slamja, chairman of the European Commission's regulation in New Delhi, and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India meet their eighth diplomatics in New Delhi on Friday, at the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England notes the disturbance and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England showed anxiety about reducing the current recurring anxiety about the credit conditions, and announced an offer of 10 billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, a offer with an unusual duration.
In order to weaken the fears of which the conditions on the financial market will be particularly hard at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about the way in which they are to organise their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of their spare deposits during the maintenance phase starting on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it shall state in a notification.
The Bank continues to explain that this way, on December 6 GMT 12.15, 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) are put into circulation, to the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time the BoE runs liquidities for five weeks in an open market operation.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BOE adds that it is ready to take further measures to maintain the different interest rates of inter-bank loans with its basic interest rate from day to day.
On Wednesday, the different intermediate interest rate from day to day was 5.829%.
The three-month interest rate has penalized to 6.6%, a little higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis from summer, the sums put in circulation by the Bank of England were linked to criminal charges that the banks had prevented from taking advantage of them.
According to some rumors, strengthened by the development of the pound price, in contrast to the euro, many were in favour of signing for the sums that the European Central Bank had put into circulation, more favourable interest rates and with safer discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to review the PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist law template for purchasing power, which is the same as rejection of the text.
The text produced in the context of a socialist Nische (meeting at the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, of which the majority of 50% of the employment allowance, the re-introduction of the TIPP fleetant, a transport check or the limitation of rents.
After the UMP and NC voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which offered partially violent word exchanges between majority and opposition occasion, a few hours before the television contribution of Nicolas Sarkozy about the purchase force.
The leader of the PS Marc Ayrault's members announced that his group will present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative plan for the correction of the finances that had been examined last week by the Assamblee.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promoter/Producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is a honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, served as an example for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 informed on Bilboard.com.
C3 organises the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for campsite vacation.
The festival will probably take place on a 500 Acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia on August 8.
The leader of the Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most renowned festivals.
In 1989 he took over the lead of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts around 80 000 people each year.
In 1999 Melvin Benn added his portfolio to Leeds Festival, and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn as a co-owner also cares for the production, for the license concessions and for the organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now take up to 177.500 persons.
Charlie Jones from C3, Glastonbury describes as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been there, says that his company and Melvin Benn work parallelly together to offer a European festival event.
We chose Philadelphia as a market and work zealously with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been stuck in police debates on the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly, we have been able to discuss Melvin Benn and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will eventually benefit the population."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in the Grand Park of Chicago in 2005 after it has been profiled together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002 in the world of the festival.
In 2007, the two events could achieve 9.8 million dollars and 11.8 million dollars in gross tax days.
These two festivals take place in a urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while ours take place rather on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in some way, at the same time, to convey the impression of a rural festival on the European and a city in the American way."
Vineland is about half the way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, takes the burden on this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to give up the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to take up a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large" in about 80 000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasty rock, but music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partner of C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Ballboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the Terminator does.
These lock attempts include the delegated tasks.
A political "highman mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is prompting " Runaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate with the governor?
"You must be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds the conditions in Montreal beneficial, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are considered to be the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the pre-application of the cinema is at the moment a priority.
The hunting for the Oscars started.
At all festivals on the west coast, although the one of Sundance, the one of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about producing the films from Quebec, to evaluate them and to ensure that the producers interview.
The dark age had a successful idea on the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
He will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented on the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month, Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Is the stock exchange a final year-rally in advance? Disagreement with the experts due to the U.S. hypothecrisis
With almost five weeks until the annual account at the exchange, the investors are already running their hands with regard to the next end-year rally.
Nevertheless, experts cannot create safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically viewed, the month December on the exchange usually is associated with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to produce short-term forecasts and only on the basis of statistics.
Although other experts do not accept such a strong increase in the course in the last weeks of the year, they note that the exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant. They invest mainly in pension funds due to the lack of safe share funds, which are strongly affected by the rising trend towards assets.
Accordingly, according to these experts, the exchanges will rather have a more lateral, market fluctuations influenced price trend, especially because we cannot estimate the amounts of the possible reduction in the interest rate of the US Note Bank, an uncertainty that is mainly due to the rising raw oil price and the risk of the increase in inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the BPI sales department in Spain, agrees that it is a guardful time to announce a future market-rally.
The chances are not very good, insured by the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its maximum mark on 8 November of 15.945,7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, Analyzer at Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could successfully complete the year with almost 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional grant of the pension fund each year.
Nevertheless, the expert stresses that this year the things could develop something different; especially because of the end year-rally that is already in the second week of December, and then directly after the bridge day to the day of the Constitution.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, analyzed by the Bank Inversis, the previous market situation assessments are at a nearly technical level, which could lead to a deviation of the index values in the nearest future, depending on the consequences of the U.S. hypothecene market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
In selecting the values that are to drive the Ibex to new maximum levels, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney is dear that this year the large values are in line.
The expert would be among the value winners the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at that time.
However, Federico Olucha of the Bank Inversis assures that the increases will be associated with the banking and industrial sector.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In recent months, the ACS was on a curriculum and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same path, according to the expert.
As regards increased consumption behaviour during Christmas days, the market will be determined in the last half of the periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive turnover results, even if they are only represented in a small number on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, the December only showed decreasing courses in two cases.
At the end of 2003, the technology flower led the stock exchanges from their crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end year rally.
This year, where Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, December showed an increase of 6.68%.
Whether 2008 will result in the fifth profiting year (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and can also show a final year's rally.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of his branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these establishments represent a large milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutes, since popular as the first banking group dares to prolong the opening hours of his branches from 20 to 30 p.m. on Saturday from 10 p.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The BBVA Group, which is also repeatedly informed of the extension of its opening hours in the branches, has not yet taken a definitive decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the trade unions appear to be aimed at an agreement with 75% of all branches on Saturday and open for it on a day of the week afternoon, if not for the customer.
Whether further banks join the new initiative adapting the business opening periods will depend on the experiences of the Popular Bank.
And just that is the intention that the popular is pursuing with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, due to their situation, can capture the buy-in customership of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large purchase houses.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not new, but changed opening hours.
To this end, the Bank will redesign the premises of the branches already in business zones and will at the same time adapt them to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of opening times is associated with a new space design of branches, which is characterised by a more current, colorful design.
The competent banking representative Ángel Rivera assures that restructuring would not require larger investments but resulted in an increased staff setting, as a branch no longer needed six but eight or nine employees.
The establishments, which will even be equipped with additional spaces for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept on nine branches in Madrid.
And the values of experience were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the roads Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seems to be a smart decision.
Popular is currently conducting approximately 2500 branches.
And 60 more that operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specialized in immigrants and also show extended opening times, even on sun and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them will offer a wide range of non-financial services for sale instead.
We do not want to represent competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With phoneica they have provisionally reached the agreement to sell mobile phones using external banking staff.
The Spanish private broadcaster Telecinco doubles its stock value for the first time and thus overrides his rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, declared his satisfaction at the end of the stock exchange. The transmitter led by him had increased his value by two times his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, damped his joy: that's exactly what's hurt me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had fewer losses, he found.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they have not fallen too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its past this year's losses to 15.66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches the EUR 4.488.88 million, with mediaset controlling the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento is only involved by 13%.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40,5% since January, so its market value of 2.193.46 million is half.
On the other hand, the market value of other exchange-notified communications companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, in Prisa (exhibitors of Cinco Días magazine) to 2.518.53 million and in Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, so Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question still appears to which extent we can actually act in exchange technically, at what price and how we can make it lucrative at customer level.
Telecinco explained his project a week ago to increase this year to the first television broadcaster with more than 1,000 million gross wins from advertising. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the broadcaster would increase its advertising rates by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million of the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine exchange months (up to 734,4 million), while net revenues from television business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for the better exchange rate of Telecinco compared, the analysts see at the high payout ratio, which the company could have been able to show up to the present date: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría led a 100% dividend payment.
Vasile, however, assures that after buying 33% of the shares of end mole, with mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for an official notice.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have been much more and more mentioned.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose shares we could already increase by buying 33% of end mole shares.
According to the analysts, the market currently shows some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation at Telecinco by 4% for this year and by 7% for 2009.
This is the result of a reduction in the expected growth rate, from 10,5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% in 2009 to 5.1%.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: sets on its high efficiency rate and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: Telecinco (purchasing) as a result of the many incentives and the prospering market a more favourable position at than antena 3 (hold).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to restore expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the Parliamentary preparation, which has been finalised today with the Congress Decision in the Senate on the additional/amendment requests of the project, the Government published the provisions set out in the new law with the intention of allowing the entry into force of both rules until the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congress and Senate Members, who pursued the aim of their negotiations and votes to set up the best possible arrangements to ensure the security of investors and to regulate the individual entrepreneurial activities in order to ensure that the market is generally efficient.
In addition to modernising the financial markets, the MIFID, which re-evaluates the Securities Services Regulation, will improve investor protection, increase the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the different control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables specialised companies and natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial services companies (ESIS) to the consultants which are associated with investment and intermediary companies of securities.
In addition, it extends the number of systems for carrying out financial transactions, so that regulated circulation markets are added to the multilateral systems of the effect transaction and the systems for the internationalisation of trade contracts, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
In order to facilitate the CNMV's control tasks, the law obliges investment firms to register the focus of their company's profile, the confrontation and the forms of handling risks on the market.
The Congress's Economic Commission subsequently proposed further changes, confirming that the debt debt depreciation provided now has to be considered as complex financial resources for the investor due to its high risk level, through the U.S. hypothecen and banking crisis. (US Hypothecencrisis).
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the work areas of diplomat economic scientists was used; 30 years after 1977, the regulation, which restricted the work areas reserved for economic scientists, was adopted.
On the other hand, the Senate identified new positions in the financial sector as those of the economic media that works on a foreign account do not require authorisation from the CNMV and its services for commercialisation of products and for customer gain at the same time offer several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) has increased by five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation rates within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication corresponds to the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek a local and quality comparison with US products by the disclosure of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be established in advance by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to assess the information not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) reminded that the pre-determined indicator only serves as a guide value and therefore does not match the final result that will be announced in the coming 14 December.
Consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Vice-President of the Government and the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, the increase in VPI was a temporary development in November, while assured that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, Solbes found in the Halls of the Congress building that even if the current number is not good, the inflation difference in Spain with the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November there were fewer surprises than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of about 4% , the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs announced with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin calculates Northern Rock revenues of more than 42 billion euros in the next three years
The stocks of Northern Rock have fallen by more than half after the Bank had requested an emergency credit to the British Note Bank in mid-September of the last year, and in the meantime they are only 12000 million pounds (that is EUR 16.800 million).
At that time, the assets of the bank amounted to 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has been significantly declined within two and a half months by the loss of confidence of customers and even despite the government's hundred percent warranty that the money will continue to fall until the end of the crisis.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, has to spend about a quarter of the revenues of the British banks, which will be composed of the installations of the next three years, in order to acquire precisely those 18 billion pounds needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The group of the multimillionary Richard Branson, known by its outstanding advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to allow 50 000 million pounds (approximately €70 million) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
This week Northern Rock named the Virgin Group, in which three other companies are involved, as his preferred tenderer to lead it from the insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested for suspected suspicion of participation in urban corruption
On this morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the town of Totano (Partido Popular) in the town of Murcia, due to the urgency of development in urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipality council and the chief of the municipal police were arrested.
José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales last May, currently member of the Partido Popular and at then Chairman of the municipality of Totana, and could, according to information provided by the Cadena SER broadcaster, be the original wiremaker of the complot.
The officials continue to search the business documents of the municipality and the City Planning Ministry and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused by Juan Morales of the main suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to the information provided by the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular , and therefore privileged Member Juan Morales was arrested when leaving his client's residence due to important burdenful documents that are intended to be related to the complot.
In addition, other sources of information report from the supposed order payments of Morale to a Galician construction company which provided for the conclusion of a urban contract in which the construction of a large area of 200 hectares was decided.
At the moment, eight people are in an investigation.
Bono agrees to accept the candidateship of the PSOE in Toledo and, the fall of a election victory, at the Congress.
The former Defence Minister José Bono has adopted the offer of the President-in-Office and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Accordingly, he will introduce the list of PSOE candidates at the forthcoming general elections in Toledo and, in the event of a socialist election victory, take over the office of the Congress President.
So it announced José Blanco, organisational secretary of the PSOE, and Bono at the press conference after a meeting with Zapatero was held today at the headquarters of the party.
The Head of Government believes that the offer to the former ministers is justified, as it is important in the policy to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the event of a victory for the socialists, the politician from Mancha would appear to be the chairman of the Congress for the Party at the coming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who had announced the last 15 November that he would no longer join the next general elections, end his career in public policy and instead take action in the university area for climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that the President of the Government had constantly urged his return to political events since his departure two years ago.
In addition , he pointed out that, as in the appointment of the Vice-President for Economics , the party would not want to prevent the citizens who would take over the positions of the Congress President in the event of a voting victory , and called this a act of transparency .
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to convert the Chamber into a house of respect and not the insult or shout to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, one gains the impression that the only place where you can't speak quietly and let alone in Madrid is the congress; the President of the Government in the Senate was interrupted once up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and indicated that he did not want to raise the appearance of having already taken over the office, since otherwise his political opponents would call this arrogance.
Climate Propaganda
Since the climate debate undermines both the sceptics of climate change as well as those who put ahead of a social and political debate in this regard, an unfamiliar criticism, the movement as a whole must show a strong cohesion.
Especially when it is a leader of the movement, who, as in the case of the President-in-Office of the Government, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, puts it in an explanation of the action or non-commerce of its government, which has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain is at the top of the countries which have at least fulfilled the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for non-compliance with the requirements, on which sectors this is due, and why has his government, who had proposed the Treaty with the planet, not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to present to the Spanish citizens the measures planned by him against climate change without delay.
Which companies will be affected by the behaviour of citizens to be changed, the individual and collective savings measures and the economic consequences of this.
More precisely, who needs to sacrifice and will pay for the saving of the planet.
However, there will be no such explanations in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Because the measures that can really be applied against climate change are unfavourable.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the PSOE's proposed benzin Cent, Zapatero, appeared to be so dangerous as to be so dangerous that he was forced to withdraw the proposal.
Accordingly, it is now true to save the planets with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty words without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, the Commission, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its contracts with the planet, the politicians who are otherwise suitable for election campaigns must not speak or accuse or demand, but rather follow the demanding edition, delight meetings and enthusiasm others with his mildness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its pure virtual nature and therefore does not imply that the bike will become the only means of movement in the future or we may only refresh ourselves with a factor.
The Mayor and the Police Chief of Totana due to a suspected integration into a urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana belonging to Murcia, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur were still arrested because of the discomfort of urban infringements, it was today called from research circles.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where it was brought to the municipality office and in its premises until now, surrounded by many agents who had also arrived in the urban administration and the municipal construction leader Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the flags already undertaken in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, which showed that more than 2 million hectares of unfinished building grounds for urban construction projects should be redesigned under the leadership of the Galician Construction Company Nuaria, which should create 4000 apartments on the ground after local administration has arrived during the last legislative period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested but were subject to a investigation procedure which is caused and implemented by the first court of Totonas.
The first six arrested ones have been sent to the judge today.
According to research circles, against the former Mayor of Totana and the current independent PP member of Juan Morales is also identified.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current, resident friend in Murcia is suspected.
The Chairman and holder of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the manager of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G., whose company is to have served as a sub-group of Nuaria and received the sumer money.
The investigations are carried out by the Municipal Authority against urban offences, under the supervision of the central unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, carried out further 11 further investigations, most of them in companies which were directly related to the arrests undertaken in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time only one person was arrested in Totana: the owner of a regionally known poultry breeding industry that should have acted as a middleman.
The construction group Nuaria was assigned to build the largest residential complex of the village belonging to Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, one golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2,2 million square kilometres of area in Totana, which was intended to rebuild it. The aim was to achieve a construction project, which would increase the population of the community to 25,000 people.
The Nuaria Group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which promote the sale of real estate; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking lots of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree, we will turn away from the expression book of the month and instead try to find a price name of other name with appropriate competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are heartfeltly invited to make your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, (Finland is also at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; randomly on the day whose issue contained criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the field of philosophy has become the theme of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is a Abiturian who quoted the works of Platon and Nietzsches in his news.
The Chairman of the Educational Council for the philosophy, Pekka Elo, invited the teachers to take a more critical position towards Plato in an interview with Helsingin Sanomat, and proposed that the doctrine of Platon be deleted from the sub-class learning plans for the philosophy at gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads into the criminal lawbook:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of law that is committed to six months' prison.
However, if you again rob a music business below a value of EUR 400, this is only considered to be a simple infringement (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of EUR 1000, then the steal is deemed to be criminal, yet the penalty is lower than a download (Article 234 Criminal Code).
C. If you clause a car and return it forty hours later, the penalty is still lower than when you download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a battle than in a music data exchange.
Participating in a rebellious dispute brings a prison penalty from three to 12 months after itself (Article 154 Criminal Code), while the data exchange has resulted in a withdrawal of freedom from six months to up to two years
(Article 270 Criminal Code).
E. According to Article 184(2) of the Criminal Code, sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films whose authorization has not been performed by the authors is subject to a higher punishment than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should have the right, then somebody has screwed up his claims.

My home doctor gives me one of his long, strange research articles with the title: money leads to activation of certain brain areas, especially when the others get more of it.
So the feelings resulting from the monthly payout are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was developed by a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the Bonn University, and the results were published in the last edition of Science journal.
According to Bernd Webers, the author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Centre Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and his participant failed.
The researchers could see that brain activities were always very moderate if both participants were right with their answer and then received the same content; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not sure whether it really takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
State lawyer from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been unreasonable after the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Your office is located in the prosecutor of the court of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Their mandate will expire at the end of the year, and Carla will leave her office with a weeping and laughing eye, as the chief officers of the Srebrenica Massacher - who died at the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims - is the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on a free foot.
Their names are on the list of director Marcel Schüpbach from Switzerland as a template for the title of his documentary film La List de Carla (2006, not yet in Spain); a film that, with the pace of a police-thirler, pursues the Swiss state lawyer from Belgrade to New York in their project to explore the escaped criminals and to put pressure on the respective governments so that they closer their networks.
What insurance is the best for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a possible damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost burden, whose height depends on different factors, including age, gender, time of drawing up the driving licence, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Owning a car is just the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, one must be clear what we have to do with this.
Autosurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement shall be concluded in writing by means of an insurance contract stating that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and, in return, is obliged to submit the corresponding sum of findings in an injury case.
The insurance premium is the price of a insurance composed of several factors, including age, gender, time of drawing up the driving licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance companies shall determine their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contribution payments are also due in the event of a higher accident risk.
For this reason, both over 25 years of age and women need to make less contribution payments, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate thanks to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, as they, according to the statistical values and therefore also after the company's conviction, tend to be less accidents like alone.
The benefit to be measured to the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In setting up the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver also needs to study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that best meets his personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points that should be considered in the selection of insurance in order not only to take a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
Those under 25 years of age meet many obstacles, such as the low driving practice and the young driving licence.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete a full-casco insurance, there are still more valuable alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a full-casko with self-participation, so that the benefits of a full-casco insurance are covered, but offered at a low price.
This type of contract involves that the customer must pay a part of the amount resulting from the damage itself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher the lower the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera , the main representative of Spain at First Europe, a mediation company for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance that insures customers against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to lower the insurance costs; then your credit is increased by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic tariff of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment involves an increase in tariffs.
The level of credits and penalties depends on the company and their revenue.
If the company has a profitable year behind, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments , explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-year brand is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that by increasing driving practice the accident rate is lowering.
It is therefore most useful to decide for a full-casco insurance with self-participation.
Normally, young people can not benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving , explains the Spanish ruler of the European company and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginning.
However, in the case of a married customer who does not have children, it is more advised to complete a full cash insurance, of course only if it also allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
The insurers’ sides apply couples with children as customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full-casco insurance with self-participation (for a amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. If you received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which is first used for the third year of the vehicle.
They run more relaxed and have a larger purchasing force that allows them to make a higher contribution payment , says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners it is recommended to complete a full cash insurance with self-participation (in case of a amount of EUR 150), or to complete an extended insurance which is only used in a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it is necessary to note that car insurance is something very important not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage but also because it is high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan at the point for the eight-finale
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight on Tuesday in San Siro for the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals before the end of the Championsleague front round. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group while it decides on their participation in the shots.
The Italian team has already five points and has confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a disagreement in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow needs another one with nine points to ensure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not collect the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth game round, as the FC Milan will have to enter the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the mid-finale for the end, which will take place on the 16th.
Thus, this group will be completed before all others and the undecision in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadium to the expected result, even if both teams are trying to win. The Italians will not want to speculate the keltics Glasgow know that they would have a better starting position in the eighth-final in the event of a victory group-first.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be able to have a defeat at the FC Shakhtar's flapp. However, he should not trust too much in such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are able to participate; they had lost in Glasgow (2-1), but at the second game (2-0).
Thus, the mailanders will try to avoid the shots in the evening. The reverses hope to reach the second time in succession the eight-final of the redesigned championsleague after they have been defeated in the preceding game season in exactly the same round through a gate of Kaka in the post-play time (1-0) and by a zero to zero disagreement on the play.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the eight-final and its membership at the UEFA depends on its victory and a victory of the Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could, despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European mastership, reach the third place by a victory and thus participate in the UEFA.
20.000 people visit the first concert of Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In the Canadian Vancouver, the Spice Girls gave 20.000 viewers the start shot for their first tour after resolving the band in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of their concert at the stadium GM Place de Vancouver that the mood was excellent in the reunited band.
Approximately 20 000 people were able to live up to the concert in the sold-out stadium, showing a video about the history of the band that had provided for furore at the end of the nineties.
The reunion and the world tour crosses with the publication of a new album, which includes its largest hits and two more new songs, headlines and voodoo, which appear in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls were wearing golden armbands on the stage, which had given them the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience that led the GM Palace to glow, although the nerves of his wife's wife Victoria had banned him in the past days.
During the preparations for the Show, Victoria Beckham told us that the British Star has not seen our garderobe once, so I'm already excited about what he will think of the appearance.
Sporty Spice , whose withdrawal from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later the dissolution of the group, expressed its nervosity two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world public had changed that the feelings had changed to the spice girls.
And therefore I thought, why not, so I am glad to have made this decision, Chisholm said to the separation of the band that she had caused nine years ago.
The singer also told that the disputes were eliminated and, in the meantime, everyone was very pleased.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
For the first time, the group arrived in a special engine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, according to the report by the television broadcaster CTV.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received from a army of children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will appear next in California, San José (on 4 December) and Los Angeles (5th and 7th December).
They will enter the stage in Madrid on December 23th.
New fears of gas conflict between Russia and Ukraine
A new price struggle swells between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
The largest part of Russian exports of natural gas to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and each dispute between the two nations is very closely observed.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it needs to pay for the gas, Russia will charge higher transit fees.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced deliveries to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurs at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopol Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine needs to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be more calculated as the group agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from nearby Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversation," said Ukraine's Minister for Economic Affairs, Anatoli Chinakh, the Reuters News Agency.
"The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit fees [to Western Europe] across Ukraine."
In the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, Gazprom shortened delivery to Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which drastically increased prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas incidents, but much of them remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service has to improve the control of the pre-criminal registers for workers outside Europe, said one member of the control body.
The recommendation from the main financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in conjunction with the attack on Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also expressed concern about the fact that the Scottish State Health Service has no precise ideas regarding the number of foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample by five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqian doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a terrain car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in Old Bailey in a video transfer in October, and was charged with the contradictory bombing in Great Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service will carry out checks before the appointment of foreign employees in order to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review pre-criminal registers, the Agency does not have the responsibility to receive this information outside Britain.
The main auditor’s report now states, in addition to other recommendations, that the Board should adopt guidelines for the criminal register withdrawal which will help employers to control in different countries.
"Even though we found evidence of these checks in some staff documents, they were not carried out routinely." the report stated.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their research directives to a large extent before the appointment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved in order to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of foreign healthcare professionals."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that studies in advance of the appointment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could commit future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that current pre-release tests of the NHS Scotland are working well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will provide," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1.161 foreign employees, most of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, even because the boards had problems identifying those employees who were entitled to be inadequate.
The investigation continued to establish that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian were generally complied with.
These include passport, working permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for controls before the start of employment for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "It was an concern to do this work in the light of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on the checks prior to the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad, were planned to publish the next month.

The 50-year-old, whose films are Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, is currently filming the Indiana Jones Continue The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to get the price named in honor of Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He is my type of man, a great actress of his time, I am really honored."
The independent film prices, known as biphas, are selected by a group of film makers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a Terror Complot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it captured 208 militants for their belonging to cells that had planned a coming attack on an oil plant as well as on clergymans and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest exporters of oil said that one of the cells planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathizers of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an alliance of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion into Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, chaired by a foreign national, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 man with a strong fast entrance force to protect plants after a failure of Al Quaida to the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial declaration, says that 18 of the arrested ones belonged to a cell directed by a "raket expert" who immigrated illegally into the country.
He reports that the military planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
Other 22 of the prisoners claimed to kill clergy and security forces, according to the report.
The government has warned clergymen to do more to stop Saudis, who strive for Iraq to join Al Qaida militia, who want to fight the alliated forces and the U.S.-supported Shizi Muslim government, which is considered to be chanched by the Hardliners under the Sunnitic Saudi.
Al Qaida Milices consider many clergymen in Saudi Arabia to be in collaboration with the authorities in support of the policy of the royal family dominating the government.
The Milices - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia, targeting it to the prowestern Saudi Government - have departed from foreign residential areas, government buildings and installations of the energy sector.
"This was a very great effort of the security forces over the last... five months," a speaker of the Ministry of Interior informed the state television.
The arrests also addressed a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed at advertising for the "takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical sunnitic Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims, which are burned as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested were 32 people who were accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on the Venus could show a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may once have been a pleasant place for life, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship on a circuit route show that the planet is even more similar to a diverted twin of the earth than has been aware.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetary paths, but the Venus of the Sun is a little closer.
billions of years ago, there would have been conditions on Venus that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even be inhabitable today, scientists believe.
But due to the unbremsed carbon dioxide-trebhouse effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotation rate, the Venus took a different course of development.
Today the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is destroyed by hurricane strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space zone of the European Space Agency, which has examined the plants for a year, provide a thrilling view of how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It is clear why the climate on the Venus is so different from that of the earth, while the planets are quite similar otherwise."
"Our new data enables us to create a scenario in which the Venus started billions of years ago like the Earth, possibly with a living environment."
"Enriched uranium" captured by the police
A kilos of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was captured by the Slovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police speaker said that three people were arrested and that the material was checked.
He did not confirm whether it was an enriched uranium, but said that it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Everything still open
My Romey said he does not think it worth a presidential candidate to be consulted by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally declared himself willing to put a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters take questions on video and submit them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday night, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party's debate on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican party that breaks up in the elections next year.
It is not known, just as the producers of CNN who supported the debate with which the candidates to show youtube clips were selected.
However, in the first half-hour of the debate, which was longest dedicated to a single topic, immigration was at the centre.
The issue is one of the most vigorous topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of unequivocal voters to use a electoral disc when they heard things that they liked: the TV institute noticed the tops of consent when the candidates spoke strictly over the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who pushed forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation that he had been incredibly about illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts to have set illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly frankly as questioners asking whether one of the candidates would support a "amnesty" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congress Deputy, and Tom Tancredo, a Congress Deputy in Colorado, managed to follow this issue.
None of the two men have serious possibilities in nomination, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they have fallen earlier and harder than others on the immigration pave.
At least in the field of immigration, candidates share largely the same views: sharper borders, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, together with anxiety about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimise the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic than other topics were addressed.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported weapon restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinking should be considered to be torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani’s view that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to its long-lasting Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was urged whether Jesus would advocate them, he laughed about it and said Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains exceptionally far open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Paul's recent donations and his advocacy storms in the Wednesday debate.
These two are shot up from nothing because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has joined the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victorious message about the size of America and a twin to both wings of the party.
This time the party is split and the result is far unclear.
Labour Party pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another grave to invade; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandale, this is not particularly luxurious.
No edle titles seem to be sold, no politicians of Paris hotel accounts paid, no ex-married teeth were swallowed.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has swallowed donations to the British governing Labour party over more than 650.000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) for four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have been good without the fighting Gordon Brown.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister rejected the demand for a choice, the British intelligence in a dumb way insulted by asserting that the question of opinion had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable, the increasingly crazy representative of the liberal Democrats, it expressed, the once feared Brown of Stalin has developed to Mr. Bean.
The inappropriate salvation of Northern Rock, an attacked bank, showed regulatory weaknesses and bad judgment under shot.
Badly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The tax authorities’ loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative puffs.
A trio of generals in retirement started a rebellion in the upper house of protest against the reduction of military expenditure: to be minister of force forces, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the various donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour's Secretary General (and her former Chairman of fulfillment) has already returned.
Nothing of it means that Brown breaks up unreversible direction of departure.
However, governments can reach a turning point where they feel impossible to rule.
Neither can people trust politicians nor trust politicians, but they usually retain their skepsis when a new troop takes the office.
When it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister improves the situation and he does not need to be there for a long time, this postponement is over: the public service begins to be uncommon; the cabinet ministers start preaching; the press is looking for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and targetless.
In some way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, in contrast to other political leaders, it cannot claim to be a new beast.
As much as he wanted to deny Tony Blair, he was his Lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the taxation documents, for example, are associated with decisions taken by Brown as the Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it wasn't directly involved in Blair's misbehavior - as with the long "Geld for Adels Title" examination of political parties financing - the voters may assume that it was.
Still, Brown's situation is not as bad as it looks
The failures are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, no one died, or was completely screwed.
And the antidote, painful like it may be, is delivering what Brown's naturally stalinist tendency has always promised: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new gesture for political donations is a good example.
The garboeske of Abraham, who compares his donations with his generous gifts, does not wish to accept the public for his welfare.
This may be the case, but the decision was not allowed to do so.
The laws against anonymity for large political donors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, who says he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's main financial operator, who was told about the strange donations in October.
However, Brown is not involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his acquisition in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the infringement of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination through the grassing of a well-known instrument, led to an investigation committee - to complete the measure, by a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, "the teachings to be taken from it" are not very complicated.
When the law is broken, it's a thing for the police.
Besides, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do to find something permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not been busy for six months, and to advance with a comprehensive reform of political parties financing.
This would require the hardliners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a partymate like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The conservatives now have a clear lead in opinion issues; he has two years to recover electorates; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through inevitable justice and solid competence.
Card Hawk
Does the credit crisis put America's credit card market on?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that backflakes are excited.
Now that America's real estate market is violated, the robbery have the country's credit card market in view.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs expect that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of infecting underfined loans spreads to other forms of consumer credits.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in both the bookings and the seasonal rates that measure the share of loans that are not withdrawable or more than 30 days too late each.
The HSBC announced last month that it had taken a $1.4 billion fee collection from its American consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Losses and seams are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quarter rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates may be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to an abrupt case of bankruptcy claims, which, again, represents a large part of the losses of the chain cards; the number of applications (and thus sewing fees) would increase again whether or not the general conditions for creditors would deteriorate.
The industry also reports of solid payment rates showing how much of its debts the consumer pays each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other corners of structured funding.
Dennis Moroney from the TowerGroup, a research company, expects that the volumes of 2007 will finally be 25% higher than last year.
There are definitely direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market: it is more likely that consumers take credit card debts, now that private credits dry out.
However, the card issuers look at the flow of money instead of capital values, therefore falling domestic prices do not necessarily result in a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
You can even be of advantage to the card issuers.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay the hypothesis rates are lower if the real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts under the repayment priorities become more important.
Card issuers can also respond much faster and more flexible than credit providers to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid re-evaluation of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and re-evaluate the loans," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones main financial referent.
Even if a sudden coverage crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of sustainable deviation are significantly more real.
If lower domestic prices and a reduction in the credits of America are pressing into the recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more cruel future.
Continue looking out for these sharks.
British bankers confess guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were to be put before court for their role in the fraudulent system with the former head of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their search on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally incurred innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications funds to conspire with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure had been initiated on January.
But during a hearing before court before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone was guilty of a case of fraud using telecommunications means.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Great Britain in the course of delivery procedures that took two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The accusations originally lodged against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the objective of an investigation by the government in connection with the Enron Niedergang.
The charge against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to eliminate a fraudulent complot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership by Enron, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron companies who contributed to breaking the company into the bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated the value of its participation in the subsidiary to zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had a significant value.
A company under Koper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid copper $250,000 for participation in this company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely represented Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while fastow, copper and others sent about $12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow claimed to be guilty of his role in the Enron Pleite in two points of charge.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is a 6-year prison in Louisiana's federal prison.
Koper is a punishment of three years and one month in a establishment in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on a free foot because of a $1 million deposit, which made it necessary that they lived in the United States in the expectation of the judicial proceedings.
Enron, once the seventh largest company of the nation, broke in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer diminish the billions of debts or make weakening businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollar pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former Chairman Jeffrey Skilling were condemned for their roles in the Enron collapse last year.
Skilling is a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's condemns for conspiracy, fraud and other accusations were invalid after he died last year for heart disease.
Not all the way down in Moscow
The price of a plane of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a rolls-Royce engine and sufficient range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But that's little money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers room for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a golf stream representative.
"But no one of you asks for so many seats because it's for a private family or a company president."
Firer was at the Gulfstream stand last Friday at the millionary exhibition, a four-day orchid from the consumption to be viewed, organized in a decorated exhibition centre at the edge of the city of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built out exhibition stands, hoping to interest Russians newly arrived in everything, from Mahagoni-tailed yachts to diamond-overfilled autogrills that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Firer cautiously took a shiny orange porch on the next stage of the fair.
"This is a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems so overflowed with money like Dallas at its glowing times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic wealth and went to Europe, where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi-Arabian surflies of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the most freely visible outlets in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in gold noise.
elsewhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, attracted to exchange ideas about how to sell high prices on markets like Russia.
(The conference is organised by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billionaires, who own a total of 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth 670 billion dollars together, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert agency here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15.8 percent of the Russians lived under the minimum of existence.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - therefore we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a sale and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweler.
She had visited the trade fair for the first time with the Russian trader of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary and the men are all worth an asset."
While they draw Sunday night in evening clothes through the halls, two real estate makers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, themselves and her clients as millionaires.
"I looked for the cars and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer clothes that she had, like a red tape feter with Joan Rivers.
The trade fair seemed to be aimed primarily at the new areas, the type of brand-conscious Russian purchasers who were ready to stand in the stack several hours to visit a new warehouse that, unsmakably, put Cadillac Escalades, bag knitted from Platinum, Mövenpick Eiskrem, customized biliards, apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddybers next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning what the most expensive and best brand is," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically sat at a fair stand of the Dutch porcelain producer Royal Delft in front of a wall-size imitation of a Rembrandt image of hand-painted blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in climbing climbs."
In fact, the dealers here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years of age are old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-speed logos to the kind of narrow brands with limited numbers that would not be marketed in a trade show.
Yet, several thousand people, whether millionary, missionaries of millionary or simply tourists, pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds said here that he would have sold two $70,000 mattress sets, made of silk, cashmir and cotton, with narrow gold floors.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company equipped high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the grey orange porch for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, said that a company that adapts luxury cars to customers' wishes, had sold three car cooler grills for a rolls-Royce Phantom, which are similar to cedar cedar stripes, for 55.000 dollars each.
He showed a reporter a car copper developed for a Russian casino owner with spears that he had moved over with colored Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a rouletterad.
The cost: $22,000 for a quarter.
"The Russian millionary, who wants to have radiant wheels or a picture of his wife's face of cubic circonium, will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30- or 40-week garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian Millionaires" would not express much exclusiveness at present, given the increase in the real estate prices.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionary, at least on the paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of those than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires were at least able to act as if they were rich at a position operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells according to the British model, which were filled with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his employees had printed 500 000 false banknotes for the millionary trade fair.
Passengers stopped to throw the pillows around, mobile phone photographs, while releasing themselves in the middle of the replacement wealth, being cut by friends, or simply inserting a few million.
"Behold, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionary," said Mr Karryev.
Expected surgery at death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvesting party that Ronald Livingston saw through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched like a hospital car at the white Cape Cod held two doors down at the West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car there.
And then there was another.
"Then I saw the box cart of the doctor's body viewer arrived," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"This was the point when I knew someone had died."
The boards learned that the dead Ms. Olga Arroyo, 41, was a assistant of the director of the Newarch police dezernat.
Now, the investigators try to find out whether she died for a procedure that was carried out by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon, which the police did not identify, and who worked in the house at the West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet identified what caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and hopefully that toxicological investigations whose results could not be available for weeks will help to reveal a mysterious death that sent a grief through the leadership of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo has been a assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known in the department.
"She was loyal, hard working and hardnicking," said Mr McCarthy about Mrs Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former police officer who worked for the alcohol control commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a step daughter.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the ground.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have not informed about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say whether Mrs Castro was asked by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castros' house, where a gloomed rosesmoking stands in the little front garden and a Dalmatin rings behind the house.
A blue fashion labelled "ethyl vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanilla in foods and perfumes - was sitting in the parking lot next to a door that led to the underground.
Two mountain bikes hung from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark for the first time after he had spent 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find himself in the provinceal and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, "You have to pay attention to this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I arrived and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing."
Hopes that the Central Bank will reduce interest rates lead to an increase in world share markets
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after market hopes that the Central Bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest reductions, were strengthened by the vice-president of the U.S. Central Bank.
The share markets increased in London, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Central Bank, said that policy must react "flexible and pragmatic" to the persistent pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down dispersible markets, given signs of emerging credit voltages, said Kohn that the recent turbulencies had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is willing to step in and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital spots in the US markets and possible further interest reductions.
The statements also helped the Wall Street to calm down, given further bad news from the US economy, now as the sale of US immobilies reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulencies were underlined by the announcement by Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their worldwide employees, in a cost reduction measure to compensate for serious losses from their lost bets in the US hypothecary credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these jobs will disappear in London, where the Bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289,40, while the broader S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6.306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's index Dax increased by 2.6 per cent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 per cent.
In the past, the re-evaluation of credit pressure on markets had been underlined after a strong demand for an auction of three-month guarantee funds from the European Central Bank granted to the European Trade Banks had been granted to considerably 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to follow the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank and to eat further funds into the money markets in London, increased as the loan voltages saw the three-month "Libor" Councils to borrow between UK banks with 6.59 percent to their maximum since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England confronts decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to hit the number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral president, is on call at least under this specific title, here to help the chief coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide on it, and because the table of High Morries, the English executive director of business, is gradually filled with applications for national electoral offices, if not even for which in part-time.
Anyone who doesn't get the sixth battle position will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport is doubtless.
It is never easy to get precisely attached to what enables a person to reach the top of his professional branch, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes because of lack of happiness rather than ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgments are needed that are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to rise?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leaders with good conclusions that the business well knows, should be transported.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless he is given the opportunity to swim or to fall.
Of course, numbers have a great impact on decisions, but this is also possible.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a hitter must get regular chances on order if he wants to impress as a one-day cricket player.
Catching the eyes of the choosers is more complicated.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who appears to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and how the wind boils into the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their glance points and hope for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiriya Stadium, only a question of view can be.
The choice could decide the career of both men, or it may make a little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, still fighting to firm himself, who created the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although he points a double hundred against Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion in the course of the current Asgiriya Network Session, will follow their conservative instinct and abdominal feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youth enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is younger than 22 years old, and an excellent balance against rotated balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two Innings in May against West Indians in the test in Lord, his home venue as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection from the electors as Vaughan was healthy to withdraw his position for the next game, seems to have taken the turn from his stroke, which was still obviously in Bombay.
On the other hand, the Essex all-sounder has spectacular joy of life.
He is not impressed by anything on a cricket spot and his attitude on the other hand was brought to the point when he had recently overturned a vehicle with four-wheel drive in an exhibition for England's Sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pick out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from the distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen that?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he boils his average speed with some effect here on the fields, which seems to fit to him and beat with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, the right time to choose another.
Maybe this is the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not stand well, if, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus charges of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Bagdad yesterday, with a stream of distributors whose funds or visas have run out, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even returned to fight the rebels they had disappeared from their homes.
At Mansour Bus Station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operated with refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned in private transportation.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Bagdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunnitian doctor.
"I came back today, because of what I saw in television and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Bagdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, as regards the skiitenmilices of the militant clergy Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered to revert his powers at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old scholar from the most important sinus part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime of Iraq is not allowed to work.
His Shiitic neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia supported by the United States contributed to expulsion of Al-Qaida from their bastion in the west of the capital, and forced him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Sunnitic and Shiitic tribe who had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in the north of Bagdad by an attack with hand granates after he had invited his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He was coming back to fight.
"Two days ago some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and those of my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been attracted by the increasing peace in the capital since the U.S. troops increase and the growth of local "groups affected citizens" which armed and in cooperation with the American military defend their city districts.
But more was said to have been forced home by visa problems and decorative funds in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqers had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shitian Prime Minister, requested the Syrian Government to impose visa restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people have probably fled from the sectary death squadrons in the country.
"We went well until Al-Maliki visited Syria, and the government urged the Iraqi people to no longer give a visa to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunnitic pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left."
A part of the reason for the decline in violence is that Sunnites were disposed of from Shitian residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will shine sectary tensions again and there will be conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest state is leading in vocational training and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in a field of education, the Saarland expresses the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I explained the 50th time of yesterday to a non-sarland that we are not French" - this slogan posters the smallest state self-ironically to its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which is located in the educational monitor of the Institute of the German economy Cologne (IW).
Thus, the universities already cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Until today, students here can complete their study with a double or even three-fold diploma.
Accordingly, the share of foreign students is 15.6 per cent.
However, the country children also bring the Saarland into an over-average number to the universities - many of them without a graduation at the gym.
"In Saarland you are using the vocational education system," says Axel Plonnecke, educational expert at the IW.
More than every fifth youth acquires his training permit at a vocational school, thus Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combined opportunities of vocational and academic training are also strongly expanded.
Measured by the population number, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering fields.
"In the general educational schools, we have started some reforms after the first Pisa study," says a speaker of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government initiated national comparative tests.
In order to start learning the children earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model, which now also copies other federal countries.
If the performance of the students is sustainablely improved, future comparative studies will only show.
At Pisa in 2003, the proportion of risk pupils decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as much as other federal countries.
The Bayern's better count.
And for the disturbance of the Saarland, foreign language knowledge at Pisa is not measured - in this area you could otherwise point.
Because the language of the neighbours is required in gymnasia - even if the Saarland are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks are almost different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets the time meters back in the South American country for half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a jokefigure.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela announced, a new law states that the clocks are adjusted to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American State a time zone that is not in any other country of the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, inter alia, that the United States of the World would have set up the breakdown in time zones for full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced the breakdown of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia on Wednesday (local time) due to a hostage business.
The left-nationalist said, as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe remains President of Colombia, he will not enter relations to the Head of State or to the Colombian Government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who drives a constitutional reform that the citizens of Allandes must vote on on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was the decision of Uribes to withdraw Chávez from the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, which was about the release of hostages.
Uribe criticized Venezuela on Sunday with his decision to "spuck a face", Chávez.
In Spain, Chávez is also in all the mouths.
A new mobile rington provides for Furoree in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (Why you don't think the mouth) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
On the recent Ibero-American summit, Spain's King Juan Carlos spoke to him, who had been arrogant on the constant intercurrence of the left-popularist and rided over his mouth.
Deutschen threatens 2007 Lohnminus
Despite the strong economy, German employees are threatening a real wage loss this year.
Experts called a whole group of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees could really calculate less on the pay account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"It is the case of the modest development of wages, VAT increases and prices in food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economy Research of the "Image".
New burdens could also arise from unemployment insurance to workers.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent for the annual change in the current situation is right and reasonable.
However, if the Federal Agency for Labour may not have to come into disturbance again to ask for loans or grants to the Federal Federation, the SPD politicians were quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products has operated at the highest level for 13 years.
Total prices increased by 3.0 per cent in the annual comparison.
Venus is the holdish twin of the earth
Despite its enemy atmosphere in the earth, Venus Express has been more similar than yet thought: the European space zone "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind turbulence to Poland, as it appears on the earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have assumed that it's flashing on the Venus.
Now the European Sonde "Venus Express" has demonstrated - she felt electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lightning on the Venus shoots at a height of about 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the Scientific Magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory" flashes have caused life on the earth to arise: weather should have stimulated reactions that led to the formation of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not so on the Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, on the surface of the Venus there is hardly anything vivid: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denseer than on the earth, it sometimes reigns temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil willingness of the earth, but it is a twilling," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has encountered such a different development, is the basic issue of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, since since the beginning of the nineties, no more ason was on the way to explore this planet.
The latest research results now presented in several "Natures" articles are not just underlined by the researchers in view of the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system.
"They also show that the commonness of our neighbouring planet with the earth is greater than first accepted," the Esa declares.
Thus, the researchers, besides the already known spine wind at the North Pole, also found a cloud belt on the South Pole, which turns even much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air flows on the earth's winter hemisphere, writes a research team about Giuseppe Piccioni by the Italian istituto di Astrophisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second-thinned planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12100 kilometers.
The planet, also called morning or evening stars, creats around the sun in nearly 225 days.
But he turns much slower around himself: a Venus day takes 243 earth days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds the earth, scientists assume that both planets have been created under very similar conditions.
On both, water that remained on the earth in oceans was collected, but in Venus was lost into space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbonate stones, it is most of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Kühler defends Merkel meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands a end of the party dispute for the reception of Dalai Lama at the office of office.
Indirect, he criticized the SPD for her attacks on the mayor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's appearance and has called for the great coalition to end the dispute to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the outer world in this question a split nation," said Köhler to the trade sheet.
At the same time, Köhler signaled understanding for the reception of Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany must maintain sensible balances in foreign policy, stressed the Federal President, but took Merkel in protection from the punishment, maintaining a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not taken a distance from the traditional one-China policy.
That knows China too," said Köhler.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had shown indirect discouragement over the reception of Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from series of the Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's "shaw window policy" in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas at the office of office, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only invited the German financial minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of both countries' foreign ministers, according to the SPIEGEL information.
China's Head of Government, Wen Jiabao, has now invited Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge the reception of Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China rejects it when European politicians in official function receive the religious leader of Tibetans, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The deeds and words of Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other Provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns against crowns like in France
Road battles with police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schueble warns against crwalls as in France.
It was necessary to do everything so that social dissatisfaction in Germany could not be released into violence on the road, the Federal Minister demanded.
Barrikaden burned, Randaliers shot on the police with scratch flints: After the heavy youth crabs in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schueble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We need to be careful that we do not also build up social explosives and eliminate in violence.
We need to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hannover.
Not every young person can handle the rapid change in social reality.
Federal, countries and municipalities have already worked with the emphasis to eliminate problems, said Schueble.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit up to the Islamic Conference, this already shows first success."
However, it should be too early for warning.
Schäuble at the same time pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German forests as in France.
In northern forests of Paris, young people in the past nights had delivered heavy road slaughters with the police.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
However, greater integration efforts by the Federal Government required the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the crucibles in France, colat warned against "needing effects".
The situation in Germany is not as brisant as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people with a migration background under 25 years of age was "excessively high".
In particular, more training spaces must be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We have to give youths a perspective."
The president of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "a social control is taking place in the families".
In addition, many youths with migration background did not want to destroy what their parents had built up here.
Colat reminded me, "But we still have to be careful."
You must give youths "a quick opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, it remained quiet in the night in the Pariser Vorort Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in use, a helicopter was overflowing the area.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning wastehouses and cars.
Since the past, an offer of about 1,000 security forces has provided peace.
The police will intervene as long as it was necessary, interior minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the front city.
In the evening on Tuesday, at Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 policemen had been injured.
Consequently, the disturbances on Toulouse were overcome.
The Krawalls inflammed at an accident in transport, where two young people died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the prosecutor, the police are not guilty of the death of the youths.
In the Empire of Angela Wolke
The lawyer’s remote appearance documents that the coalition is at the end - and that it is no longer expected of herself.
In what country does this Federal Chancellor actually live in?
After her unfortunate appearance in the Federal Day General debate, which was worsening and content arm, it must be said: not here - not in the country that would eventually have to be ruled by it.
The claim that they should focus too much on foreign policy has rejected Angela Merkel with an indignant sentence.
It was provincial, she said and first showed that she wouldn't understand what the critics were about.
In the Federal Day, it documented how much to be claimed for everyone.
There was no specific interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Cloud presented itself: a declined politician who flew into foreign policy and stays there in an unfair way.
For example, climate protection: in this respect, it does not praise itself for the decisions of Holyndamm, but does not say how to achieve the climate targets here.
Indeed, the self-advocacy - so much unreasonableness would have failed the CDU chief two years ago.
Now she's climbing to the flesh that the rise comes to the people.
So she damages her image as a practitioner, which solves the problems rather than speaking the world beautifully.
But in the empire of Angela Wolke, internal policy problems are a peripheral appearance.
Children's poverty and the anxiety of the low earners?
She's left a few bits.
It is significant how often she promises when it comes to the child’s addiction.
Three runs need Merkel there to bring out a half straight sentence.
She's stumbled as on foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack department
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidency candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are offering a hard battle exchange - and now they need to fear an external candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already exposed to the first topic.
He has made New York a "a refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney contradicts Rudy Giuliani.
This one answers with serious claims: "I would say that his own house was a port for Illegale", responds Giuliani and insists the former governor of Massachusetts to have employed private immigrants without papers.
The candidates are blown to attack: Since the Republican base continues to have no clear favourites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN especially to discredit their opponents.
The self-rotated 30 seconds videos that Internet users have sent through YouTube are hardly more than labels.
"With this kind of isolationism we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain rejects his contradictor Ron Paul, who as the only one in the round demands an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also strongly read the Levites from Vietnam-Veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", a interrogation method that simulates drinking as a torture.
However, the reactions of the Hall Public in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that the major topics of the campaign are beyond the Iraq war and torture debates.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium will welcome.
The weaknesses of the two favorites are shown once more.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney crushing and serves in front of the base and the television public for the fact that he was still one of the abortion advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into the slinger when he is considered to be asked about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules in civilians for the first time
One day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistanian powerholder Musharraf has been defended as President.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was defended on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
The Pakistan TV transferred the ceremony live in the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and to act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had delivered his office as army chief to his familiar Ashfaq Kiyani and thus bowed international pressure especially from the United States.
Eight years after his conquest in an unblooded militaryputch, the former general is now reigning as a civil head.
With his resignation as the chief commander of the forces, Musharraf had met a core challenge of opposition and west.
Another key demand is the end of the exceptional condition that Musharraf had attached on 3 November.
Soon after his defense, Musharraf will cancel the exceptional state according to General Attorney Malik Muhammad Qayyum and thus meet another demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the Country, which Musharraf had occupied, after the admission of the exception with him at the beginning of November, had rejected all contradictions against the contradictory reconciliation of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
In the northern region of the Nord-Waziristan, five soldiers were killed and four more injured at an attack on a military convoy.
According to one army speaker, the bomb exploded on a road near the border to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany's Super Group of the Sevenths plays again: The three band members of Harmonia took their consoles again at a concert in Berlin.
For the Revival, a cut from her great time "Life 1974" appears.
They were far more famous in abroad at that time.
The appealed sensation will then take place in the form of three men set at the evening table.
Everyone has his box in front of himself, his cable and especially his buttons.
Dieter Moebius thront in the bloody white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Links flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed from the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, focused on the console.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it adds accidentally to a traditional piece of music.
That does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
That the band harmonia is again musiced, has made some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What can be revealed here: Targeted demands showed that although the name swarmed through collective pop memory, but no longer so sustainable to miss this band for 32 years painfully.
But why should the German not also be allowed to celebrate his living legends from the 1970s?
Most of what is called misleading Krautrock, in England and America was always more true than in their own country.
When the musical economy gave the survivors of the Cologne Group Can the Echo Prize for Lifework in 2003, it was seen in the hall in questioning German pope views.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and New in Laudatio, the admiration could not limit.
In concerts, Michael Rother later hocked at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the stage like an old companion.
The problem of ignorement at home and the V-declaration in the stranger is one.
The memory is already overloaded with Harmonia because the trio existed only two years and also developed a much lower power than they were subsequently assigned by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
First played in the cellar under the Berlin scuba.
Afterwards, in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label that the church entertained.
Rother had shortly helped at power plant and then played a call as a guitarist at New!, perhaps the most radical German group at that time.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians to the exile to Forst in the Weserbergland.
There, in the ancient Weserhof, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as city refugees.
Less ideologically than in the municipality of I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague as a child girl.
It's in a high-speed artist's place.
It appears that in the locker waste there was also a mark of the song association of Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art.
Some of them held Harmony.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because so left and modest the music also sounded, the band suffered material distress.
The collection of rice did not serve solely in self-detecting.
The CD "Life 1974" now appeared was cut with a concert in Griesem, before a 50-headed record ballis, as someone thinks to remember.
From Rother then the desire to force harmonia and sometimes practice.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral claim.
The band explained its separation in 1975.
Redher landed in Esoterian sphere and secured his existence with albums like "Flaming hearts".
Cluster has been revived in the eighties and has been more successful since then than it was Harmonia ever.
The Grasser live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
This platenfirma Grönland has the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as its own German contribution to living music.
New! was already excavated like Roedelius Solowork.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures in the world.
Publicly subsidised, under the festival of Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the British, old punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There's also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
With which the entire bandwidth of the impact of the Krautrock would be circulated to the following pop music.
The space of the supergroup is filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence sweats with the most separate sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with harmonia in the farmhouse.
The legend formation serves projections of other black and white photos of our cabled devices.
Before that, the three veterans are reconsidered with the improvisation.
No more by climbing microphones to the organ and to the sleeves to unlock the instruments via self-charged power devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technically deep tuftler.
This does not change the choir of the house.
Under the direction of Barbara Morning Star, sound clouds are hooped and wiped and in a beautiful place with emphase "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never Rock.
The roots were sought less in blues than in music high schools (Can), technologies (powerwork) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (clusters).
Whoever calls here "68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia is not allowed to get out of it now.
Still the most self-conscious is thoroughly overlooked on the stage.
Where does music begin and when does it stop?
This can rob the nerves or sharply moments of great luck.
Richard Gere is simply not cynic enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Mörderian Peace" two films are dealing with the Balkan war again.
But both do not convince.
Either the concepts put too much on action and balls or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: Although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark behindland of the Bosnia war, the actress Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had last lost the most beautiful man of the eighty years because too many non-significant roles in charity films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism exaggerated one's desire to look forward to.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - If the hunter becomes hunting" (Why does film titles have to be always as long today and we may be like locate?) maybe.
He delivers a marvelous eye-blowing representation: In fact, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been made of Gere if the fate and the film industry would not be so gracious: a man who has his best time behind himself, but who has preserved itself as a ruin-like monument of his decline, even considerable remains of the first charm.
But despite this trompet, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production of "Morderian Peace", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Mörderian Peace" you can make a short process: The film is a film of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serbian from cosovaric heck protectors, and one is in love with them.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not once represented as the sole root of all evils here, the television film loses too quickly in ballers and action.
There remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without motorway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored for example, why there has actually never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reports that open up to discover the Serbian superwar criminal "the fuchs" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another writer (both in staff union Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the Storys are like a bitch: both times small teams go into the forest to accomplish something that the military can't, and both times it's going to be a trip into the madness.
One of the reasons for failure of "The Hunting Party" is that you don't just let Simon Hunt be the deceased cynics with heart when it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must inspire him another romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnia.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the bach when the reporters in the last five minutes in the time racing process have succeeded in what Nato, CIA and all the world's head-payers have not done in five years: the war criminals catch and leave the Muslim Bosniaans to just revenge.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crime against Kinology.
The film has a deep human concern.
He wants to suggest that Karadzic and Mladic are still free to run, and he suspects the Americans and the French (this should be exceptionally agreed) to not excessively intensive persecution due to secret political agreements.
But the good common and the evil are sometimes similar to one's familiar with a famous Brecht poem.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the dictator's work table: "I feel sorry to see the swollen stomachs, inspiring: how hard it is to be evil."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have precisely such threshold heads, but suggested how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper has reported that all Iraq films were Hollywood's big flows.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film yet.
Almost always: When a star runs around on the crises or mine fields in the world, then something like "Rangoon" comes out with Patricia Arquette, "besides all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprico.
Perhaps all the conflicts are just too close in time.
It had to be decades before Hollywood could turn a good film on the Holocaust with "Schindler's List".
Some films are likely to be mature - the now Classic Vietnam works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps we know today, where every mass murder in real time comes home on equally two screens, too simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the sculptors the uncertainty that it takes to tell good stories.
"Being or nonsense" or "The Great Diktator" has finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you can't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the sarcastic-danced artist's view of Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When his historical novel "Lemprières dictionary" and the Balkan war was questioned, he replied: "It is only because some things never change.
Great cities will always be terrible dangerous, people will always be murdered in a cruel manner and always will rule war in Yugoslavia."
Critic for Olympia Dismissal harvested by Beast
The decline of the mayor from Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has led to severe criticism in politics and economics.
Many want to continue to fight for the games at the water.
However, realism admonishes from the beast in assessing the opportunities.
On Wednesday, the principal director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a dismissal as "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently evolved as great motivation forces in the city as the Olympiaide.
"Without this objective, the sport policy turn could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to finish the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "a change in timeline".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with previous statements that the Olympia ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympia application, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," said by Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the early December decision of the Sports Federation on an application of Munich for winter games 2018.
"This preference means for us that we will not have realistic chances in the period that we have planned until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream is not dreamed for all time, said of beast.
The Hamburg Sportbund (HSB) regreted the statements of Beusts.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build a chance by being hedged the plans at that time," said HSB President Günter Plot on Wednesday.
A refusal to apply is also contrary to the statement of the Senate Head at the time of receiving a full meeting of the General German High School Sports Association.
There, by Beust, the application of Hamburg for the university 2015 "not as a replacement" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The university sports association had only been nominated as a candidate city last week of Hamburg.
The SPD citizenship fraction proposed the Senate not to have used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because he has set on the map Olympia and hatched the housing building," said the SPD member Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Little Grasbrook has always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later use of living, the CDU has set one side to the "Event Factor".
The application for the Olympic Summer Games in 2012 had a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed at Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Who connects the terms Sweden and wooden chest, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Isn't it?
Currently, in Sweden, fabrised wooden boxes throw dark shadows on Warhol's worklist.
Most of the four and ninety-four brillo boxes listed there from "Type Stockholm" are fakes.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expresse" has doubted the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes of 1968, internal research at the Moderna Museum in Stockholm now comes to an encouraging result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén the Moderna Museum has made as a gift in 1995, are copies - and probably the majority of about a hundred other Bridge-boxes from "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is neglected, a confusing pronunciation of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboards of the soap powder "Brillo".
A exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museum in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - made hundreds of Brillo boxes from paperboard: These (for cost reasons) came not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartonage factory.
It was not artworks, it was their models, only exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted the permission to produce a few brillo-holz kists in Sweden, which were not issued in the Moderna Museum in 1968.
Time witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes that then have entered into the art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have earned over $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been around a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden in 1968 and had been issued, which then left Warhol to him.
In fact, Hultén's 105 boxes were only produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol was dead for three years at that time.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at Moderna Museet, has also studied three of the six museum-owned Brillo-boxes of Swedish private possession, of which two were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press teams were first founded and smuggled, then white oil was placed with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of the copies from 1990 shows that the colour has been directed on the press plate with a painting roll without grounding - and it is not oil- but acrylic colour.
"These boxes were not authorized by artists and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Moderna Museum, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Moderna Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
In July, the Authentication Board has voluntarily announced the "severe charges" raised in matters of the soap powder boxes.
But since then, there has been unreasonable silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebelling soldiers who were disposed of in a hotel in Manila and demanded the crash of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not be responsible for blood pouring, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who predicted the President corruption and electoral fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government-breaking soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under tear gas.
The about two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them stood before court on Thursday because of a failure of a punishment trial in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to suddenly stop with about 30 sympathisers.
The military politicians who were actually to guard him were evident to him and joined his mautation.
They entered the Peninsula hotel and called for the crash by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops locked the district around the best hotel.
The President called on an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
The National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"The people have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the march soon.
For Friday, government critics had called for great demonstrations against the President.
Their government has been overshadowed by corruption claims for months.
Manila's financial district was already in 2003 the main scene of the attempted meutery of around 200 military members against Arroyo.
The rebellion failed after nearly 24 hours of refusal to join the army.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven punish trials against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes large shareholder at Versatel
The United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
You now hold 20.05 percent of the capital.
An overtake had been speculated before.
It is open to the option to increase the proportion of versatiles.
The step is to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, the United Internet informed.
Previously on Wednesday, the Berenberg Bank had already raised its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.

In the context of an increase in capital, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares of EUR 106.4 million.
5.15 million shares of them bought the United Internet for EUR 31.4 million.
In addition, the companies have received discussions on marketing cooperatives for DSL and mobile products.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet Speaker.
The two companies have founded the joint venture MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
First, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of over ten percent of Freenet and do not use their right to take over 18,49 percent of Freenet, the United Internet informed on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept open all the options, particularly to continue to increase participation in Freenet AG.
Interviews between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were closed in mid-November.
The long-term and difficult-lookable poker around Freenet for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had 2.9 million mobile customers and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers at the end of the third quarter.
The holding of the United Internet and Drillisch held directly 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
Now, it had been agreed that Drillian would bring about four percent more.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of Vatas' investment company had already been agreed in August.
