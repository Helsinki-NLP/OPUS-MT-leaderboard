DFB-Chef Grindel does not see a basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel is currently not looking at a basis for returning from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on getting into the conversation once, that one also talks to him about why he seemed to have felt something like that in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Image Time".
Despite the now monthly debate on the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan, he regrets the withdrawal of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have enjoyed if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed to some point that this would be the way," said Grindel.
In July, the 29-year-old had declared his withdrawal from the DFB team and also justified that he had not defended him against racist oppositions during the WM.
The DFB-Chef repeated his criticism to Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Federal Trainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from the football so that if "you leave a team or change an association, you talk about it with his coach and I find it bad that this conversation has not been done so far."
Linz: Garden cabinet in Screberg-Artent-Singling burnt
At 14.13 a.m., the Linz occupational fire was alarmed to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line leads directly over the shreberg type settlement, danger was delayed.
The occupational fire force expressed and found the cabin in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically to the gate and fireproofs to the necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden cabin, he had put on a battery to shop at lunch.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any case, according to firearms, the charger was located in the field of the largest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has to be determined, as is the cause of the fire.
However, he is likely to be considerable, because the owner had many pieces of collector in his garden cabinet.
Anxiety mother fights: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What has Lindsay Lohan just driven to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to remove the children from a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has lived herself, as she seems to want a family in Moscow to depart from the children.
This reports the U.S. portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial average of the stream.
Here you can see "To be lucky kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows how Lohan gets out of a car and goes to a potential homeless family that she wants to have made as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees just before the actress, Lohan is following the parents and her children.
It advocates adults to pursue children's sales.
For all that, she does not provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world is looking at this," Lohan is hearing in the video how she continues to pursue the family along the street.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some time, however, it seems that the angry mother is enough.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses an ear fee.
Under tears, the actress delights how shocked she is - and she keeps her wang.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The Sonde "Hayabusa2" started in Japan in December 2014.
She is supposed to approach the asteroid Ryugu so much that she can eye material from its surface and bring it to the earth.
The "Mascot" lander will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: The number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of the strength of 7.5 and then Tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 death victims are mentioned.
The number of victims could continue to increase.
The rescue teams have not yet been encountered in the desolated and cut off from the outer world.
Elon Musk goes back as Head of Tesla Supervisory Board
At the beginning, there was a twitter.
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk provided an alarm at the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal from the Eletro-autobuilder.
The US exchange oversight accused him of fraud, but now both agreed.
Tesla and Musk must pay, and the Tesla-Chef will withdraw from the Board of Supervisors, but may remain chairman.
Party day of the British Conservatives
Sharp guard - the party day of Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a force struggle.
On the day of the party, foreign policy, trade and development policy will be addressed, but the four-day conference will be overestimated by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit Hardlins, on the front of the Ex-President Boris Johnson.
Reference for a new State Name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state on the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been fighting about these name duplicates for years.
Now they agreed.
The state of Macedonia is supposed to be the name of North Macedonia in the future and votes about it this Sunday - if it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against judicial populations Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("Not") means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood is divided in the country.
Thousands went to the street in several cities to protest against the legal population Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump of Brazil" is an anti-system candidate and is therefore in front of the surveys.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Worker Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" upgrading lasts longer than planned
"The Diesel-Taskforce is still there," said Head of Development Peter Mertens to the industry magazine "Automobile Week".
In December 2017, the arrested and admitted Audi-Chef Rupert Stadler announced that the Taskforce would soon be dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/drive combinations are expected to be checked," he said then.
Mertens now said: "In the beginning of July, we have reached an important stage goal in the development of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel candal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the autobuilder has made "great organisational changes" so that such a scandal never occurs again.
The VW Supervisory Board had made a decision on the future of Stadler on Friday and wanted to continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The detection authorities shall propose that the Audi-Chef have authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust values after announcement of the exhaust fraud plants.
He knew of the manipulations, or he consciously ignored them.
At present, sales manager Bram Schot is directing the company as Commissioner.
Due to the change to the new standard of exhaust and consumption tests WLTP, there are production failures at Audi, said the "Heilbronn's voice".
In principle, he sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment itself is difficult," he said.
Scots put on electrical mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives to re-electuring - Lahm is intended to enter the DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to return to the office as President of DFB in the next year, despite the criticism of his person after the WM out and the Özil Affair.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it is," said Grindel as a guest on the early Sunday morning in the "Current Sports Studio" of the ZDF.
You have to try again and again, I'll do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In its own words, the Chief of the Association would find it "wonderful" if he did not have "contribution to the future project" after the grant for the football EM in 2024.
Grindel has been head of association since April 2016 as a successor of Wolfgang Niersbach crashed over the summer march affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first complete term of three years.
The next vote will take place on the DFB Birthday on 27 September 2019.
The future EM-Chef Organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB presidency according to Grindel.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that he was also consulted in this role in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, heartfeltly invited to provide his experience in sports issues," said Grindel.
To speculation whether lame could become his successor as a DFB-Chef, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair around the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player should become a DFB's integration message in the future without a migration background.
At present, this office of the born Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is one without a migration background that clearly influences society and football and says, "the topic is important, then we have to take care of," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the spot where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Decrease correctly with half-clever scale
I've had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat.
Musculoskeletal and bone mass can also show it.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it is rather for the worsen.
Doesn't he tell me if I've replaced fat with muscles?

Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
The Turkish President Reep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with his three-day state visit, among other things with Kanzlerin Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Critique to Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German Government to deliver the Golden Movement adherents to Germany and to act against Kurdish Separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathisers of the PKK or gold movement to shake our citizens and harm German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the Kölner Innenstadt was partly locked.
Several thousands of policemen were in use - among them also sharp protectors.
The Islamic Association Ditib is in criticism because it is considered to be an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buh calls and horror
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have been engaged at a joint concert in the New York Central Park for more commitment to combating poverty and disease.
"Engaged you, wherever you can only," Mendes said at the festival in the night to Sunday before about 60.0000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I'm sweating, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and Aid Organisations, showed themselves in the multi-hour spectacle on the stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a horror second when many observers thought the sound of a falling metal locker for shots, got scared and tried to flee.
Soon there was panic, people ran into each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people from the stage.
"Nobody's trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert there was free of charge on the Internet, like every year.
Anyone who wanted to ride the Internet had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were celebrations and applause calls from the audience for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
Although this was the case together with his democratic colleague, Chris Coons, on the stage for more equality of men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the Jurisdiction Committee of the US Senate for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court and thus put many women in the head.
At least three women have raised abuse claims until the attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which rejects it.
Flake demanded an FBI investigation of the claims after two women, according to their own information, faced sexual offences on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can also like to meet with me at any time in a elevator," Flake now said at the concert in New York about the crowd of spectators.
Press freedom: Federal Government defends the journalist's outcast
State speaker Steffen Seibert has defended the draft of a journalist from the press conference of Kanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) and the Turkish President Reep Tayip Erdoğan.
The Turkish journalist, who lived in Hamburg, moved a T-shirt with the Turkish and German title "Freedom for Journalists" and went to the first row.
The T-shirt, hadn't been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disturbance in the course of the press conference.
The journalist's action has caused a strong disturbance, which is not acceptable.
He's been making people's guards bring out the man.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellor Office.
This applies completely irrespective of whether it is a legitimate matter or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are claimed to have spionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the fetholah gold movement.
The Turkish leadership makes the movement responsible for the failed punish trial on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatening decades of prison.
Foreign journalists are also not sure before the Turkish authorities: first early September, Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Lastly, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had provided for oversight.
They came free and could return to Germany, but in Turkey there are still processes against the two.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-looking he usually knows his fans: Florian David Fitz.
There you have to look at: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actress was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas night" produced by the NDR is known for moisturising conversations at the Theke of the Hamburg Harbour Kneipe "Schellfischposten".
Ina Müller, fashioner insists on some beer, some wines or even more high-percent drinks to unlock the mood and tongue.
Not a few promises also drink courageously for the obligatory vocal deposits.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actress Florian David Fitz is known from films like "man's hearts", "Terror - Your judgment" or "The jokest day".
The coiner did not get the excursion to the high north at all.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely naked on it, the eyes are only two small clothes.
The bed-Selfie shows a completely excited Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cater.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not very seriously - findings that he now gained: "Regel one: does NOT go to Ina's night.
Rule two: never drink the black sauce.
And syringe.
And the round egg liquor, which ina swept at half three, also let go.
Alcohol consumption is indeed written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans just posted a few tips to combat the proliferation.
They were sufficient of instantaneous brewers, fish broths or - probably the most targetive - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the usually attractive cinema.
As Ina Müller has survived the night's shipping situation, it is not known until now.
However, since she has moderated the TV-Space at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly tested...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and disracy
The entrance in the 36 kilometers long railroad in the Red Cable Land in Treysa presents itself hardly detectable and devastatable.
Recipes against grassing vandalism are searched, but solutions are hardly seen.
Sharpening, cigarette chickens, waste and unrate, demolised waste emulsions and in the meantime demonstrated signs - so since the length of the entrance with seat group to the wheelway on the Haaße hill in Treysa.
A more than unfavourable view for the pre-view object Railway Road in the Red Ticket Land.
The topic concerns members of the ADFC local group of Schwalmstadt, but also others for a long time, according to the Wheel Traffic Officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the Wheel Traffic Advisory Board.
A solution has not yet been given.
The proposals were sufficient from the transfer of the seat group to the regular disposal of waste containers and the cleaning of the surfaces at the entrance site.
"I think the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says deserthagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that he has also brought the topic into the local council.
Not only the waste drives bicycles and residents around - the seat group is regular meeting point on weekends to celebrate.
It is not only often a matter of sound, the layers are also destroyed: foams ripped out of the earth, waste moulds demolated, plates knitted, seating furniture decorated.
Volunteers had already cleaned up more frequently, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the speaking drops on the hot stone.
You're angry that the Rastplatz on the bike road is in Treysa Meeting Point for Supplage.
"With the entire bike path, this is clearly the focus of the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling officer, who is now also taking care of the new cycling site in goathain, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it becomes really expensive."
Another idea is a video monitoring on the hill: "Perhaps this may make the threshold significantly higher to understand on common input.
This would, however, predict that then a police strap will pass over.
In principle, desert gardens want to develop the hate hill.
He must be more attractive.
The frequency of the cycling route so far can be very satisfactory.
The tourist marketing is still explorable.
Our bike route is very high-quality compared to others in Germany," said ADFC members.
As an extremely critical hazard point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the ashe red road in Treysa.
There's no abbie track on the hate hills.
Regular traffic may cause bicycles to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of traffic," she explains.
This would not be a problem for sports drivers, but well for older people and especially for children.
Music Competition at the Cultural Train Station: The "Cow of Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call for music competition was a success, creative, and in one another.
"D to offer a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the city's part-offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "in the sympathic Hiltruper family with eyebrows", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family with each other with coffee and cake from the honorary officials of the Culture Station.
Seven formations arrived, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "helptruper star colors", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the children's garden of Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Blacks.
This contest, said District Citizen Joachim Schmidt, was a new one.
We have not yet experienced that in other parts of the city.
What did the texts look connected with?
At the places, the Hiltruper Sea and the market alle were particularly often mentioned.
Rolf Himmig shortened the salon in his sleek song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Culture Railway Station was also appreciated.
It was always about the experience of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the artists or instructions on her creation.
Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitars.
From Tontechniker Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew to report that he recently occurred in Ludwigshafen - at a major event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all the way on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," said Franke.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomie.
Nevertheless, for the favorites of the jury there was something special - so that others can hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can take a song: He with his Hiltrup battle, who especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lumerland Rudel": "a very beautiful appearance" with ten children and two teachers on guitars and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everybody, the children came back to the final, and even without electronic support, they sounded "truely good," as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, accessibility of the melody and recognising value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Western Falish School for Music, Andreas Klomfat von KvG-Gymnasium, and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association, as well as Jan Kaven, Chairman of the City Part Offensive.
The city participants had launched the event on the basis of their ten years of existence.
She appreciated the event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams who sit in front of each other.
For each page there is a screen, in which there are four cards with keywords that - the old trick with the red slide - can be decorated only when you put it in.
Thus it is ensured that the opposite can not read anything by mistake.
On the maps, for example, it is to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Second window.
3. Cube.
Fourth party.
These are the terms that are to be encrypted in the future.
For it is not to be guessed here the terms, but codes.
Switching one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that may be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" it is not supposed to be guessed the terms behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should, in this order and in this example, describe the terms "dices", "fast" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as possible, because this will win the party if he succeeds twice to knock the code.
So the encryptor notes and reads loudly: "Worf" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to the festival; of course, there would also be something like "Party" possible and "Prag" because he has watched at school and knows the window crash there.
This is how round for round, team for team.
Although you don't know the concepts of the opposite, it can be better aligned with any point that the encryptor gives there.
So, as mysterious as possible, but not to turn away, the rescriptions should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptical to "Decrypto" is, unfortunately, the ruler.
The participants are likely to have to study it very long and detailed until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever has first put off will be fascinating how much feeling is in this insightful game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as decisive as predecessors and genre prrimus "codenames", which also puts an agent theme on a game less words but is much better to play in small groups.
And who is only about ratification and not about victories, he can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and distresses guests in the Kneipe
A 48-year-old man occupied the police inspection of Kulmbach twice in the night from Saturday on Sunday.
He first showed Hitler’s greeting in the upper city of a passing police strip, and later he also fell in a knee in the upper city when he was disturbing other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized the awarded reference by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection of Kulmbach in the prison cell.
In the narrower state, he must also be responsible for criminal offences due to the use of marks of non-constitutional organisations.
Operation Pressy was home to the shoe blocks
The railway operation in Pressig was the turning disc in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"If buffers knocked on buffer, they heard it in very pressy," George Dinkel recalls, who archives the history of the place and the station.
No one did that.
There the brakes were silent, and the wagons were knocked.
That was just a pure railway.
Statements that are picturesque for Dinkels Home Pressy.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steil ramp mountain line to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 metres, has its hill point in Steinbach on the forest.
In order to handle this, earlier train and shoe blocks were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bayerian landday approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotives, teacher workshops, bicycle and railway engineering.
"The heartpiece was the rotary disc, which had a diameter of 18 metres after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional railways.
The 1968 Bamberg, pressed by the station (BW) Pressy, was also operated for the sideways Pressig - Tetau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - North Half.
On 15 July 1950, the "volksblad" reported a staff stock of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electricalization of the route in 1939 already minimised the need for train and shoe blocks.
From 1977 they were only used in freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10 000 weighings were classified in the month.
In 1982, parts of the operation were cancelled, 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not seen a better use of the location, including in puncto freight transport".
On Pentecosts in 1989, Nürnberg's Train Directorate celebrated a pompous railway stations festival in Pressig at the anniversary "50 years of electricization Nürnberg - Saalfeld".
"There were ten thousand enthusiastic viewers here," George Dinkel recalls.
Just a little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were deducted, the ranking station Pressig was history.
"The Rangierer and Hemmschohleger did the most difficult work in train traffic," says Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the station Pressig-Rothenkirchen has led to the reverse of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are found here in the inflictedPlus article.
Kerber with entrance success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siemund have reached the second round at the tennis tour in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings thirds is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanier Carla Suárez Navarro.
Shemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian set at number 13.
The swimming pool now gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
In the series "Art and pleasure" a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach in the weekend.
With great enlightenment, organisers and visitors registered the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windplay Performance" was opened in the outdoor area of the property Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Round around Walberla" in the series "Art and Enjoy".
This opened her palaces in the 15th year.
The fascination of the exhibition was shown by a great visitor's speech.
21 copies of 20 artists are now visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the vernissage.
He's been there for the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as a principal organizer and artist.
Something surprising but he announced his withdrawal a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of artists and made flyers.
In this year there is also a 70-cent subletter brand designed for art & pleasure, available at each art station.
There can also be purchased for eight euros by Volker Hahn.
Hahn was pleased with the high appeal of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nürnberg was able to be won for the musical embellishment.
When walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windplay Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it.
There are artworks made of metal or ceramics, often equipped with colourful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitor on the right side of the "gloss tree" is expected by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a wooden dust, colourfully lightened, playful with 20 wind wheels, 24 hubs and 24 alu tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun bleaching through the bushwork in the background, the object acts thoroughly consumed and loads to stay.
Barbara washneck comes from Eckental, which prefers in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
At half a distance, Siegrid Frey from Eckental has issued her work "The Wind the Heaven Child".
And at the end of the area Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination of sound, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windplay Performance" to pass through the versatile art exhibition.
By 31 December 2018, the special exhibition can be visited.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singer celebrate 50th birthday festival
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And also the Albachtens then made their humility air.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to find out that after the resolution of the church chord "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the city area.
It has now become a legend: at a bank in the tinbush they raised the MGV 68 albachts from baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "house of the encounter".
"It's gonna be full today," said Chairman Jürgen hollows, and he should keep right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albachten singers.
They had been resurrecting the foundation for the anniversary.

Volleyball: 3. Liga Women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The riser marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under screen rule by Axel Büring is quite right in Liga three.
No trace of shoes or fractures, the independents do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee really good.
"That wasn't glass clear, but we've already left the impression," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately committed: "This is a defeat that we can live very well with.
We are not inadequate." On the contrary.
In the evening at a subsequent birthday celebration by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game stopped.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical misleading.
In the third sentence, the guests had a sentence ball.

Finally, the USC made everything clear with its routine forces and brought the full exploit to the goal.
"We all know who is in such a Derby on the other side.
That doesn't break us.
I have seen a very good volleyball in fashion," Annacker did not hesitate with the 0:3 - and immediately went to the agenda.

"For that it's just too early," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredible good level.
This is not closely comparable with regionalliga-Volleyball. In the fourth league, they do not want to look downward anyway.
If the West is not polluted in the next weeks, they have to look upwards.
However, a first balance sheet can only be drawn after ten, eleven parties.
On Saturday it's only going to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in food on October 14th.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Trumship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she openly says that the series could have had a co-debt in her marriage with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of the Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Tromship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018, she went from board forever.
The series that made her become a star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she was married for ten years.
"That could have been a reason too.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues saw me at eye height," says Keller in conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
First, she was always just "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but this changed with the "Tromship".
Because now the journalists only called to Heide Keller.
"If he liked it so well, I don't know."
She thinks it is possible that her dawn man could have been very jealous, but "as many men also shouted his conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only right one and he wanted to know my fears not to know my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have turned myself," as she continues to explain.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me a emancipated woman that I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared freaky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Hertner, Keller said again yes, "although I was afraid that it could also go wrong a second time."
On the day before the total grief, I was crying in the garderobe and wanted to say anything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why didn't you ever work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller imagined love at that time "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I have been too naive to love."
The nightfolder, who regularly explores the city's nightlife at the NZZ Ressort Zürich, has been guarding at the ZFF opening party this time.
Our folder is not a moth, but a little lightweight.
And the grey glow, in which a green carpet is dug on the sexel seed, blinds it over fee.
But it's a film festival, there's more or less famous in the light.
So, on this late Thursday evening, he flirts over the place in order to facilitate himself shortly in the "Aquaclean WC-Oase".
The public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival, is called: the need-holder in the parting of a new pavilion has a lot of effort to flow a luxurious ambience.
But this evening it stinks in the Lord Oase for some reasons to heaven.
So get out of here, go to the other side of the street: Loaded guests who have just enjoyed the opening film "Green Book" at the best level in the cinema, celebrate the festival start every year with a party in the three-sized warehouse.
This name fits perfectly for this film festival: From the whole earthball comes known to the works shown.
What do you need to do with an article about this festival in order not to disappear in advertising for its 190 partner companies?
The folder binds a bandlet around the sensors that put a good fee to him, and two bully door managers actually wink him generously in.
Inside, the invited ones are pressing to dance far after midnight to live music or to be presented by DJ rhythms to whom they cry to each other, and wash down with Cüpli exquisite puppies.
In the delicate dining store in the souterrain, easters are waiting for swinging mouths, next to the incomparable crude Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut up, a chocolate fountain sprouts.
And the hammer is: All the sales halls full of exclusive products have not been removed for the occasion.
This has been so for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The folder studys the sign at the rolling staircase: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the rolling staircase."
If the two separate instructions are, he has become in the dress code.
But it's rather a conditional design, and it's certainly already saved life.
In the upper floor department, the poultry kicks a cocktail prepared with Espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the Festival Award.
The price for the best drink is not compulsory for this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been throwing for a brand, isn't here in the evening either.
However, between local prominencies, tables and kitchen articles, there is a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
It's not supposed to be far away from his main performer.
And really: Likewise, Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost like a chorknabe, walks through the crowd.
He's not being added, he's not hired, one's scolded at most.
Just for this restraint, like misunderstanding as a clarity, international stars love this film festival.

Munich - In times of the digital "Fastfood-Datings" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a specialist place for the great love is almost an anachronistic romantic.

Wolbeck had significantly more plays in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs, before his out (17th), switched Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th), missed the lead.
Almost this would have happened when the SCA in minute 41 equally two times in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberboomer was dangerous before the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be master of his expertise.
After the break, VfL frequently took over full control.
Thieves from 18 meters failed hardly.

When Old Rhines Chris Naberboomer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was 18 meters before the guest house an indirect release for the placelords.
The arrogant arrived himself and demonstrated his danger in standards.
Westhues" Thing with the right slope hit down to the left from the view of the protector - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes, they should be fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck flew unfortunately to the hand of the leather in the penalty room in the 80th minute.
Defendant Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not escape the gift (79.).
Well-minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase, before in the 87th minute of twelve meters the winner had on the pussy.
Could have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26. L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Family) - Thewes

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in business
This resulted in only 8 percent of the boards were female on the day of 1 September, as the report "The Power of Monoculture", which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday and presented the German Press Agency in advance.
"The companies will have to set up differently, otherwise the international competitors will cross them," said foundation business leader Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely malely occupied leaderships - with few exceptions - are no longer imaginable.
The remainder makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented compared.
It's another business culture.
The small increase in the proportion of women among the German stock exchange companies is only due to positive impulses in the enterprises of the medium-sized value index (MDax).
Although, according to allbright, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
However, in the previous year, the value remained 3.8 per cent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the past years of pre-residents - the women's share stacked.
Lastly, 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women again in the coming year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that they would not continue to take self-debtedness to increase the proportion of "nul percent" to date.
Another picture can be found in the Supervisory Boards: from 1 September there, the proportion of women was 30,5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"If a number of women were recruited annually for the boards, it would have reached a proportion of 40 per cent in 2023," says the report.

In the first half of the year, Ferrari made with every sold car 69,000 Euros operating profit - Jaguar Land Rover, however, is only about 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put on it in every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are good in race at prices from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euro profits before interest and taxes EBIT.

In the collision of the use vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passenger has been injured fatally.
When note doctors are called, they should help - best save human life.
Such a rescue journey took a fatal end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - In the collision of an emergency car with a taxi, a 26-year-old pedestrian has been injured fatally in Bonn.
The taxi drivers, the physician and their drivers were severely injured as the police told.
On Saturday afternoon, the 46-year-old driver of the emergency physician had crossed a red amp with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then crashed on a cruise with the taxi that drove at green.
After the collision, the doctor's car threw against an ampelmast and a tree.
He recorded the passenger who died at the accident site.
Carriage drivers and taxi drivers are severely injured
The 62-year-old taxi drivers and the emergency drivers were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be exempt from the use forces.
The 29 - year - old note physician also was able to liberate himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another note physician called on, however, tried to do this without success.
The three severe injured ones were brought to hospitals.
The police shall determine who is guilty of the accident in close conjunction with the Bonn State Prosecutor.
Somester United again loses it, for Mourinho we unpleasantly
After the blameable out in the ligacup, Manchester United is losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United ManU is subject to 1:3. The way of defeat may still be given to speak.
Significantly, the scene was in the 74th minute, in which the regenezed Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly led the Red Devils back to the game.
Since they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel Pass, all Manchester's defense players remained standing, and Arnautovic reads all the time in the world to pass the ball on the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of an earlier over long distances of insufficient performance.
At the Uniteds City Rivale Manchester City, the museum is currently different.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's large competitors Pep Guardiola came to a approximately 2:0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defense locker for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Agüero took care of the sixth victory in the seventh game after a good hour and a double pass with the formal port guard, and thus also for the jump to the table top.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 downlay in the ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
Like the cup-out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoners.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the game's only hit.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, just missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Better made it Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his locker.
So after the reds started with a makeless balance sheet in the week, Chelsea was not to be hit for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the Remis in the Liga, the Blues Liverpool was now falling from the table top.
Like City, the two London City Clubs of Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (mot Watford) also celebrated 2:0-victory.
However, the fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played through, had to be patient against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81th minute for a success message.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford Defence Craig Cathcart unfortunately buxed an inlet of Alex Iwobi to his own gate, only two minutes later Mesut Özil with his third season meeter took care of the decision.
Arsenal went along with Watford thanks to the fifth victory and is newly behind the large rival Tottenham on rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave upward Wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
The wolves remained unheated at 2:0 against Southampton in the liga for the fifth time in succession and provoked the 8th place.
VW mark missing: Paris Automobile Salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Paris Automobile Salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet all-time: The Diesel Candal and the ringing for driving bans and re-equipment are not expected to release the German automotive companies at the Branch Meeting in Paris.
At the Automobile Salon 2018, they show their news from next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel doesn't really play a major role anymore.
However, the possible exchange and retrofit offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are to be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, would still be an important topic at least behind the glossy scenes of fairs.
A large name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is there with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have among other things their first pure electric models: The e-tron of the Ingol Citys is to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgarter 2019.
But both have been officially presented.
The iNext of BMW will only start in 2021.
The new 3rd is in the centre of Paris.
Over 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to autogroups, motorcycles as well as numerous mobile and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
A million visitors came in 2016.
The heavy earthquakes and the following Tsunami have killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Thousands are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, enormous damage occurred.
After the rivers, the Tsunami broke in over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered at the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the numbers of victims are still significantly higher.
The figures are only from Palu until now.
However, there are also many other communities - along the west coast of Sulawesi.
Approximately 150 Bikers celebrate worship in Werdhl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated on Sunday with a helper team the final divine service for motorcycle drivers in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdhl - The place before the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcycle drivers on Sunday.
Indeed, the Final Divine Service for the Bikers was on the programme.
Frank Schröder is the engine pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and thus responsible for the soul care of the PS-star two-wheel drivers.
Between April and September, on the last Sunday of a month the traditional motorcycle god service (MoGo) takes place at the Nordhelle house.
The end of the season traditionally celebrates the bikers in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, on Sunday, about 150 bikers had gathered together to do anything other than usual worship.
Already from 10 o'clock, the ballites had been set up before the entrance portal of the church.
First of all, the biker frogs were on the program and it was possible to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a delicious curryworst.
Besides the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also there.
The preaching was held during the Biker Goth Service of Prir Dirk Grzegorek.
The Singer Songwriter, Valerie Lill, took care of the musical painting.
"Of the bikers prefer the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill is rather poetic-calm tones," said pastor Frank Schröder.
This was certainly a novum in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Fuchttorfer Home venue celebrates a great festival: after the apple the milk comes
Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
He was also interested in Georg Hartmann-Nierg.
He had his apple press in the baggage and demonstrated his amazing viewers step by step the process from the mature apple juice to the apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Nemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples into the great trigger.
With a little muscle force, the apples became a fine crushed mass.
Still, many of the children were probably not able to imagine how it should become a tasteful drink.
But also this important step of work they could look at this late Friday afternoon.
In shapes packed and wrapped by networks, Georg Hartmann-Nemerg stacked the little apple pieces that look a little like hecksel piece layer for layers over one another.
Thanks to some technical support, the last stage of work was no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the farmer had already completed specialities.
So he opened his "scatch" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "made in fogtorf" was similarly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of the apple press, but also discovered the built hipburg for themselves.
Activity of the feettorf Cambodia of former soldiers also engaged in the festival and invited to some stations for short-term games.
The home organisation will also offer a day of action in the coming year.
However, then, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, will not be the home house in the heart of the spargel village of the place of happening.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also on the hand because of the topic: finally it will go around milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with the fourth season: "Customy situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga-Niederlage, Trainer André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professor of Hannover 96 to himself and spoke to them courageously.
However, many positive things were not seen at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintrag Frankfurt.
"It's a damn situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96 football professional Pirmin Schwegler and pushed, "This is of course disappointing, because you always have a lot to do."
The further victorious Low Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) came to join, stands with two counters at the bottom and is a decline candidate in their current constitution.
In addition, Frankfurt celebrated the first season's home victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) reached the gates for the DFB-Pocal winner before 46.300 tourists who, after the successful general test for the Europe League game against Lazio Rome, moved to the centre of the table with seven points.
Croatia's Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in nearly every dangerous open action of the Hessen and never managed by Hannover's defense.
The storm long hit after the WM showed with its speed and enforcement capacity why it is so valuable for the effort.
Besides Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was borrowed by the FC Liverpool, was also the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurter, who started swinging.
One of Lucas Torró’s falsified headballs (17th) brought risk for the first time on the gate network.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a prominent position in the last moment by the 96 guard around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (Rücken).
The leadership for the houselords fell almost necessarily and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a defenced corner into the penalty room, Haller extended by head before the gate where Ndicka only had to hold the foot.
It was the first Federal League meeting for the defence players coming in summer from the French Second League AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt went after before the break.
This time Haller matched his storm partner Rebic, who thought through and didn't let a 96-thorn Michael Esser.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach broad riders responded to the weak idea of his eleven and brought two new open forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony was now playing a little more courageous, but ignition ideas remained until shortly before the end, when still the connector came.
The Hessens were much more efficient.
After a little hour, Rebic started a solo and then put across De Guzmán, which only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest of the Frankfurter was only a show run against overseas guests, also Jovic met one minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a partymile
Thrills Despite cool temperatures, good atmosphere took place at October Festival in the city centre.
The Mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter made it before millions of publics at the opening of the 185.
Municher Wies'n last week with two hits.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy-Kreuz-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy-Creuz festival on 14 September or on Sunday afterwards.
The festival service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy-Kreuz-Kirche with the graduate.
The Holy-Creus Church hosts the shot Christ, who comes from the 30th-year war and on which the legend should have shot after a Swedish soldier.
Then then the shot wounds ran blood.
From this, a great wall trip developed to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy-Creus Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar space stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, priest Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the importance of the Geisinger priesthood, the worship was badly visited.
After the service, the procession to the Holy-Creus Church took place, and with the conclusion, the church part of the Cross Festival ended.
For many years, the Catholic church chief will then invite to the worldly part of the festival into the Catholic priesthood.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty foods as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farmhouses.
In the afternoon, the parishes offered further leads around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Sector informed the visitors of the damages to fassade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue to move until next year.
After it has been a while, the damage could be more precisely identified and the individual tenders were prepared more concretely.
It is sure that renovation is more expensive than planned, since the damages already existed a few years ago have grown, but more has been found, which was only possible by the inertia by means of noise.
The soccer replacement work has been completed, before the winter, the natural stone work is still to be started, and it is hoped that the half of these works can be completed this year.
Dedication: New home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The life aid Donau Iller opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße, "a very special house" is now being handed over to his destiny - there were all attended at the deadline for dedication.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have already lived in the living home of Danube-Iller have been dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider gangs, loops and doors, larger rooms and accessible accesses for all areas have taken into account Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former official building of the U.S. Army was put on the test stand for the inhabitants with mobile cap: "The house had come in the years and no longer time in the equipment," said Bader backwards.
In 2016, the Baggers pressed to scrap the house.
The reconstruction should be designed as friendly and bright as possible to enable the inhabitants to feel well, according to the architect.
Life Assistance Donau Iller opens a new home
About 4.6 million euros invested life aid in reconstruction.
The free state amounted to EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben EUR 450000.
The construction work has remained in the planned framework, according to architect Bader - timely and financially.
Also thanked him for this, Jürgen Heinz, Managing Director of Life Assistance.
The spagat between a barrier-free and simultaneously fire-safe construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that would allow the inhabitants to experience freedom to move without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants who need help to be mobile."
The residency and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And continue: "The land in this situation is a real happiness, because it is no longer to acquire in today's situation."
Overall, the new home in the Münsterblickstraße offers nearly 1500 square meters space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three residential groups.
Stolz is the life-help business leader Heinz on the eleven full-time forces who are all employed by tariff.
Germany: Schwesig complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the Unity, the vice-president of the SPD Federal Minister Manuela Schwesig urged all countrymen not to find themselves with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that pain after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the "day level on Sunday".
The objective must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked longer in the average than the people in Western Germany, but 15 percent lower wages.
"I can tell nobody about that nearly 30 years after the German Unit," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this pink dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year Pungsan hunting dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax the relationships with Seoul, Pjöngang made a gift to South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moons office announced on Sunday, the two dogs aged about one year reached their recipients on Thursday.
They therefore happened to Panmunjom border with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the "invasion" of the animals.
The dogs with the thick white cliff, peak ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship gift had announced the North at the third summit this year between Moon and the North Korean powerholder Kim Jong Un Mitte September in Pjöngang.
Both countries also agreed to join international sports competitions such as the Olympic Games in 2020 and to apply together for the exclusion of Olympic Games in 2032.
During the mutual approximation, Kim also agreed to include the Tongchang Ri test system for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
At the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this memorial year for nearly ten months, many new books have appeared, which mostly answer this question in the backwards of the last hundred years.
It is quite different from Wolfgang Madertaner, historian and Director-General of the Austrian State Archive, in the magnificent "picture book" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to work - so is the inofficial motto for the work week of the Great Coalition that begins today.
Nearly an interview, hardly a speech in which the offices and their ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have lastly not tried to return to work.
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other professionals in this country to the legitimate question, which is the difference between work and work, but it is.
If the Federal Government is now to dedicate its assignment again - the government - it should not now be prevented by term debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blamages of the past weeks, may already show the Monday.
In the evening, the peaks of the government parties gather to the Coalition Committee.
Canzler Angela Merkel wants to call this round regularly to eliminate conflicts early; a doctrine from all the dispute.
First of all, however, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with the Diesel postal equipment and the expert immigration law.
CSU Traffic Minister Scheuer wants to make the automobile companies with exchange premiums glimpse away, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to re-equip the technical re-equipment of older diesel.
While in the diesel crisis over the weekend, the Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned professional immigration law.
The SPD calls for a stay perspective for rejected asylum applicants who work or do a training.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "trace change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be again dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equal and equal have joined GroKo, but three partners with partially very different social models and priorities.
Conflict is good.
Without dispute, a society signed by so many, sometimes contradictory interests does not come forward.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes must not be rebuilded for partial reasons on the question of His or His Nonness.
It's still about politics, not theater.
Union and SPD are to fight - but always have the reality of human life in mind.
What is viable and useful for many?
This key question enables both the diesel and the trace exchange question to be pragmatically clarified - and thus recovered confidence.
In particular, the people's parties have to fight now.
Pilz verified working hours in Hartinger
Ministry of the Vision
Does the Minister of Labour infringe the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at this more precisely.
"Really day and night" had worked her legistrates on social insurance reform, reported an overwhelming social minister at the presentation itself two weeks ago.
In the case of list-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is admired - she now brings the matter to Parliament via a request.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and no infringement of existing service law before running cameras".
Yet, she now has questions to be able to "free from any suspicion".
In search of women's bodies, police rippe up a street
Marxgreen - Lange didn't want to say it.
Now there's a confirmation.
During the early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been buried.
The route is still locked in the MarxGreen area until Monday.
In the past, the researchers had used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of ancient human bones was able to limit the relevant place to a few metres, together with his leader in multiple uses.
In addition, together with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bayerian Memorial Protection Authority, a ground anomaly was discovered in the field of the known roadpiece.
For more than a year ago, State Prosecutor and Criminal Police Court have been dealing with the missing case.
At Marxgreen, a cycling route has been locked and examined with sonar devices, because the investigators suspect that the new building of the state road could have been weakened 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Crawalls in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is the first time.
But it's already happening to Krawallen.
Separatists have not forgotten the police action from the autumn of 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independent Assembly of 1 October 2017, there have been conflicts between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, with colour powder as they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of national police and civilian guard.
About 3000 officials of Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues, who were in use last year at the illegal referendum in the electoral premises.
When attempting to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at that time.
The Catalan police would have formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of separatists and central government security forces separately, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the 6000 separatists would have tried by violence to break the police chain, and among other things, the officials bought color bags and eggs.
Six persons had been arrested that 24 more had been slightly injured, it was called upon the authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum takes place for the first time.
After the vote and a subsequent decision on the separation of the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid Catalonia had put in force in the autumn of 2017.
Then Regional President Carles Puigdemont flew into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also settled abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the regional government and other activists of the Separatist movement are still sitting in U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the entry into force of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
However, the new regional president Quim Torra is also based on the "right of self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Upperliga Westfalen: Collected Ratelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Axles divorces without delay
Red-White Ahlen continues to take place.
The FC goodssloh also reached only a 0:0 disagreement.
The final light and the third last one they disappeared before 438 viewers at the Heidewald Stadium as collected ratlessness.
The first half was reluctant of the entertainment factor.
Therefore, who would prefer to pick up a beer or a bratworst, could do this unfortunately.
There was no danger of missing a torchance, because there was virtually no.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (harmless) gatehead of the whole batch, Nick Flock signed in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only real - possibilities, the Ahleners, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG Torwart Frederic Westergerling, had forced a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty border.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Stormer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged injury conditionally, for him Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasingly emerging shyness.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed 18 metres closely over the housing and after an hour the goods lowers appeared for the first time offensively.
After a ball conquest of Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The quick-presented account over Sinan Aygün "Kronte" Nick Flock (62.) with a but lazy shot in the arms of RWA Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball from Wieckowicz (66th) after a corner ball of the Ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA Interim Trainer Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahleners did not accomplish.
Only in the 91th minute, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but they also brought nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to stretch out the positive: "I like that we played at zero," but unfortunately, the zero also stood forward.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as yet against wooden wounds and that although our opponent had no desire to play here," RW Ahlen's interim trainer stated.
Offensive "plotting everything a bit" against a team, "which only wanted to defend.
At least I didn't feel that we could get a counter," said Daut.
However, as an audience, one did not feel like his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too necessity.
Receiving fields: Fortunately there are enough creams
This welcomes Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the fields of table edition for which these donations are intended.
The honourable officers assure: "These donations remain in Reckenfeld as well."
At the opening, the sky appeared radiatingly blue, but the place was still empty, but this should change over the day.
Because, "Hier it's so nice, so we're here today," said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a ordinary price of humor.
For the couple Brockmann, who should actually be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Creimer jumped in short.
Verena (the daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there's enough creams.
And the "replacement" did not take it to talk between musically the increasingly growing visitors.
It was so good that later some people were sing with.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to put the opening date this time in his schedule.
He rejoices over the many actives with their stations, including mainly associations.
"In fact, there should not be anything like a table at all," he nevertheless thanked himself for the action of the men's chores.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stations and also included the further festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden city has a colorful stroke - here's what's going on.
Then the maichrance was taken by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the firearm and brought to the winter quarter.
Many stations have been worked for the physical welfare.
From sweet to hearty, everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decoupier saw.
Furnier work, beer deck with fields of motifs and some more he had in the offer.
A speciality offered three rekkenfelder Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Bush-Schleifer.
The last one has another speciality.
Honey cake in the glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Then the little Elsa had to access again and again, so well tasted the cake.
The company is that the visitors then left to stay long until the evening hours, even without stage program that is not available at the autumn festival.
Smoors with local policy message: No successful advertising for treasury plants
In Lengerich, unknowns have probably hardly been able to support the construction of a treasure plant.
In several places, there are similar jewelry, says Jürgen Kohne by the city administration on request of the WN.
At least one case has been penalised by the police indication for damage.
In large letters, among other things, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich" on the Gamp-Halle and the Old Councilhouse are called "Skatepark for Lengerich".
Michael Rottmann, Manager of the Hall, reports that after the professional election fair on 19 September, an appropriate texture was discovered on the advertising sign on the stairs rise to the Gamp-Bistro.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with a dinner at the time, it could easily be removed.
"But a few days later, this was back there, this time sprayed," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is just given to this case by calling on the table several large companies from Lengerich.
If the treasury is built, it is also intended to enable its realisation by sponsors.
Assistance is already made to explain Jörg Hesselmann from the urban field of school, sport and culture, without name.
However, it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the decorated table.
For years local policy and administration have been focused on the topic of taxation.
After the old one was degraded at the LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
Finally, the Council spoke to a majority for the fire-wear parking lot.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors seemed to be against a construction at this point.
The end of June followed a turning.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says to the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word then has the city council.
It is withdrawn from a decision this year, so that a positive vote in 2019 could be built.
Straight pass for air navigation becomes worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European Air Traffic Chaos in summer, the German airlines do not see any signs of improvement in the next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong winds and then the storm comes," said the head of the air navigation union, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the air navigation summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known staff need for European air navigation, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve fast improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," said the trade unions.
Europe-wide, the market for fully educated lots was empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone for monitoring the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized the fact that various air traffic trade unions were not invited to the summit.
On Friday, representatives of the Federal, the countries, air navigation, airlines and airports gather together to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work digestion and overtimes, this will not go without us," explained the director of the GdF, who has many members at the Federal German air navigation.
Maas again made the EU Commission's requirements responsible for the Lotsen-Mikers.
Transport forecasts for the period of regulation that runs until 2019 have been much too low.
The cost and staff savings resulting from national air navigation systems are now fully undergoing operational operations.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to use in Brussels regulations that "do not further cut off air security".
At present, EU measures would be voted by 2024 and there should be further sharpness.
The EU is subject to constant lobby pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair-Chef Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now harvest exactly what they have sought in recent years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs of the airlines have reconsidered.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German air navigation (DFS) offers a "voting training and future pact", said Maas.
The uptake of 120 Lotsen Schools, which has been announced so far, over the next five years was just enough to compensate for the older-related departures.
The necessary staff building is not yet associated with this.

Better employees' wages and assessment
The police wanted to honour the colleagues who had been committed almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum forbidden by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Populars of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they.
The demonstrators felt it as a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrant Manel Perez of the AFP News Agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drove us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearians who wanted to give his name only with Daniel rejected the claim.
"Of course, we want to support our companions who did their duty last year only: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there for the exercise of our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a large European city and there is more Echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not coming to provoke," insured the police.

Football: Juve trainer praises by top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese Star Stormer "played the best game this evening with the half-hour of Valencia," praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) -winning the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer the expensive Star was also without its own gate of the decisive man in the important party against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing good," said Allegri.
Even though we started with tactic mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and we grew from the moment on.
Thanks to the three ports of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early remnant through the meeting of Dries Mertens (10th minute) and first depended on the worst persecutor.
The gateman collected by Real Madrid first set up the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double package (26/49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner per headball, also carried out the preparing work for the meeting of defence manager Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had to postpone just before the gateline.
"He gives many templates," praised the trainer.
But, of course, Allegri also wants to see gates from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record-tour-proof.
"We have to get better in serving him," the coach asked.
Best Juve Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the power of Juventus seems to become more depressed.
Seven wins in seven games are the makeless series in series A. At 21 points, the master of the backward seven years has already six counters in front of Naples.
The table second trained by the former Bayer Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not at chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the reference of Mario Rui's already confused (58th), the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to go too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow root from the place.
"We have played well against a good naple," the Turin Coach commented.
At the same time, Emre Can could feel.
The German national player has survived at Juve.
The professional from the FC Liverpool was in use for all seven Liga parties.
The middle field player also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flying from the place at the 2:0 victory of the Turin and was locked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
Rapper Kanye West has given attention to the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" in the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided for pears and question marks with the viewers.

For now you may just call him "ye", the musician.
"The creature previously known as Canye West," he twisted on the basis of the dead singer Prince when he put his artist's name.
The pseudonym, however, is not a news.
Already the tenth album appeared under that name.
In an interview with the radio broadcaster KRL, the artist explained that "Ye" has a religious significance for him.
"I think "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "yes", says the rapper.
Football: Circle A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage made no hole from his disappointment.
This was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was just more tangible, we have never put it before problems. As thin, the list of Hoetmars is read.
Grade times two Torchances in 90 minutes, so it is rare to make games positive.
Football Crisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first used Maik Krause from peak angle to early lead (7.).
In the 43th minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great pre-working of Krause he understood free standing.
The hosts had only a double option when first Moritz Höne failed to Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftersupply Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break the guests became still dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all forgave.
A trade meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with hand on the gateline and saw it red - also Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stowed the ball over the line, the party was decided (81.).
"We had criticized ourselves hard before, that was then different today from the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.

Football: Circle A2 Münster: Spectacle football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"Then I don't know what to think of it," he ranked in words.
"We have no access to them at all." With that he condemned the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but well all the other green whites that occurred with collective offensivity.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said, twinched frech and pulled from then His players, on the other hand, was note the lighting that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well-known, after a dual of two teams, one of whom, namely Albachten, plays the mastership and the other, Albersloh, fights for the class content.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was our best seasonal performance with distance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2, how we over the entire playtime against one of the top men of the League, that was already really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you have to drive home with empty hands.
Top tour hunter Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season meeting (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2:0 he put over the left side musterworthy on for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but a player like this can't be held out completely.
"That was already crazy what he made," Lewandowski unnecessaryly recognized the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the page change, his own eleven made the compensation: McGill's left-hand seal between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through the long torch (45.).
After the page change, it was McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
Afterwards it went down and down.
It was a snatchy, action-loaded game.
Neebel shocked Albachten again (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann was born (69.).
Despite the excess rate, Albersloh did not reconstruct the last Concordia strike (80.) again.
We must now focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against sheep, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until mid-year.
That is why France's President Emmanuel Macron has signalled to personally pick up the tolerance price in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as the Federal President, he was not at Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and afterwards Wulff was there to guest.
This was how Academy Director Udo Hahn said proudly: "All Federal Presidents and Chancellor were already with us." That at the Academy at the Tutzing Castle, there were always prominents, but the presentation of the annual programme was also a topic.
At the end of October, songmaker Constantine Wecker takes part in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on September 29th the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting about his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also said that he wants to receive the "Tolerance Prize" given to him by the Academy in Tutzing personally, which is also received in another category tourist Dunja Hayali (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid 2019 have it in itself.
"The pension is just not safe!" says in a meeting title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria, "Barbarei without limit."
Armed deals, destruction, torture, death - the war abuses any human idea."
From structural racism in society through the sharpness between arm and empire to radical change in work by digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academy Director Hahn convinced himself: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can gather together to search for solutions or at least part solutions."
At a meeting at 200.
The birthday of Karl Marx will soon expect a more visitor to the direction of capitalism criticism, the others rather a tendency "from left outside to the middle".

Music Cabaret: Sexual understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - West Fake News
The musical cabaret with Tina Teubner was suitable for both adults and men on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabarettestin, teubners forged gender understanding, not only with humour and heartheart for the (feeling) woman and (feeling) husband and what else may be, but also with music.
The mini gitarre put it in and also mastered her violin.
On the wing, Ben Süverrup was sitting.
It is one of the male sparring partners, who sometimes come to the end of the sentence, to the second one a true pianist: So the royal harmonious accompanys Süverrup Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
It was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, as it fits to the red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had brought a paradoxon into the game: The satisfaction of the man is coming if he has a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, brings no benefit.
The Piano Solo now demonstrates itself: What would have escaped from the composer of Mozarts, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unforeseenly?
So Süverkrüp glews over in improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" into the "Song of Death" and from Mozart g-Moll symphony into a gamed dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers delivered Karlheinz Kleinje, treasure champion of the association, the Chansonette.
But the Chairman of Heidemarie Markenbeck did not take any additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the Duo next to the appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt one in Wolbeck.

The widespread exclusion of the German public has "enforced many reservations".

From pure fruit production to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the Circle Association for Garden Construction and National Care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit sight at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the last founding impression for the Circle Association for Garden and Landpflege Kulmbach was set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kulmbach City Hall on Saturday evening.
He said then, "According Fruitbauverein Kulmbach City and Land" he was raised from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-building association was also different from today's work - it was actually about the fruit, flowers and gardening that day no one thought.
"The fruit tree was a favorite kid of the elites at that time, in the era of information," explained Circle Home Career Günter Dippold in his festival lecture.
Fruit trees should evacuate remote roads, schools have been built so-called industrial gardens.
Fruit construction is still the task of 55 gardening associations in the district of Kulmbach, comprising nearly 7000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A naturally close gardening, biological plant protection, village beauty and nutrition plays an equal role as the mediation of knowledge, healthy diet and youth work.

"Young work is urgently necessary especially in the digital age," said the Circle Chairman of Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The castania collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that with smartphone & Co. you can gather a lot of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with the Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are supposed to stand, the circuit group decides," the Landrat Söllner supplemented and highlighted the particular importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The circuit is for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the district, the circuit business leaders and experts in Friedhelm Haun also left no doubt.
He led the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the circuit and reported, among other things, the need for self-supply after war.
Earlier everything came out of the garden, for winter it was induction.
In the end of the 1950s, however, the garden of use has turned into a cereal and housing garden.
"The nature has remained, it was already there before us and we have to focus on it," the expert pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, for the garden building associations, it is encouraged not to leave behind so that our home remains beautiful and vital.
This also includes welcomeing the new citizens of our associations, the President of the Bavarian Confederation, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the eclatant decline in insects, that's what we owe our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful festival that was celebrated by the towers of the Thurnau music association.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canada’s Foreign Minister held UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity in matters Naphtha: you are making both trading partners an Ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada's Minister for Foreign Affairs now grants absolute priority to the Trade Agreement - and moves her speech to the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure on ringing for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, the Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed its speech at the UN General debate in New York.
Instead of speaking on Saturday, the minister will only speak on Monday before the full assembly of the United Nations, her speaker shared Adam Austen.

Protests against presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured at a knife attack, left the hospital.
The right extreme ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lived, after a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will take public action in the south-American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked on open road at the beginning of September during a election event in southern Brazil.
In the meantime, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people went to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Not"), women's associations had called to protest against the ex-military.
Also in the social networks, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and fraud-despending statements mobile.
Several thousands of demonstrators were expected in the São Paulo economy.
In the capital of Brazil, the protests were mixed with an announcement of the presidential candidates of the Brazilian Worker Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He arrived at the place of former president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for corruption and should not therefore be candidate.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As former Mayor of the million city of São Paulo, Haddad was in surveys far behind the right-extreme candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been mixing in politics for a long time, it is now presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates in the first round reaches the absolute majority, there is a stamp election on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will come out of this non-successful - no matter who he approaches.
Bolsonaro is known for glory against homosexuals and blacks and the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He shocks again and again with verbal disguises.
Another time he said that the trailers of Lulas left working party should be shot.

In addition, the Head of Government reminded that the Monarchy-Resident Larsen had occurred in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rocknight in the shoe factory: volume at pressure hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and ignition a concert tab with the power of a tiger."Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ingnition" lay such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Civil Center Shoe Factory: Hardrock pur of three with another friends band.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert start, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace from lamp fever.
Afterwards, the Rock Protagonists from Ahlen and surroundings - all in connection with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - are enthusiastic with their bands, according to the 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Already the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with the frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince the optake of the conservation with the latest, unknown pieces of their own feather and the nearest CD.
In front of the stage, the band will be danced as a voiceful and printing interaction.
Though "admission" calls are not to be overwhelmed, then leave "Tiger Bonesaw" to the trio "Here We Stand" the stage.
That Hardrock is not like Hardrock, showing the guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the Bass and Slagmaker Kai Holzscher with its alternative, sometimes to classical rocks of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock, a synthesizer is also used.
Not only the desirable, just to be balladened "Take Me Home" is covered by the change of melodic passages to the guitar-loading rock reefs of the multi-layer songs.
However, the quartet "The Ingnition" of Tunneshues has been a special degree of knowledge since its foundation in 2005.
Full of agility, the band presents her hardrock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ingnition" has a special stage experience with its appearances before a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tour in China from 2017 - is obvious and unavoidable.
Songs and guitarist Tim Jungmann also set up the only gecovert song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s, very own accents.
At the end of the day, the guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a rejoicing solo, running through the audience.
A certain volume belongs to a simple hardrock concert, of course, to the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the mixed team at the threer concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ingnition" is about 98 decibel.
This is at the press air hammer level, but it is still clearly below the exams of the "wack-fetitvals", pointing to the "The Ingnition" on their website.
But the Ahlenian audience does not need to eat at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky gang type have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and its own compositions.
"Here we stand, we have taken the bone saws and ignited a concert stick with the strength of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the transmitted sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of visitors.

A dead in the case of a sailing aircraft accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim Airport/Essen, a fatal accident has occurred.
On a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailing plane is crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near Mülheim Airport/Essen, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.
As the "West-German General Zeitung" reports, a sailing plane crashed at the fair parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was killed.
As the "WAZ" further reports, the air schooler was on board alone - the flyer is supposed to be a seat.
The plane has already been in landing at the time of accident.
The crash station is located only near a capital on the airport area.
But a October festival has been held since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the border of the two ruhr districts and directly on the trip to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park & ride offer at large events at the fair food or the Gruga hall in food.
Trump tries Kim: "And then we have in love."
That the U.S. president of North Korea's powerholder Kim has been well-sensitive in spite of nuclear crisis, is not a secret.
Now Trump has made his colleague a regular declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the delicate age of 72, the married president of the US has known for a new flame.
The Tragic: It's a remote relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual explanation of love to the North Korean powerholder Kim Jong Un.
In front of adherents in the United States of West Virginia, Trump found almost very dear words for the half-old splash of the rulers' dynasty from Pjongjang, although it proves to be quite thoroughly deflective in the ring around North Korea's nuclear defence.
"I was foolish, he also, and between us it went along and out," the Trump reported.
And then we in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have led his heart to melt.
He wrote beautiful letters to me, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also beared political fruits: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics have seen little more than lip awareness.
That the affection of the "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - is not supposed to be any memoryr, the President of the US seemed to be well aware.
In any case, he took the criticism to expect in his appearance in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling straight away: "Donald Trump says they have in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresident.
But he cared very little for this, explained Trump and then directed his finger to the crowd: "I always told you it is so easy to be presidential."
But then there wouldn't be 10,000 people out there in this plumbing-filled arena, but we'd only have been standing outside 200 people.

Refugees saved from libysch prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have pointed through a mobile video to their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya and thus enable their salvation.
The group had turned up in its cell in the coastal city of Sawija in July under life danger and spread online.
"You refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website, whose editors alarmed the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally fled out to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya when attempted to reach the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life, according to his own statement.
One of his contests had been struggled by the wards almost to death, said Onyeka.
Generally, the prison conditions had been catastrophal: "They all struck us with pipes and stacks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink out of the latrine.
The IOM organizes voluntary reception of refugees beached in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their home this year by means of the program, said the IOM speaker in the Western African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now saved Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the bad prison conditions in Libya.
He hasn't heard of a mobile phone call yet.
International organisations have criticized the conditions in the libyan refugee camps since long as human invaluable.
The North African State, which is dominated too many parts of militia, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

Germaner was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in the middle of France, after he had trapped the car on the side of all forest paths and blocked a tree the car door.
Rescue forces discovered the car on Saturday afternoon accidentally near a wedding and released the missing ones since Tuesday evening, the police informed on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health condition despite the cold nights and the long time without supply.
He claimed to look forward to his home now.

Despite intensive search measures, the man’s remainance had remained unclear for days.
Laschet admonishes the state of law in Turkey
Köln NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has in conversation with the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan urged the state of law in Turkey according to its own information.
The relationships of the two countries are currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Cologne airport.
This is particularly about arrest waves, press and religious freedom.
He therefore made it clear in Erdogan that if relations are to be normalised in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, the rule of law is a very important prerequisite.
Laschet also mentioned the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey, according to their own information.
He formulated the expectation that freedom of expression should be respected.
Then Erdogan again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The discussion of Laschet and Erdogan was transferred to a short-term airline building of the Federal Defence Ministry at the Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place on the castle's wrath - but that the castle owners had rejected from political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to travel to open the Ditib mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
He said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - not the Turkish President.
Missing confidence in the United States: North Korea demands disarmament
While U.S. President Trump is not tired of highlighting the success of negotiations on the denuklearisation of North Korea, the East Asian regime is more prone to the situation.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for Washington's counterpart.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has proposed the U.S. Government to block the negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its persistent sanctions.
"The recent stop is therefore that the United States builds on compulsory measures that are fatal for trust training," Ri in New York said.
A disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we first defend ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat concluded.
That penalties could force North Korea to "cnuts" are "a dream of people who don't know us".
However, in order to build confidence, his country stopped his nuclear and missile tests and destroyed an atomic test, Ri highlighted.
However, from the US site there were no "compliant reactions", the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and rocket program, the United Nations Security Council alone decided three sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year.
President Donald Trump and his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, have in the past few days tried to comply strictly with the penalties.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump had hit North Korea's powerholder Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the President of the United States seeks a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is to return to discussions about the end of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme to Pyongang.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The fact that they were actually at a youth meeting, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing: White roofs and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the harvest thanks.
Beautifully, the HoT youths had the buffet with costumes from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves for the food.
The start with the new facility was not just easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the leader of the HoT, remembers.
We had our refrigerators filled with food and ingredients before the summer break and were best prepared on the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break the bad surprise: a power failure had disposed of the huge, two-part refrigerator, the food was corrupt and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the front: although we received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and youths wanted to create it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's how everyone packed up.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"Best it can't cook either," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido carbide soup was served or the guests were allowed to use silk, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and youths have put on their legs," emphasized pastor Frank Beckmann, while magic Stephan lambs with cardtricks and other pieces of art provided amazement.
Jürgen Sator leaves the national board NRW of the table
From the frustration of criticism from its own series, the chief of the Essener Table, Jörg Sartor, has delivered his posts in the National Association.
Sartor had become widely known because the Essener Table had introduced a stop for foreigners.
He had already returned in July as Vice-Chief of the NRW tables, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen too many in my back.
The Chief of the Tablen-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed its understanding of the decision of his long-term alternate representative.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
"I can accomplish his step - there people have said that they didn't know exactly why the food tables did."
But Sartor is still active for the food table - "six days a week, there's nothing to change", said Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized colleagues from other tables in the "World on Sunday".
You may not follow the approach, "without us the people in the city are hungry."
It is the responsibility of the State to ensure that people were not hungry.
The Essener did not participate in a congress of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"There's been told me too much sweet shoes," he said.
There are all these social puzzis that criticized me so much at that time.
SF Lorch play 2:0-direction - Gmünder Day Post
Football, Districtliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV hypocrites victory in Kirchheim for residue - Bettrings strike Lauchheim clear.
With 2:0 Lorch was in the home game against the TV Neuler already in lead - at the end it stood 2:3 and the disappointment of the sports friends was great.
Differently the TV hypocrites: In Kirchheim the TVH quickly hit 0:1, but after 90 minutes with 2:1. At the top of the table, the SGB was able to have a 3:0.
Gladbach plays two-time guide - Schalke without Embolo with the first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach needs to continue to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the fools play a lead twice.
Schalke comes against Mainz for the first seasonal victory (1:0).
(sda) Four times in the first five league games with early counters have manoeuvred to the end.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco put back that strength on the day with which it had occupied the first place behind the Bayers during the last season.
Alessandro Crew led the home equipe in the eleventh minute after strong preparing by Jewgeni Konopljanka per head, and the hosts thus preserved the minipolster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund is new from the top of the Federal League.
The team of Lucien Favre had traded against Bayer Leverkusen until the break a 0:2-response, but in the second half of the time was the 4:2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) compared with a doublette within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, which was exchanged by Favre in the 63th minute, provided with another doublette in the final phase (86./94.) for the crowning end of the performance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also came to the first victory.
Against the yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic already dezimated before the break, Werder Bremen had to scare the Stuttgarter in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the unnoticed Goalie Ron-Robert targets fabrished a courageous rejector that helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a complete lucky but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who joined the Swiss Quartett Yann Summer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Long, gave a lead twice, finally played 2:2 and still waiting for an outward victory in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1 Renato Steffen was responsible with his second Federal Ligator.
Yann was powerless at the flat shooting of 20 metres of the Aargauer, as was the second meeter after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends in Gladbach are quite exciting.
Alassane Pléa appears to be a goal guitar in the storm of the fools.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchases from OGC Nice met for the third time in sequence and for the seventh time in the seventh duty game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach is occupying the 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen manoeuvred against the VfB Stuttgart in an unpleasant position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgarter conter, which the Ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis concluded with his first season meeting, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued his team: The 23-year-old servant cassetted after a tricotzupfer against Daniel Didavi Gel-Rot.
Although Stuttgart's Defence of Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Targeters brought back the Bremers through a courageous rejector (68.) to the game, a quarter hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot back the stuttgarts acting on the victory street.
Nürnberg decided the Duell against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereign for himself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already brought the home team through Foulpenalty.
Macedonians vote on new state names
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens today agree on whether the name of their country should be changed to North Macedonia.
In the case of a yes, the almost three decades of swelling conflict with the neighbour of Greece could be resolved.
Athens had been on a change of name because of his Northern Province and blocked any approach to Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could become a quick member of the NATO at a positive outcome.
Syrian in U-Haft.
Refugees attacked three women.
A Syrian crushed three pensionists brutally and thereby injured them somewhat.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker had randalized on Friday at 22 p.m. in the escape gases in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused person who went on passengers with balled feet and tried to attack them on his behavior.
Then the Syrian tried to hit the officials.
Little later, it appeared that the suspect had hit three older ladies (65, 67, 75) with his fists at the Währinger Road shortly before.
He had also stepped the trio with his feet.
The pensionists were partly severely injured.
They suffered haematoma, shocking and brain shaking.
The asylum advertiser was also severely injured for an unknown reason, as the police said.
He was brought to the hospital and was continuously monitored during treatment.
SPD politicians: John Kahrs marries his friend
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-term friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave the yaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for her, Kars had said before the "Image" magazine.
"If we marry, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary speaker of the SPD Friday fraction and one of the seaheimer’s speakers, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Federal Day debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused with an indignant view on June 30, 2017.
Thus, he had pretended Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "rolled" himself in the topic.
"That was your Shabowski-Moment," he said in reaction to the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, equal pairs can marry just like heterosexuals.
In the past they had been able to enter their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the law of adoption.
Garden day: 400 meters crop cut
There was a lot of work before the members of the Civil Association Children's House and the Lepra Society.
Because about 400 meters of hills around the gardens of the inhabitants of the plunderhouse should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for around twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce the costs," explained the Chairman of the Civil Association Walter Schröer.
And there's been a lot of things that have been collected.
Because of the hot summer, we're late this time, but fortunately it's just a shape cut.
Because in the spring, the hook has been cut off once.
The following breakfast on work has also a long tradition.
"It's supposed to be all with forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner picks up gold at the Canuslalom-WM
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal in Rio de Janeiro at the end of the Canuslalom World Championship.
The 29-year-old put a perfect walk on the Olympia bar on Sunday.
Two years ago, he had missed the Olympia Brown about three hundredths of seconds.
I was well prepared, had already enough riding here on the plant and it's all right today," said the Olympia third of London 2012.
For the purpose, he threw his paddle away for joy and reared both arms safely to the height - well-knowing that it would be at least enough for a medal.
He always had start number four.
However, the six still remaining launchers couldn't top his fabel time of 89.69 seconds.
Secondly, the Czech Republic became Jiri Prskavec before the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting refers to the first invasion attempt of this autumn in a single family house.
Fortunately, the actors failed.
The days will be shorter - that's what breakers want to use again.
Thus, the police inspector Gauting mentioned yesterday the first invasion attempt to this autumn.
The fact that it has remained at the enthusiasm at the king's wise street is the alarm system.
It went off when the actors put hand on Friday just 20 p.m.
Although the burglars realized that the inhabitants were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them so that they took the escape without prey.

Pleite at Hertha: Getting from reality: Bavaria against Ajax demanded
The preaching is indispensable: The nederlage in Berlin wants the FC Bayern "not to fall".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate phase for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small performance depth under the new Coach Niko Kovac is not supposed to increase to a greater fall depth for the coins.
"A week ago, one had the impression, we are unquestionable.
Now we got some reality," Thomas Müller found after the earned 0:2-deposit at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction to the Champions League doll with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us, he knows that this is really annoying us and that's why we're going on Tuesday gas.
For the first time for more than one year no own gate shot, as at the same time of the pre-saison two compulsory games in series without victory, the table leadership in the football bundesliga first lost at Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the end phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intensive man-gen-man-tact and the Berliners through their playable needle sticks across the outside have delivered equally two blaupause, as the last superpowering bayers are to hit.
"The ones who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like this and we'll do everything so that we'll be successful again," said Kovac.
Otherwise, he walked with his losers in his birth town surprisingly and threw his first defeat as a Munich Coach only on the again inadequate dealing with opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday, before the country's play break, would still make the first intermediate phase of his term of office positive - otherwise, the sound is likely to be sharpened.
So Kovac did not undertake any exceptional measures at Benfica Lisbon after the 2:0 season before the second king class appearance.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which had forced to the optake AEK Athens also solemnly with 3:0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will make our gates again," announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the lost pokalfinale against the entry of Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke Klarxt.
The defendant appeared in the role of Mahner.
"I don't think that this is all cheek, we have to work it again, because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old stressed shortly before the departure from the Olympia Stadium.
On the seventh game day of the previous game, the Bayers were even with five counters behind Dortmund, which has now taken the top with a point of front.
And so Kimmich appreciated at least positively with an eyelid that now the public debate on the supposedly unsuccessful Bayern has ended.
"Yes, that's all right," said the national player.
It's already good for the liga.
DFB boss in shot line: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan to Grindel
With heavy claims, Turkish President Erdogan is excreting Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees errors, but defends the bondline.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages Recep Tayip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought around the deutmentality of the Mesut Özil permanent strit theme.
After the Turkish President strongly criticized the dealing with the ex-world champion in Germany, the DFB-Chef defended the Confederationline for opening the large distil mosque in Cologne.
In the early Sunday morning, the grindel who was attacked by Özil personally announced consequences from the Causa in the Mainzer ZDF "Sport Studio".
"We must draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with migration backgrounds in the U-manships - that such a thing is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration background as a further integration agent.
At the same time, Grindel again explained that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and DFB.
In sharp words, he had encountered a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil and our Ilkay born and grown up in Germany.
They excluded them from this society because they were able to photograph with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the Domain.
Honestly, I could not devour it as her President that our two young men, who have risen up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, as opposed to Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" by photos of the two Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to face players in the future.
That someone says, if I win, I am Germaner when I lose, I am migrant - that is not possible.
"I regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for the return of Özil to the National Team.
As a follow-up, an additional integral representative will now be called in addition to the born Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there's one without a migration background that clearly affects society and football and says, "The topic is important, then we have to take care of," that would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our local associations where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Özil Affair, he wants to re-advocate the Office as President of DFB in the next year.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it is," said Grindel.
Annuals build three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As the police report, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 p.m.
First, the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady at the red amp in the area of Lauter Height.
It told the pensioner he would have driven against her car.
However, there was no exchange of staff since the 75-year-old could not find the lady at the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a car driver who had come away from the road and rided against a guidepower.
That's what the man did not want a policeman on the ground, and then he drove out of it.
Afterwards, the Red Taler went home.

Finally, the police could find him and stop him.
His car revealed significant accidental damage.

The damage is approximately EUR 1300.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Nearly 1000 forces still in use.

This told the Federal Army on Sunday.
As the situation of a speaker continues to develop stablely, the last 70 honorable helpers were deducted.

SPD politicians: John Kahrs marries his friend
John Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for everyone, the politician has married his long-term friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs has married his long-term friend Christoph Rohde.
The two gave the yaword on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not come into question for her, Kars had said before the "Image" magazine.
If we marry, then right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budgetary speaker of the SPD Friday fraction and one of the seaheimer’s speakers, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Federal Day debate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had aroused with an indignant view on June 30, 2017.
Thus, he had pretended Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "rolled" himself in the topic.
"That was your Shabowski-Moment," he said in reaction to the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, equal pairs can marry just like heterosexuals.
In the past they had been able to enter their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the law of adoption.

Switzerland starts electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and to eliminate family members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be taken only with express consent, stresses Swiss transplant.
(dpa) Switzerland starts an electronic register for organ donors on Monday.
This is intended to facilitate organ donations and to eliminate family members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the event of death can be registered there.
Your wishes are then available in the case of Swiss transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs continue to be taken - as in Germany - only with express consent, Swiss transplant stresses.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss people have a donation certificate, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a map is found at the decisive moment for possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the dead one.
"Then you have to decide deputy in the sense of the deceased, what is often very burdensome," says Always.
A similar registration system already exists in the United Kingdom.
In Germany there is consideration to store information on possible donation of organs on the hospital card, as the speaker of the Federal Center for Health Information, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A register in which people can enter their wishes - per or contrast organ donation - there is not," she says.
Federal Minister for Health, Jens Spahn, has spoken for a new system of organ donations.
According to his proposal, each person would first be considered an organ donor unless he or his family contradicts.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in the head count
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion.
He sat on the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 fellow struggles.
Martina Flamme-Jasper informed this on Sunday from the Science Museum Phaeno, the exhibition site of the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel greeting from Germany occupied the third place.
The latest WM participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest one 74-year-old pensioner from France, as the principal judge Ralf Laue said.
The data professor from Zwickau, Saxony, organises competition every two years.
For example, previous tasks were: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants addressed guests from the audience with laptops.
Wenzel greeting from lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while telling.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Two years ago, as 14-year-olds were present in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superhern, genius or miracle kid, organizer loue can start little.
"He said, "He can be trained."
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even competitors targeted in stages.
One of the disciplines, for example, is to draw the square root from six-digit numbers.
When calculating multinationality, the candidates receive surprising tasks for which they need to find a solution strategy quickly.
Here the Germans would also have good chances, said the chief judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage because there are more intensive and effective methods learned in the early childhood.

Polare Cold Air brings new snow to the mountains in the West
Ms Holle shakes her beds in the west for the first time next week: Polare Cold Air reaches Monday Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG) at the beginning of the week, the snow limit falls to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in tight valleys it could snow down to about 1,000 meters, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the high dues, 20 to 40 inches [40 cm] of new snow should be estimated above 2,000 meters.
On higher roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelblick, Bielerhöhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions will therefore be winterful.
Farmers may start with the annual breaking care on Monday
Sleswig-Holstein's farmers may start with the annual breaking care on Monday.
The unique "green forests" in Germany have been the landscape of the waldarm country for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide wood and spray hooks are "wave rate" and for many animals and plants the last withdrawal rooms.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered living spaces on which the exchange of organisms can still work, as the manager of the Nature Protection Association of Germany (NABU) said in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living teeth
The Knicks were laid on the basis of a command from the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living teeth" were not only field limitation and livestock, they also provided farmers with wood and bars for their specialized houses.
From that time, his name is "Knick": by "umbling" the axes were able to develop the dense, flooded boundaries.
Today, between the North and the Eastern Sea, about 45 000 kilometres of the hills extends and gives the picture of a wooden, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used as a replacement space for some 7000 animal species.
In a kilometre of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and bread up to 30 bird pairs.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is maintained accordingly in the winter.
In other words, he declines to a light tree series, which, in addition to the variety of species, also reduces the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the cnickcare must be operated only outside the time of breach between October and March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about local situation
The local radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the Tsunami:
Were you on site during the Tsunamis itself?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I then learned about the Tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours of car, since the airport was closed at the time at Palu.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport, so that there can also be auxiliary goods.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast that were all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we also brought other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many are driven to surrounding hills, on which they still endure in fear of another Tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their houses, there are still descendants.
Because many food businesses and also the tank stations are fully closed, people claw food and petrol partly.
The public service has been completely shut down, the national government helps out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners are partly running free and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island running?
At the moment we have a phone reception, but before it didn't work and we got information only via radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people of whom they do not know whether they live and where they stay because people were not at home during the earthquakes, but, for example, on their way to work.
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information about this?
We don't know why, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no Tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions, which were not met by the Tsunami, there was the failure to know that a tsunami hits the region and they have been driven to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, which is on the Pacific fire ring, not prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure is collapsed, the earthquake has met many people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI Survey in Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned inquiries is strongly limited.
With an FBI investigation in the Turbot tempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the hauch thin majority for the judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh controversial claims.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a period until Friday to inform the more than 30 years of disappointing events.
The recent turn in the drama about the call Kavanaughs, accompanied by a cultural struggle, had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the lawyer argues against the oppositional democrats, the Senate Jurisdiction Committee should free the way for the final confirmation of the arch conservative judge at the Supreme Court of the United States.
The majority of the Republicans seemed to be assured when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demand an FBI investigation.
After tumultous scenes, his party friends were willing to enter.
President Trump, who had still called the heavy speeches on Thursday as "decision", first had further attacks on women and spoke, contrary to "Happy in the accident".
In this way, last doubt could be eliminated, he said.
Later, Tromp attacked the Democrats sharply at a election, because they rejected Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump orders FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh

There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 to win against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The lighting on shalke is great after the first season.
However, the factor time played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, Christian Heidel is well known for football games as a huge pessimist.
This was not different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our violation room," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
Finally, the king's blue man had still succeeded in bringing the nearly 1:0 against the Rhines over the time and thus the first seasonal victory under roof and field.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership of Alessandro Crew 11 of the Chieftrainer Domenico Tedesco had given security: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and pressing.", it is evident that with increasing playtime, the head played an increasing role.
Doesn't actually create a headball uncovered
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "If the team was just half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, so they continued to withdraw.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three numerators of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Creator, who did not have an inconsistent share in it with his headball meeter: "I am actually the worst headball player in the manship."
But at the end, only the victory.
The facilitation was noticeable in the entire arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start printing in the initial phase and make a fireworks of it," said Schalkes Chief Coach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we'll be happy for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the crew and the fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and courageous, so we have to go to parties over 90 minutes
The probably largest manco of the afternoon: King's blue missed to worry rather for clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, e.g. through the strong Yevhen Conpplyanka, who hit the latte twice 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a triumph," Tedesco said, "you've already felt a little fear."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only schalker.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye height
In front of them, the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafalani.
He has been followed for the repeated time of the invitation by Ernst Reiling and Lore housechild.
"I have made it my task for many years to get interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Meeting" - that association cooperating in the orientation of the evening with the "cultural policy" alliance.
El-Mafaalani is getting more easily into reading, describes the writing process of the book, speaks about how difficult it was to explain the subject understandably.
With a lot of gestures, hand-fast numbers and some joke, he brings the listeners closer to one of the most conflict-rich topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts growing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author is used to answer the question of a metapher.
On one table, the German society, on the cat-cent table, sits on the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they were always sitting at the big table and want to decide now.
This leads to conflicts.
Decisively, then, is not whether one orders himself to the right or to the left, but, "I am for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first, rather behavior, then more and more the discussions are going on.
And there is a need to speak.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they have succeeded or failed to see integration in students.
El-Mafaalani stands for, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is at eye height.
Sociology Professor does not urge his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not of individual destiny halls.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "only when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Maphalani.
Even during the following time of signing, he was still an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, intensely discussed in prepared Kurdish specialities.

So Schalkes Naldo "great sport" also succeeds on the bank
For the third time not in the bootlf: Yet, Naldo thanks to Schalke Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time in succession, not in the Schalker Startlf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding of many people would have been great if the nearly two meters large Brazilians had spoken the fruit of the soul once as correctly.
But after the 1:0 victory of the FSV Mainz 05, when the Schalker players gathered together in the middle circle and thanked the Chief Coach Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old who all calls the simple half of Naldo and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who, despite his new reserveist, did not hold any grill.
Probably, Naldo, who was celebrated during the last season as the best shalker, knows that he has actually not been shot with his trainer - but is given a break for good reasons.
A reason called "load control".
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I tell you very honestly," said Tedesco about the moment when he had told Naldo that he wasn't standing at the start.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the association," Tedesco justified the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can get through at present.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that last caught Naldo.
And the Brazilians reacted to them with the wisdom of his advanced age: he also proved to be an exemplary team player on the bank.
The atmosphere in Austria's industry has continued to accelerate its valley in August compared to the Eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month depth.
However, in Europe, Austria has the third-best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute informed on Monday of its survey under 3,000 companies.
Unlike Austria, the PMI of the Eurozone increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still the 13th month in a row below the brand of 50 counters that represent growth.
In August, only Ireland's industry knocked this threshold with 50,9 points.
Finally light were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index with 44.0 points reached the highest level since March.
"The slightly weakened valley journey could mean that the worst thing has passed," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, in the third quarter, the industry remains growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not visible: the export contracts in the eurozone have not fallen as much as since November 2011.
Consequently, the companies built off the seventh month in a row of posts.
In China, industry production also decreased more than initially in August.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts first expected 47.8 points.
The purchase manager index bases its figures on representative surveys by 3,000 European industrial companies.
The developments in turnovers, employment, stocks and prices are raised, among other things.
