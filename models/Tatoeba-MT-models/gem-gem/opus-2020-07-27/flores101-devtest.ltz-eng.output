And in the savann it is to cover a prime with a digestive system like that of humans, its ambient needs with the available planting resources.
Additionally, there is a grave consequence if you do not: malnutritional depression, lack of learning, and ultimately death.
All the easiest accessible planting resources would be proteins and leaves and warmlines, but they'd be diluted for primes as we're hard to tell if they weren't watched.
In Yigesaz, there is also a desire for proteins that contain all of these moments of imagination.
Everything and everything shouldn't be surprised if we'd have solved the same type of protein problem in our experience as shimpans doing in the savanne today.
