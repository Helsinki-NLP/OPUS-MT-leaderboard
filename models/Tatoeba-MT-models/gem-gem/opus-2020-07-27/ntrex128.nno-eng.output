Walish members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently disappointed by a proposal to re-name the assembly member or AM (Member of the Welsh Parliament) to member of the Walisian Parliament or MWP.
The reaction was due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Walisian Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned about being ridiculated.
A member of Labour said that his group is concerned with your ‘MWP rimar on Twp and Pwp’
For readers outside Wales: In Walisian, “twp” means foolish and “pwp” besj.
A member of the Plaid Party said that the group 'not necessity' and proposed options.
A Walisian Conservative member said that his group has an "open mind" in the case of the change of name, but added that MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the valley letter w is not different from the English Yorkshire dialekt's statement of the letter u.
The National Assembly’s delegation, which now writes legislative proposals to introduce the change of name, said: ‘The final decision whether the members of the national assembly will, of course, be up to the members themselves.’
A Walisian official decision from 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the proposals for names which demonstrated great support for calling the Assembly of the Wallis Parliament.
In the case of the title of national parliamentary members, the delegation prefers the Walisian parliamentary member or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support under the public hearing.
The members of the National Assembly may have come with other proposals, but the struggle to be some has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, the main work.
The legislation of the reforms includes other changes to the functioning of the delegation, including rules on discvalification of members of the assembly and the design of a committee system.
Members of the Assembly will be able to vote on their name when they debate the legislative proposal.
Macedonians are telling people to change the country's name
On Sunday, the choosers shall speak whether to change their country's name to 'The Republic of North Macedonia'.
People's destruction was determined to solve a conflict that has occurred for decades with the neighbouring country Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement for the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia’s requests for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president Gjorge Ivanov, a opponent of the folk's resolution on the change of name, said he's going to look away from the result.
Those who support the demolition, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The Clocks of St. Martin stand while the churches of Harlem, New York, struggling
"The old ones I've spoken to said that in old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
‘Today there is none of the parts.’
He said he understands why the bares disappear.
“The people socialise in other ways to date”, he said.
‘Bars are no longer stuck in the neighborhood that people visit normally.’
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the property is not going to stay as long as the leaders believe, "and before or afterwards they are back where they started."
He added that churches could be replaced by participants filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historical places of the neighborhood.
"The majority of those who buy participants in these buildings are white," he said. "and this is the day when all the churches are being sworn, because it is not likely that these people who move into the participants will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white socks before Harlem became a black city - Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin Church a decade later.
The original white methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black sock that had preached nearby moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black sock leased by pastor John Howard Johnson, who also directed the boikot of the shops in 125th Street, a main handman in Harlem where the owners were opposed to admitting or promoting blacks.
The building got great damage in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson's followers planned to rebuild him, they also ordered a new watch game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and descendant of St. Martin, was proud and called the watch game "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the watch game in July calls it something else: "A cultural tax" and "an historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also commented that it was the first watch game in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play on the larger watch game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin in the last months has become a complicated story of architects and building workers, some of them added by the leaders of the church's toys, and others of the episcopal bispedum.
The Sacrist, who leads the soccer and consists of the leaders of the toys, wrote to the Bishop in July with concern that the Bishop “will ask the sacrist to pay”, even though the sacrist was not involved in the bishop’s addition of architects and building workers.
Some of the members of the soccer complain about the lack of openness from the bispedum.
13-year-old harm damage under hummar thickness in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for humms in California on the opening day of the hummar season.
Just before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on KSWB TV in San Diego that he had diving with friends in about a half-hour Saturday morning when he heard that the boy cried for help. He paddled to the gut with a group and pulled out of the water.
Hammel said first he thought he was just excited to have caught a hummare, before he realized that the boy cried out 'no bite me!
Someone bite me!»
"Heal his bone was ripped off," said Hammel that he observed when he reached the gut.
"I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was picked up by air ambulance and taken to Rady hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's uncertain what kind of shark it was like attacking the good.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that shark wasn't a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the gut had serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities linked access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there were more than 135 different species of hai in the area, but most people are not supposed to be dangerous.
Sales Chain Sainsbury's bets on beauty product
The British shop chain Sainsbury's shall compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenham's beauty product and offer storm gas in the shop.
As part of an investment in the United Kingdom, its beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow while fashion and interior sales fall, Sainsbury's will test their beauty product in 11 shops next year, and more shops if it becomes a success.
The investment in the beauty product comes at a time when the shelfs used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are empty.
Sainbury's said they should double the number of beauty product to 3000 products and offer the trademarks Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They must give the brand L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each mark, such as in the Boots shops.
The shop shall also relaunch its own sminke series of Boutique and make most of the products vegan, attracting several young customers.
In addition, the parfume negotiator Fragrance Shop shall test the hall of his parfumes in two of the Sainsbury shops. The first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Action online and a change towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small stores means that large shop chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, Managing Leader of Sainsbury's, has commented that the shops will look more and more like the stormagasin, while the shop chains are trying to fight the low-cost shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has joined the interior chain Argos in hundreds of shops and introduced several Habitat shops, since they bought up both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the food sal and thus defended the purchase.
The former attempt of the shop chain to renew the beauty and pharmaceutical departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but this ended when the parties didn't get some about how to share the profits of the pharmacies in shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's selling pharmaceutical chain Celesio, who had 281 pharmaceuticals and owned the pharmaceutical chain of Lloyds, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyd's still has a role in playing and to offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including the marks La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how the beauty shelves will look and be experienced to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also entrusted colleagues with special skills to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed so that they fit all needs, while the attractive environment and the practical positions mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way to act."
Peter Jones ‘wonderful’ after Holly Willoghby withdraws from the agreement worth £11 million
The stars from the TV program Dragons Den, Peter Jones, are “wonderful” after the TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an agreement with his lifestyle mark, £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to promote their Truly interior and accessory mark.
The couple's collaboration has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark.
The host of this morning program, 37, made new-handed knowledge of Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the stars from Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the middle of the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "rassing" when the golden Holly confessed during a strangered meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of Jones' business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly has its new contracts - the world up to £1.5 million - means that she no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and accessory label Truly.
The collaboration has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop mark and was assumed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make known that she was not working with Truly, while Jones escaped the United Kingdom to calm down in one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was absolutely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long-term plan for the future, and it would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one thought his own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for the hall.»
Experts believe that this Morning host, one of the richest stars in the United Kingdom, can cost the company millions because of intense investment in product, from puts to light to clothing and interior, and may cause delays in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, has been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly together with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the Chairman of March.
Para holidays together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become M&S mark ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV programme I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said yesterday night, "We don't comment on his business."
Heavy conversations “and then we love”
He was ridiculous about the criticism he came to get from the media to come with a comment some could experience as "upresident" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Said Trump with his customs office as "newness speaker".
‘I haven't given up.’
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump calls a great step towards the disarmament of the nuclear weapons programme in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the nuclear weapons programme have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the High Diploma from North Korea Ri Yong Ho said to the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not receive a ‘similar response’ from the United States, in the course of the early disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he added, continued the United States with penalties to press North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"There's awesome between us and North Korea," he said.
"We were going to go into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He suggested that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results -- the end of rocket testing, help to release gigs and the return of leasing to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual procedure in relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10 000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," said Trump and pointing to the group standing before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy the island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign auxiliary organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lombok had to flee, no one declared a national crisis situation, which is necessary for international emergency assistance.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they do not want international help, so that's a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Redd Barna set up a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to add with foreign passports to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman of the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that the authorities assess the situation in Palu in order to examine international organisations for the right to provide necessity assistance.
Although Indonesia is often exposed to earthquake, the country is not specially prohibited for natural forces.
In the Aceh area they have built access rooms for tsunamia, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Trass warnings against tsunamia in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian is usually quite challenging.
Natural catastrophes make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was for the cai in Lombok to treat those who were injured in the earthquake is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the involvement of the infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration to be President Joko, and next year there is a choice again.
President Joko is also pressed when it comes to sektary tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have accepted his conservative threat.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christians and Muslim gangs struggled in the streets and used makeets, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.

The Statute of Parliament of Cromwell becomes the last victim of the “recretion of history”
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England as his puritan followers did during the Citizen War in the 16th century.
However, the Cromwell Association describes Crick's proposal to remove the statue as "noise" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the debate on the removal of statues in question that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm during the English Citizen War was ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe error Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his forefather, Thomas, in the centuries before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is proof of public meanings in the 19th century, and is part of the historicalography of a figure that many still seem to be worth celebrating.»
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was obviously against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not, a discussion is still a matter of historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 16th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of that distinguishing.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.’
Killing pig attack and kill Chinese pawn
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a Southwest China market, following local media reports.
The man, with the surname Yuan, was found dead, with cut pulse years and covered with blood, near a pig binge on the market in Liupanshui, the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig bond prepares to give pigs vaccines on a garden on 30 May, 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin's dead, and discovered that the gate of one of the piglings was open.
He said that in the bench there was a big mangris with blood around his mouth.
The obduct showed that a 250 pounds heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"The bones of my cousin were bloody and devastated," said the cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
Monitor camera shows that Yuan came to the market at 04:40 on Thursday to eat the pigs.
His similarity was found about an hour later.
The animal he killed, didn't listen to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence of the site.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the leader of the market.
Although it is rare, such attacks from pigs have happened before.
In 2016 a pig went to attack a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, and gave the man serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a 205 pounds [295 kg] of heavy pig a Walisian pawn caught between herself and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon was one of his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive for usual, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
"You just want to play.
They like biting, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just need to have enough respect for them," he said.

Rosa had wind power up to 136 km/h and was an orchestra of category 1 until 05:00 in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the orchestra centre was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa will move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, there is a low pressure over the Pacific that moves east to the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes closer to the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical moisture north to the south-west US.
Rosa will bring up to 25 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 cm rain can create dangerous flows and possible landscapes in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to rain between 5 and 7 inches per hour in some parts of the Southwest U.S.E., especially in parts of the southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 cm rain is expected in parts of the southwest US; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous flows may occur due to spread terrain and tropical rain.
It is warned against tours in the desert to the foot because of the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can make clowns to flowing rivers and lightning and thunderstorms will bring strong wind and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
The total rainfall of more than 1 cm is possible, which can create small flows and smooth roads.
This will be the first rain town for the season in the region.
Spreaded tropical rain towns will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain rises slowly on Monday and Tuesday.
Four Corners region can wait a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October can witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic becomes colder, but tropical strokes will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The next days, the late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Many of Central and Eastern USA are expected to experience a warm beginning in October, with 25 degrees and upwards from the southern part of the large planes to parts of the Northeast US.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.

More than 20 million people look at Brett Kavanaugh high
On Thursday, more than 20 million people at Brett Kavanaugh's testimony saw in the U.S. Supreme Court and Woman who was responsible for sexual attacks in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different TV channels.
At the same time, the political discussion around the matter continued, with interruptions in the usual TV programs of different broadcasting companies to reveal the last new hands on Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the debts in the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh felt her when he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a senseful decline, he's 100 percent sure that it doesn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw dismissed on Friday, following Nielsen.
The company reached this figure by finding the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The numbers were not clear from other channels showing the right, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
The Nielsen also has trouble counting watchers from the office.
To put this in perspective, there are a similar number of viewers who look at an American football final or Oscar distribution.
Fox News's hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, said Nielsen.
ABC was in the second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
People are still interested after the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
When Flake, a moderate Republican, declared that he was on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants cried after him on his way to a hearing with a Judge Committee on Friday.
He stood and looked at the ground for several minutes while the Protestants cheated on him at CNN live.
"I stand here right in front of you," said a woman.
'Do you believe he tells the truth to our country?'
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office has declared himself, and before he went into his lift, he said he wanted more to say under the committee.
The broadcasting agency showed the hearing on TV when the Judgment Committee was going to speak for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to full Senate and further odour.
But Flake said he could only do that if the FBI investigated the claims against Kavanaugh in the next week, which the Democrats also asked.
Flake was somewhat convinced by talking to his friend, democrat and senator Chris Coons.
After speaking with Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake decided.
Flake's decisive proved to have power, because it was clear that the Republicans couldn't speak for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation of the complaints against Kavanaugh.

Police disturbs with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the Voice of Independence
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrating the suspensive noise together with police forces, and thousands of other demonstrators protested against self-steady one year after the release of any release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powder layers that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
The collision also broke out later on the day, and the police used batons to prevent eskalation.
For several hours, the separatists cried “Don’t forget, forgive” while the Protestants cried to self-employed, “Long live Spain.”
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for small damage after the protests.
Atmosphere is still pressed in the region and many will still have self-employed one year after the 1st October resolution, which was called illegal by Madrid but were celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most choosers spoke for self-employed, but there was also low electoral participation among those who were against self-employed and boikotta Voice.
Following the Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were damaged last year after the police tried to prevent the resolution and elective disaster occurred in the region.

However, the demonstration went out of the stack, but it had to take another path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests together with his wife, said that he no longer has hope of self-employed in Catalonia.
"The last time we experienced one of our best-looking moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy to be able to voice for self-employed, but now we sit firm again," he said.
Even though they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who are too independent to keep their power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while waiting for the jurisdiction of their role in the organisation of the resolution and the subsequent self-state declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was upset by politicians on both sides.
"The tension increases more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been part of the ongoing proceedings since last year, declared that he was going to make elections in the European Parliament next year.
"Stilling as a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the oppression that we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.

Menga-shot gives Livingston 1-0-sights over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston Suppliers says
Definite Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second speaker after 18 struggles training the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's side smoothed with Hibernian in others.
Gerrard's side has no winners in the Scottish Premiership League this season, and will play against Hearts, which they have eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Ranger's hosthood of Rapid Vienna in the European League will be Thursday.
Livingston has six winners in a row, and the main trainer Holt has still not lost since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses the chances of disappearing the layer
Holt's team should have rented long before they scora, and created several problems for Rangers with the direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low efforts to achieve goals, which made Alan Lithgow have to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett his heading over the target.
The home team was naked to let Rangers play ahead of them, well knowing that they could create trouble for the removal team.
And that's how the decisive goal became scora.
Rangers joined a free park and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went to Menga, who took a touch and scora from the middle of the penalty area.
Before then Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and the Liam Kelly keeper was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forces Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow flicked far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passports were sent forward and back in the Livingston penalty field, while two punishments - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hands - were vibrated away.
'Fenomenal' from Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont in Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal struggle and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played amazing and still impresss the curve upwards.
The style of their game and players has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks is going to Holt for the way he shocked since he became a trainer.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense and organized a defense at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the battle.
Rangers were unmotivated.
But as good as they've been under Gerrard, they weren't good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and only cut up half of the home once, which should make Rangers realize that they won't get up anymore.
Erdogan may mix welcome in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday 29 September in Berlin.
It's the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
Countries have been disagreeable when the role of human rights, freedom of press and Turkey in the EU is in place.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a big new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevent an over 25 000 people from gathering up above the mosque because of "security causes," but many of Erdogan's supporters met to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also met to condemn Erdogan's policy and the German State's deciding to welcome him in the country.
The double Protestants reflected the difference between German Turkish people, who view Erdogan as one whole, and others, who view him as an autocracy.

Orca Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood (for the benefit of the dry area)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is just such a weather phenomenon that is on the way to Arizona early next week, in which the rest of the orchestra Rosa moves south-west over the desert and creates fear of flood.
The national weather service has expired with warnings against the flood on Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona and south and eastern Nevada, southeast Californien and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is waiting to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give rain already late Monday.
The national weather service in Phoenix twitra that only "three tropical cyclons have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra that reached 60 miles within the Arizona border.»
The last models from the National Orcan Centre report between 5 and 10 cm rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona.
It can calculate between 2 and 5 cm in other areas of the south-west desert, including central parts of Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated total amounts up to 10 cm.
For areas outside the fluid risk, Rosa may be a blessing in the dry.
Although the flood is a serious concern, it is likely that this counted area will be useful in the south-west US which is exposed to drying.
Sequential drying monitors in the United States are extreme droughts in more than 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest dry category, reports weather.com.
First, the orchestra Rosa will move over the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of more than 135 miles per hour, Rosa is on Sunday morning 619 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves northward at a speed of 19 miles per hour.
The storm meets colder water in the Pacific and is calming down.

«Regn between 7 and 15 cm is expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, possibly up to 25 cm,» reported weather.com.
Rosa will draw northwards along Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull up through Arizona and into south-Utah Tuesday night.
"The largest danger of Rosa or the remainder of it is a lot of rain in Baja California, north-west-Sonora, and the US South-West Desert," said the National Orcan Centre.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening flows in desert area and landscape in mountain areas.

Trump says Kavanaugh ‘lidde’ under the ‘smart and sinful’ democrats were against him
"Every voice for the Judge of Kavanaugh is a voice against the merciless and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats," said Trump under a rally in Wheeling, Western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has “littled” during the ‘smart and sinful’ democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a witness to the Congress on Thursday, refusing emotionally for the debt of Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked her sexually several decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified her debts during her hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the "American people got to see how brilliant and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
"Every voice to Cavanaugh's Judge is a voice to one of the best lawyers in our day, a lawyer with unfair service in the public," he said to a lot of followers in West Virginia.
The President also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to praise in the intermediate elections in the United States.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don't stand, but I really do,' he said.
"That's why I'm going around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats are looking for ‘resisting and blocking.’
The first important revelation of the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to happen last Friday, said a Republican representative of CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, speaking on dead increases
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken from huge waves on the beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami frames the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to take part in a festival on the beach of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters tall, hit the beach at sunset, and took many people while they destroyed everything they came over.
The tsunami came after a earthquake with a strength of 7.5.
“When the warning of tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not go immediately and they were victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the crisis relief agency in Indonesia GDP, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami was not enough in itself, he drove cars, tribes, houses; he framed everything on land," said Nugroho, and suggested that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea in a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climb into wood to avoid tsunami and survive in this way.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photo from the air published by the crisis agency shows many corrupted buildings and stores, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Continued hitting the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquake could be merged in the area around, with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Office for Testing and Testing Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the nuclear bomb over Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the Agency.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘wide’ and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of those who died have been found during the rest of the collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were damaged and 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and the size of the destructions may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the devil.
"We haven't heard anything from Donggala, the communication is cut," said Nugroho.
‘More than 300 000 people cages there’, said the Red Cross, encouraging their adding and volunteers on their way to the prevailing areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse," said the Red Cross.
On Saturday, the crisis agency was criticized not to inform that a tsunami had hit Palu, even though the authorities said that waves came before the noticed period.
A amateur video divided by social media shows a man in the top floor of a building that cries desperately to people down the streets to warn them against the coming wave.
Get minutes later hit a wall of water the coast, and bring buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the video with the first.
The shield and tsunami caused power breaks and cutting the communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate necessities.
The military has started the process of sending cargo aeroplanes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reports the authorities, but refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The airports in the city were reopened to accept emergency aid but will continue to be swept until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo would visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in Indonesia exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
They added to the World Vision from Donggala have come safely to Palu City, and have set up tents in their backyard to their office. On the way to the city, the totally destroyed areas passed, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many corrupted houses," he said.
It's very bad.
While negotiating organisations begin to help those who have suffered from tsunami, some complain that foreign negotiators with crisis-management expertise have been refused to enter Palu.
Following Indonesian law, foreign auxiliary organisations and their additions can not start the work before Indonesia has declared that the area is a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"There is a crisis at province level," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
‘When the State says ‘OK, this is a national crisis’, we can open for international emergency aid, but they have not updated the status yet.’
It's evening again in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, and friends and families of those who are still missing hope still on a miracle, but know that such natural disasters don't end well.
On Saturday a little good was saved from the clothes.
On Sunday, a woman was saved from the rest of a collapsed building, where she had a doctor captive next to the dead mother say for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paraglidars from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Monday said that some of those caught in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my emotional burden to bear on," he said.
Gendon told us that he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu paraglidars, who had participated in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only one gray hake, instead of two blue hacks.
"I think that means that the messages did not appear," he said.

Kanye West: The Rappar renames Ye
The Rapper Kanye West renames - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, and wrote: "The creation of former known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came right before he was going to act at Saturday night live, where he was waiting to drop his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the songer Ariana Grande on the show after she canceled for "emotional reasons," said the program host.
In addition to being a abbreviation of his current artist's name, West has earlier said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe the word "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it's us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye-- to reflect the good we do, the bad things we do, our confusing, everything.
The album reflects on who we are.’»
Canye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with the former West, has also changed the typing style of the name with and without sticky lines and uppercase letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country will soon mark the 50-year memory for the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he should ‘never use the military to suppress the Mexican people’.
On October 2, 1968, the military shot on peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, in a time when left-oriented students spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support for students and opening more free universities.
He has said that job solutions and lack of access to education have led youths to join criminal groups.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence
Since China works more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after different parts of the U.S. government declared artificial intelligence, even though the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"Every double of the budget for researching artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough of artificial intelligence," said Lee.
A double in funding can double the chances that the next major breakthrough of artificial intelligence happens in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month through the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that hit the highest ranked player of the game Othello, and later he worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was president of Google in China.
Lee recognized former technology competitions organised by the U.S. State, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked what time the next competition will be, so that he will join and identify the next visionars.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have bought excellent students from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen the research on artificial intelligence.
‘I thought that doctoral students before artificial intelligence should have automatic residence rights,’ he said.
The Chinese Government published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Association of Natural Sciences finances students at academic institutions, not different from the U.S. National Science Association and other government organisations' way of distributing money to American scientists, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Defence Ministry established a common center for artificial intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academy, and the White House declared the formation of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on the legislative proposals on national security and artificial intelligence in several months.
Macedonians are telling people to change the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum whether they should rename the Republic of North Macedonia to solve a decade-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a requirement in their territory and has used veto to vote against the membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change of name can undermine the ethnic identity of the slave majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he shouldn't speak in the destruction of the people, and a boikott has seen doubts about how far the destruction is going to reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question at the public destruction seat is: ‘Do you agree with NATO and EU membership and the agreement with Greece?’
Aid players for the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the change of name is worth membership of the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independently after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to speak for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so they can live freely under the paraply of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the resolution is not binding by law, an adequate number of members of Parliament has said that they will follow the result of the resolution to make it decisive.
In order to make the renewal, Parliament needs two-thirds to be dismantled.
The government election committee reported that nothing had happened unusually before 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voted, in contrast to 34 percent in previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered choosers voted.
"I speak to my children, we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a chooser in the capital, Skopje.
The Minister of State of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko spoke in Strumica in the revelation of Macedonia for whether to rename and open to join the NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boikott of the destruction before Parliament in Skopje by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Minister Zaev has said that membership of the NATO will attract investors to Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent labour solution.
"I believe that the majority will vote for the change, of which 80 percent of our citizens will be members of the EU and the NATO," said Zaev after speaking.
He said that a yes result could be interpreted as a "verifying the future spring".
A measurement of meaning last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of the electorates will participate in the reconciliation, which is below the required figure.
Another meaning measurement of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of the choosers plan to voice on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said 70 percent came to yes.
In order to close the degradation, at least 50 percent must be voiced, plus one voice.
If the destruction is not closed, it may harm the policy of the left-oriented government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero navigates through the Brighton Defence and Scorar
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecka Brighton defense that led to 2-0 victories for Manchester City on Saturday in the Etihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, when he scored for 65 minutes.
The Argentine sphere accepted a passion on the middle path at the beginning of the sequence.
He crashed over three Brighton defence players and reached the open path.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defense, before he ran through several others at the edge of the Brighton penalty field.
He came past a passion on the left and found Sterling.
The English spice used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, which used the right foot to hit the Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the target.
‘Aguero was still wearing the feet’, said the City Trainer Pep Guardiola to reporter.
"We talked that he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scora when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave the heaven-blue the first advantage of the Premier League battle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero accepted the ball deep in the Brighton territory.
He kicked the ball in a beautiful way along the left end of the course of Leroy Sane.
Sane held on the ball while leasing Sterling to the target.
The sky blue tip sparked the ball into the target just before he swallowed out of the path.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group phase at 12:55 on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play spoils against Rockies in American baseball
With Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high instinct of competition, and hopes to take the "mound" on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to "playoff" for Rockies, who leads with one game over Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies water at least 5-2 against the National Friday night, but they look forward to locking the first division title.
"Even if we don't play for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the second team as most likely to play at the highest level so far this year.
Who does not want to play with such relationships?»
It's still uncertain who's going to start in Nationals on Sunday, but it may be that of Scherzer to "pitche".
Scherzer, which then starts for the 34th time, throws a "bulb session" on Thursday and shall "pitche" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, coming from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2,53 ERA and 300 ‘stretchouts’ in 220 2/3-’innings’ this season.
Trump collects choosers in West Virginia
The President referred in an obsolete way to his first election for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while he talked about the importance of the Republicans to vote in the Middle Chamber in the United States.
"All we've done so far is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't put it, but I ran around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see that it happens right now.
And they're convinced that they're definitely going to take their power back, you see how foolish they are, how foolish they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we shall not give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and block."
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, and he called the Democrats "since and bad and ugly and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who got his audience to bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you play documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting - it was really bad body language - the worst body language I've seen.»
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant to those who say what they're mine.
When the momentum-activists in my local party spoke to censure me, it wasn't surprising.
I'm the last one in a series of Labour MPs who's been told that I'm not welcome -- just to say what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way because she protested against anti-Semittism.
In my case, I was criticized to be disagreeable with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it was important to drive responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar themes that Jeremy ironically did not agree with former leaders.
In the invitation to the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it was said “we want to meet to be inclusive and productive.”
In my last eight years, the Labour MP has a Friday girl would be just like that.
Individually, today's meeting was not like this, and the 'sniller' policy promise is longer forgotten, if it was at all followed.
It has become more and more evident that different views are not tolerated in Labour and that each meaning is condemned by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became a partial leader, when colleagues I used to be politically agreed with suddenly expecting me to re-determine and agree on matters I would never agree to -- whether it is about national security or the internal market in the EU.
When I speak publicly, it doesn't have anything to say what I say, I always get on social media and people want me to go out while they criticize central policy and say that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments on me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get gender discrimination and racist chikans directed at themselves every day, and who are still professional and do not leave.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period is the normalisation of political harassment.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should become more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. For each suggestion of mistrust and for each change in the party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I've received many advice for the past two years from people who have said I have to take it easy and not be so loud, so people may want to "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join the policy.
When I joined Labour, when I still went to school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry with Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was about to fall together, so I would have better public services for those who need them most -- whether it was like a municipal adviser or government minister.
I have never hid my political meanings, nor in previous choices.
No one in Nottingham East may have doubted what I stand for and who of the current leaders I do not agree with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country attacks a Brexit that would harm private, local activities and public services, I don't understand why people care about throwing away energy to ask questions about my loyalty to the Labour party manager.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Uncomfortable Ayr goes to the top of the Scottish rugby
Two of his "tries" may change the result a little bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr was ignition to win in this very entertaining Tentent's Premiership fight today.
They are now on the top of the palm as the only inevitable one made of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defence and ability to take sjans that gave their home team and their trainer, Peter Murchie, good reason to be naked.
"We have been looked at tests in the last matches, and we are still invictorious, so I have to be naked," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Aur fortifies praise, they were better than us to take sans."
Grant Anderson had a "try" for 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a "conversion", which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland Captain Rory Hughes from Warriors let Melrose gather, and Jason Baggot took a "unconverted try".
Climo received a punishment just before the break, he scora and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try", which was "converted" by Baggot, reduced the ringing moon with five points.
There was a long break when Ruaridh Knott was seriously damaged and put on board, and from the restart Ayr went forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, like Climo "converted".
The working captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, received yellow cards, and again Melrose tried an unconverted Bruce Colvine try at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and then Struan Hutchinson got yellow cards to deal with Climo without the ball from the penalty, scora MacPherson a 'try'.
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent the "flanker" Gregor Henry away from his fifth "try".

‘Our Sea’: Bolivia hopes that the court will open the waterway to the Pacific
Sailors patrol maritime headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
Marine Bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazonaselva are covered with the motto: "Our Sea is ours. We have the right
and the obligation to return to it.’;»
In land locked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastal line of the country lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict of resources in the 18th century, longing for sailing again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades, while Bolivia is waiting for the judgment of the International Court to come on 1 October, after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has driven, calm and is united, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the judgment of the International Court, in the hope that the Court of Hague will support Bolivia's claims, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - gives Bolivia an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the carismatic native president of Bolivia - who strived to be elected again next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
"No, we will soon return to the Pacific," he promised late in August.
But some analysts don't think the Court will allow Bolivia to access the sea -- and that little would have changed if they got access.
The Netherlands-based United Nations Court has no power to transfer Chilen territory to Bolivia and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the judgment of the Court comes only six months after the last negotiations indicates that the case "not was complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
For the past four years, Bolivia's thing has long been done, they've done the opposite.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration’, said Zárate.
Morales, with her fighty retoric, has killed what was that of Chile's goodwill, meant Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the problem after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the Court was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile and a chance of ‘setting line at 139 years of disagreement and rather benefiting both of them’, he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America, used this maritime problem to win voices.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific”, he added.
"The judgment is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't dispose of nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday in the United Nations General Assembly.
He encouraged the United States to follow up to the elevation they gave during the meeting in Singapore between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come in a time when the U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart its locked nuclear guardiplomas, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean Leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will subject itself if the United States continues with penalties and resists any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington fights to agree with any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing it first.
Kim and the U.S. President, Donald Trump, will have a new meeting.
But many are critical to that Pyongyang is serious about the destruction and that the country most likely views their weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headaches are the last fashion on the way to a handheld near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you no longer need to guide.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a series of large and special headpieces in their SS19 collection. The main plague surprised the audience during the moteweek of Paris.
The highest unpractical hats can be seen at Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creatures right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent plague was a superb, beige Valentino-hat with a feather-like, at the brake that covered the models' heads.
There was also other over-dimensional accessories under the moth show, including a jewel-pryd washing melon, a magic man's hat, and even an ananas -- but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks - just in time before Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had lips that were sown together and similar more to Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One of the creations looks like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looks like a melted ice in cakes.
If you like this huge dramatic fashion, you can just glean.
Experiences that the huge hats come for halls in a handy near you.
The over-dimensional hats come right after "La Bomba", the strap hat with the 60-centimeter breeze that has been seen on the consciouss from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult trademark behind the highest unpractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk - a beach bag of the same size as the bikini-coated model that carried her.
Beachwash, with colour of burnt orange and frons the top with a white rail handle, was the most inclined part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the fashion week in Paris.
The Kennis-stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach cleaners in the moth shops next summer – the designer has made so much impression that I doubt that I can ignore the request for over-dimensional accessories.”
John Edward: Global citizens need language knowledge
Private school in Scotland is familiar with high academic levels, and this continued in 2018 with excellent exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and common success in sport, art, music and other societal actions.
With more than 30 000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Advisory Board for Sustainable Schools (SCIS), are working to offer the best services to the students and their parents.
Self-employed schools aim to prepare their students for advanced and higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular elections in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "Where you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, then the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can not only lie in English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
By viewing the results of this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest standing characters for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took abandoned language received A.
The data, which were collected from SCIS's 74 member school, shows that 72 percent of the students received A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that self-employed schools in Scotland support man-made languages such as vital characteristics, which children and young people will absolutely need in the future.
Languages to which elections are considered equivalent to STEM faga (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the course of independent schools and other places.
An investigation carried out by the British Selection for Addition and Features in 2014 showed that 17 percent of employers are seeking to fill jobs due to lack of language knowledge of the applicants.
Therefore, languages in school are increasingly important to prepare youths to work.
With multiple job capabilities for linguists, these features are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what kind of career a youth does, if they have learned a second language, they have a good advantage in the future with such a property.
In order to be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically benefit from a competitive value.
Following a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any other language than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language that was spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language training for our children.
Knowing more languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, there are different schools in the languages in which they teach.
Many schools focus on classic modern languages, while others teach languages classified as important in the United Kingdom when we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose between in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish self-employed schools are dedicated and want to create a teaching environment that will prepare children and give the properties they need to be closed, regardless of what future brings.
One cannot reject that in this global business-oriented environment, languages are vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the educational sector.
Modern languages should be called ‘international communication characteristics’.
Self-employed schools will continue to offer this choice, offering a lack of and high competence for Scotland's young people.
Il faut bee le faire.

LeBron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waitetida is soon over to fans who gleam to see LeBron James debut on the basketball team Los Angeles Lakers.
The Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-song game on Sunday, against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he's been playing has not yet been determined.
‘There will be more than one minute and less than 49’, Walton announced on the official website of Lakers.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, twist that James is most likely going to play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' timetable for the early season.
"I don't need a first-song game at this stage of the career to make me ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump starts with a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned stops the coming week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote on wait to choose to fill the vacant position of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the future mid-term elections since the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when voting in November.
What time should Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it on the Internet?
Trumps collection in Wheeling, West Virginia is planned for 19:00 tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump say West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to take up this week's hearings of the High Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited over debts on sexual abuse, with a expected confirmatory voice from the Senate waiting for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this cave of collections is to help the Republicans meet the November elections and get some moment (drivenness).
Thus, President Trump's campaign says that next week's five collections are entitled to "upgrade volunteers and trailers which the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of them in the Senate and the Representative House", followed by Reuters.
"Control of the Congress is so critical for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season," explains a spokesman of the Trump campaign who refuses to be informed to Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection to the evening can bring support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and subtract coverage from Pittsburgh media", followed by West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia republikan Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has been asked for the meaning measurements.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a lift in the meaning measurements," said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at the West Virginia University, following Reuters.
Cleaner Cup 2018: Team USA shows mage for fighting to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be like this Cleaner Cup-en force.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sport, but one that the players truly believe in, and never more than on competitions like these.
So where would they say that moment is now?
"They had a six-point lease, and now there's four, so we take it as a little moment," I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points lead to twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have some wind in their sails, and they have much to be encouraged by, not least for Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been mortal from tea to green and leasing by example.
The gutural shout of the celebration was higher when his round continued, searched for an important put to take four all-squao.re match when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His put as they won the battle of 15, were met with a similar shout, the type that tells you he thinks the American team isn't out of this.
"You've actually only had a deep grave and worry about your own struggle," said Spieh.
There is now all of these players left.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unconquestable history of Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange, but sweet couples are four from four and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who wouldn't shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a track with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
It's the race, and the way their energy seems to move both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, that they are the players to be hit on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European say when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Especially both at the same time on different holes.
Speaking of European honor is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did short work by Sergio Garcia, the morning fireball hero, when he was the couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, rough Spanish and Swedish into a hole they never came near to climb out.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursome are so fascinating to look at closely maintained because of the interaction between opponents, advice they give, and advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change on an eyelight.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lease in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the team of the United States has the stomach of the battle that somebody, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 rental in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after getting out of Saturday's four balls and foursome matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two winners over a fighting Tiger Woods to take his fight so far on Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European page invited to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a wrong American page tomorrow fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The United States added more opposition in foursomes and water two matches, but they could not get the undershot.
Jim Furyk's page needs eight points from the 12 single matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European smoke that wins four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a surprising weekend, are only the second couple who wins four points from their opening in four battles in the Clearer Cup history.
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in four-balls, they went so great to hit an outstanding Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with one even more desirable 5 and 4.
Woods, who slept through two battles on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who complained for the morning's fourballs, returned to the party Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not even get everything they wanted on a nice, blowed day southwest of Paris.
Three times, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas win the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a courageous 2 & 1 says about Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only two times in Clearer Cup history, a layer has come back from a four-point base and entered single, even though, as holders, Furyk's page needs to be drawn only to keep the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, it still looks like a Sunday attack will be outside them.
North Korea says that untrusted rusting is not going to occur
North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations on Saturday that if penalties continued, the mistrust of the United States will grow, and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho declared at the annual General Assembly of World Government that North Korea had done “significant measures” to improve relations in the last year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, demounted the nuclear test site and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't get anything like that back from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances it is not possible that we disarmament ourselves one-sidedly first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phase" approach to the dismantling of nuclear weapons, where the North Korean would be paid for gradual steps, his statements showed significance by not rejecting unilateral nuclear destruction, such as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Ri referred to a common report written by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work for "destruction of nuclear power on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has desired a formal end of the Korean war from 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted conversations to facilitate severe international penalties in North Korea.
‘United States insist on ‘reconstruction of nuclear power first’ and increase the pressure with penalties to achieve their purpose by force, and they were even opposed to ‘the declaration of ending peace’, Ri.
"True that penalties can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the penalties continue, our mistrust only grows.”
Don't mention anything about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. President highlighted in the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister weighed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months and added: "If the party in this call for the destruction of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the destruction on the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Still, the tone in Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the General Assembly in F.N. that it was not possible to stop North Korean missiles against the US continent, after the evil president Trump called Kim a missile on suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "total ruin" North Korea, Ausa praises Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that much work still needs to be done and that penalties must be kept in place to North Korea turns their nuclear weapons off.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frame for this, and said, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
But the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told F.N. the Security Council on Thursday: "The sanctions of the Security Council still need to be maintained strongly and without fail until we get the complete, final, verified settlement of the nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the penalties against North Korea since 2006 in order to strike funds for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidebar of the General Assembly in F.N. and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not work well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that it was made progress, but a few hours later he condemns North Korea for bringing "passes-like requirements."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to unmount a missile city and also an atomic complex if the United States did “such action”.
He said that Kim had told him that the "similar measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course in getting enough silence
This year, a new course at Harvard University has helped all students get more sleep, trying to fight against the growing macho culture that is studying in coffeinrus all night. It is that one uses caffeine to keep awake all night to study.
One academic found out that students at the high school often careless when it comes to the most basic thing -- how to take care of yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he thinks is the first of his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep lack on learning.
"At the end of it a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I told now, at the age of adults?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep -- something that surprises me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, roll out for the first time this year, the students explain what is important to how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improve their general welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of Psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and Director of Health Services at the University, said that the university decided to introduce the course after the students got seriously bader sleep during the week.
The hourly course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on caffeines, gardins, trainers and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep shortages, and how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep shortages can increase the risk of heart infarction, brain stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, invites participants to think about their daily routines.
"We know it won't change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know, the health effects by choosing to smoke cigarettes, Mr. Czeisler left.
The proud culture of the day still exists, he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep shortages are a growing problem.
To ensure that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapons against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even to avoid going up into weight, because sleep shortages see the brain in starvation mode and make them constantly swallow.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped professor Czeisler develop the course, after being a student at his previous year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eye and inspired him to press on to get a course for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study programme before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that the students consider to set a alarm for when to go to bed, and for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light coming from electronic monitors and LED lighting, which can turn the internal clock totally, resulting in problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menge-Measures give Gerrard's men a decline
Rangers went on a new defeat on the way away when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's outside to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking for taking his first sayer on the way off since 4-1 triumph on St Johnstone in February, but made to Gary Holt only causes Gerrard's second defeat on 18 struggles as leader, and gave eight points, one round under Ladbroke's leader of the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half-time, and a Ranger setup with lack of inspiration never seemed to compare.
While Rangers no falls down to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and is only behind the Hibernian on the destination.
And there may be additional problems in the stock of Rangers after the linerman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in his head, after an object seemed to have been thrown away from the way.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that celebrate Ayr into Betfred Cup semifinalane.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livy 11, who took a point with a drum shot last week, and he would have been excited about the way that Velrilla dress his clothes took the tightening of his opponents at every shift.
Rangers might have the ball most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scora after just two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle-way player failed in his giant assassin.
A long refrigerator park from Keaghan Jacobs found that captain Craig Halkett, but his defence party, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the resort.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morellos was determined to have punishment on the 20 meters mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Steven Thomson judges the wish to the Colombian.
Rangers only managed two shots on targets in the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was hardly worried by Lassana Coulibaly's heads and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the player's legs, no one can deny that they're only due to the "shot".
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep dead ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball of Scott Robinson, who held cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard made a break as if he switched Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange caused an immediate effect when the wings player made a luke for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly raided forward to blocking.
But Livingstone continues to override the guest team to play exactly what they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending forward long shots on long shots.
Holt's team could have increased the lease at the end, but McGregor is lucky to prevent Jacobs from it, until Lithgrow made a long post from the corner mark.
The reserve for Ranger, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim for punishment when he supported with Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE REKNAR ... the day when he who was to become the physician Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geier develops a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific beam all then, the Geiger teller also became a beam in popculture, like in the 1950 "Bells of Coronado", with the apparently unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in all the world is it?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you look at these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that come from the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, no blow it!"
“Hes” Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention that asks his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to ‘see’ red cells.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" red cells and kill them
vaccine teaches the immune defense to recognise red cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, and changing them in the laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common to many cancers, and then re-inject
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancer forms.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who learns the immune system to recognise red cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method means to extract immune cells from a patient, change them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘drive the growth of several types of cancer, including breast-, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells from patients and the “learning” of their targeting against cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Canye West starts with a Pro-Trump-diatribe, wearing a MAGA lue, after he visited the TV show Saturday Night Live. .
It didn't work so well.
Canye West was piped in the studio during Saturday night live after an amazing performance where he praised the United States' president, Donald Trump, and said he wanted to make elections in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he had a Make America Great Caps, he gave the Democrats a tirade and repeated support to Trump.
"So many times I speak to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a number with the comicist Matt Damon, where the Hollywood stars fooled Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate's judicial election on the debts of the sexual violation of Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it wasn't sent, the recording to West's tirade was uploaded to social media of comics Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to spot West with the post.
The West also complained to the audience that he had the difficult backstage because of his headslide.
"They mobbed me behind the scene.
They said, don't go out there with that hat.
They mugged me!
And then they say I'm in a falling place," he said, following Washington Examinos.
West continued: "Will you see the fallen place?" says that he would "take the superman caps, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Would you like the world to go forward?
Try love.’;»
His comments led to piping at least twice from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassingly affected, reported Variety, with a person who told the publication: "The whole studio was dead."
West was brought in as his replacement for the songer Ariana Grande, when her former boyfriend, the raper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confuses many with a presentation of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the Chief of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner as twitter: “To one of the most courageous spirits: TAK TO TAKE YOU OPP TO THE PÖBEL.”
But the talkshow-made Karen Hunter twitter that West was just as he is and it's quite amazing.
"But I didn't choose to pay anybody (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art") that I believe is embraced and spraying out ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are also” added it.
Before the show, the rapman advertised on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Medrappars, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and of course the last musical legend Prince, change the name of a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Stars Kit Harington goes out against toxic maskulinity
Kit Harington is familiar with the sword-winging role say as Jon Snow in HBO's elected medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the shot player, 31, has gone out against the stereo type of the macho hero, and says that such roles on the screen often lead to the feeling that young guys feel that they must be hard to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought something went wrong and asked how to deal with the toxic maskulinity problem in #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-oper Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows "very strong" to address the problem.
"I personally am convinced that something has gone wrong with the maskulinity." he said.
"What have we learned men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
My kit is that TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic maskulinity because of very male characters.
He continues: 'What's inborn and what's learning?
What is learned on TV and in the streets, what makes young guys feel that they must be this special aspect of being a man?
I really think it's one of the big questions of today -- how do we change that?
'Cause it's clear that something's gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones' procurement or orders when the series ends in summer, and he says he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepards True West, which is history of a film producer and his brother, who is a asshole.
The actress recently revealed that he looked at the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so it gave me the future family and my life on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the result of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-Price Rewarded imagination series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 % increase in new cases
China has advertised a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are the framework of the country, says health added.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter in 2018.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sex and marked a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a consequence of infected blood transfusions.
But many people who received HIV in this way were reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health staff at a conference in Yunnan Province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination by LGBT/HBTQ persons is claimed to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values in the country, studios have figured out that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses to add layer of information from the GOP-senator, it explodes in dangerous lies and conspiratory theories.
The United States Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had made personal information about three Republican American senators on the Wikipedia pages to the lawgivers.
Los Angeles Democracy claimed that the claims were pedalized by extreme-right-wing investigations and websites.
"Laughs, lies, and more contemptful lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information included information about home addresses and phone numbers of the American Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person at Capitol Hill under the Senate Panel's hearing about the debts of sexual violations against the High Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The play came once after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and published the information to a member of the Waters staff, reported Hill.
‘This reasonless claim is completely false and an absolute lie’ continues Waters.
"One of my additions - which has received its identity, personal information and security compromised as a consequence of these unreasonable and false claims - was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unreasonable claim is completely false and an absolute lie.’;»
The questions to Water were quickly criticised on the Internet, among others from former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial is angry’, wrote Fleischer.
"This indicates that it has no temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone gets blamed for something they didn't do, they don't have to be mad.
They must not be tough.
They must not ask questions about the motives of the shoulder.
They must be roles and peaceful.’
Fleischer proved to compare Waters' response to criticism of the Democrats of Judges Kavanaugh, who was owed by critics to be apparent for sinful during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is trying to overtake Water's place in the midway election, also expressed his tanks on Twitter.
‘Stor if it is true’, he twitter.
In the fraud, Waters said that her office had announced "the right powers and the legal enforcement units of these false claims.
‘We will ensure that the actors are revealed,’ she continues, ‘and they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for each and one of my employees.’
Johnny English again - spy dull of weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit remarks in all new films with a British angle, and it works current for this re-release of Johnny England's action-comedie spoof-franchise, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was re-released in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the self-ironic satire who deals with how openly we are become the new export power in the country?
At least, the big-worn, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber angel has been renewed his permission to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comics for cinema-witsers in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he is the foolish, secret agent who struck in his bizarres wants to spread a little glamour has got a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with a simple melody to the fire wagons, themes under the Olympic Opening Ceremony in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, which left chaos in the back.
There are one or two fine eye markers in this last JE excursion.
I love Johnny English who approaches a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armor theme while the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical komedie is on the screen, but the humor feels quite weak and strangely overflowy, especially since "serious" film marks such as 007 and Mission Impossible even no safely offer comedie as an ingredient.
The humor feels like he's directed to children instead of adults, and for me, Johnny England's noiseous accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replicate noise in the person of Bean.
The current permanent provision is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super secret web network of spys, which reveals the identity of all the agents of the United Kingdom in the area, to the horror of the agent at work - a unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last strike of a Prime Minister who is a pompous and war-hered figure, which already has a complete collapse of political opularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but it's not so much in the script to work with.
Her advisers inform her that when each active spy has been debted, she must pick up someone who is retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who is learning at an elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons about how to work undercover: a couple of fine witches here, since English offers a School of Rock type Academy for Spioning.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a necessity-briefing and reunited with its former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moves over to a submarine job, an enthusiastic role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little lost.
So Batman and Robin's ability to get things terrible crazy in Hennar Majesty's Secret Services is back too fully in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister fell dangerously under the charismatic technology of the billionaire, who claims that he can solve the UK's data problem: the horrible Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey of the farsi-like wild game: dressed as servants, set them guys on a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle on board Volta's yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy when he trys to use a Virtual Reality headset to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
Every stop is probably pulled out to the last sequence, but as lovable and outlined as it is, there's quite a lot of kid TV over all.
Very moderate things.
And like with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking, couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party refuses to prepare a plan for the English people to work for a four-day week but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party now considers a radical plan that will make the British work for a four-day week, but will be paid for five.
According to the report, business managers will forward savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees by giving them an additional Friday.
Then added could enjoy a three-day weekend -- but still get the same wage.
Sources said that the idea would "pass" with the party's economic agenda and plan to increase the benefits of employees.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by Trades Union Congress as a way for employees to benefit from the changed economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: A policy message is expected before the year's change.
'It doesn't happen during the night, but a four-day week of work is a desire that fits into the approach of the party to balance the economy for the worker, as well as superior to the party's industrial strategy.'
The Worker Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day week of work in his elections in 2017.
However, the ambition is not accepted by the Labour Party.
A speaker from the Labour Party said, "A four-day working week is not a party policy and it is not assessed by the party."
John McDonnell's Shadow Canal used last week's work conference to strengthen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "sightless directors" and "profits" in rich enterprises.
The plans of the shade-cancer also mean that current actor shareholders cannot recover their entire efforts as a labour government could ‘retract’ because of perceived misbehavior.
He has also confirmed plans to place employees in company managers and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) to provide 10 percent of the equity in private sector management, which would receive annual dividends of up to SEK 500, about SEK 5000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the '60 Minutes' TV programme whether the FBI could make them change their tanks
The FBI investigation of complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the High Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of the extent to which the Agency found to influence some Republican senators to draw their support.
In a Sunday interview, correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal something that would make them re-determine.
Kennedy works more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I am, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said on the way into the hearing, I said, I've spoken to the judges of Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was intended, firmly intended, clarified.’;
Graham's voice seemed still to be seen in stone.
"I have made my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite accusation to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Fold deny it strongly, "laught Graham, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all of its names could not verify it.
It's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is New York host for the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music arrangement that has an enormous impressive appearance of stars that act and a similarly impressive mission; end poverty in the world.
Now in his seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people grouped into the Central Park's great plenary, not only to enjoy seeing Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes acting, but also to increase consciousness for the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert wizards had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary work; send e-mail to a world manager, call a phone call or other meaningful ways to contribute to increasing consciousness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how much success has Global Citizen been with 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of paying people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feel that they make a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a twot?
Since 2011, Global Citizen said it has recorded more than 19 million ‘actions’ from its support players and participated and pressed on a number of different goals.
It is said that these actions have helped world leaders to publish commitments and policies corresponding to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and publications as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the resources to date have been directly affected by almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important obligations are The Power of Nutrition, a British-based partnership of investors and actors who are obliged to “help children to achieve their full potential”; promises to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help end sub-nutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 twots from global citizens.
“With support from the British Government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just as you, we can make the social injustice of undernutration a footnote in history” - spoken ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, audience under a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after they had taken more than 5000 actions to demand that the United Kingdom be better in nutrition for mothers and children, the British Government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the website, they say, "Who makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizens replied: "There will be a long and difficult road -- sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great citizens' rights and the anti-apartness movements lead us, we'll be lucky because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the players who act on the year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Fleet as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy sports - Secretary of the Kingdom
Washington may ‘if necessary’ to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed international secretary Ryan Zinke, as quoted by Washington Examines.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate on the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to communicate energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he must have said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to accept it.
"United States have this evna, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that their energy does not go on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a ideal group presenting themselves as the ‘voting to the energy consumer’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, and he noted that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution in Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels," he said, while pointing to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with a economy depending on fossil fuels.
The Declarations come as the Trump Administration has been on the mission to increase the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, and replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this connection, the Trump administration service officers, including the US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipe project, which subsequently made Berlin the "catcher" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
Kreml claims that Washington's enthusiastic resistance to the project is only driven for economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the position that energy cannot be a tool for exercising pressure and for consumers to choose the suppliers," said the Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American attitude has withdrawn from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's Leading Organisation for Industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has invited the United States to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country disturbs our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German mayor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to "run hard" to be a president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would take a "thorough look" on silent as president candidate after midway elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider to be a candidate.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and it includes a woman at the top," she said following The Hill.
‘After 6 November, I will consider carefully to be a president.’
Warren took up President Donald Trump at the Council meeting and said that he was "incorrectly conducting this country."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy," said she.
Warren has been crushed in his criticism by Trump and his High Court Valdent Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a measurement of meaning that was published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own choosers do not think it should still be a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of the "probable" Massachusetts choosers said that the senator should not be a candidate, following Suffolk University Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe survey.
Thirty percent supported such a candidate.
The study showed more support for a round of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The prayer said he wanted to decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being arrived in September.
He was arrested and accused of a police event in the home on Monday evening
"What my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, allow me to relate to other families that are characterized by PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," she said to the audience at a collection of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little change, they come back the Herde, they come back and wonder if the respect for what they and co-pilots and pilots and all other soldiers have done for the country, are there."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was owed for physical authority in the home against a woman, to have disrupted a report on the government of the home and the storage of a weapon while he was rushed, following Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policies
18 states and districts in Columbia support a legal challenge to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who refuge from refugee or elected in the home.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-law short Friday in Washington to support a asylum seeker who challenges policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace v. Sessions is suitable for the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Freedom Union) archived in August against federal policy.
She said that her party “and the elected gentlemen’s sons” abused her, but American officials refused her application for asylum 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States who support Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large amount of applicants for American asylum, which nations face a major problem with throats and armed in the world.
The new American asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from the immigration law, which allowed illegal immigrants who refuge from the host of the world to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a report on Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law."
‘Fødational law requires all asylum matters to be judged for the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement and such an obstacle to this principle’, said the court's friend briefly.
Advocates further claimed that the policy that refuses access to immigrants harms the US economy, and says it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and ‘advocate necessary work’.
General Advocate Jeff Sessions orders immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims who escaped abuse and reimbursed in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who left their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political meaning’, said Sessions in its publication of policy in 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to ease all the problems - even all serious problems - people face every day across the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu while deadly double in the race to find surviving
For surviving, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It seems very excited," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who threw the fever-sick baby son at a evacuation center in the devastated city, Palu.
‘Every minute comes with body ambulances.
Clean water is difficult to find.»
Inhabitants are observed on their way back to their destroyed homes, where they are searching for washed property and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were damaged, and the hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a strength of 7.5, were overfilled.
Some of them damaged, including Dwi Haris, who had breached back and shoulder, causing outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because of still strong afterscribing.
Tears filled his eye while he told him that he knew the powerful earthquake shake the hotel room he shared with his wife and his daughter in the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I believe, "said Haris to the Associated Press, and added that his family was in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador owes China for “mubbing” with “propaganda advertisers”
One week after an official Chinese newspaper carried out a 4-page advertising in an American newspaper and highlighted the mutual advantages of trade with the United States and China, the US Ambassador against China Peking to use the US press to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid funds in the Des Moines register - the state of Iowas's largest salsavis - after owing China to try to join the US Congress elections on 6 November, a debt China denies.
Trump's debt that Beijing was trying to interfere with American elections, noticed what U.S. servicemen spoke to Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign of Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Peking and Washington are currently locked into an increasing trade war that has seen them in turn increase taxes on each other’s imports.
China’s repayment tariff father was designed early in the trade war to hit exporters in states like Iowa, who supported the Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural product to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
‘China’, Branstad wrote in a sense in the Sunday Des Moines register, ‘dobbles no mobbing by running propaganda ads in our own free press.’
"In its propaganda dissemination, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's dear tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by entering a paid advertisement into the Des Moines register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, at the aviskism down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited abnormal voices and will not see any true mirror of the different meanings that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic path, given that the media are under the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party "written he.
He suggested that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article," even though he didn't say what a newspaper.
Republicanars abmand female electors lead the mid-term with Kavanaugh Debacle, warning Analytics.
Since many top Republicans are stand-by and defenders the High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in meeting with several debts on sexual abuse, the analyst has warned that they will probably see a relapse, especially from women, in the coming midway elections.
Feelings around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have recorded that they already wanted to proceed with one voice.
These things cannot undo, says Grant Reeher, professor of State Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last eyeblinks would be enough for an FBI investigation to relax sinful choosers.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday. Washington, DC presentation.
On Friday morning, Protestants “November comes!” as they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate when the Republicanars, governing the Court Committee, chose to go on with Kavanaugh’s nomination in the burden of witness by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be outside the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partic political analyst, to the news page.
"The people say it's already been high, it's true.
But there may be higher, especially among women's electors in the presidencies and younger electors, 18 to 29 years old, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public witnessing, as detailedly indicated the claims of sexual violation directed against the nominated Supreme Court, analytics suggested that a return could follow if the Republicans pressed forward with the confirmation.
“This has been a confused root of the GOP”, said Michael Steele, former leader of the Republican National Committee, early in the previous week, following NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the Committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is seen on the bench, it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have handled it," Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities United States, a group involved in choosing democrats, pointing to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who they're going to believe in in the cooling water of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more side tracks with the latter.
A new sense measurement from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably thought of Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they were definitely or probably threatening Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying under their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the press from Flake, the FBI is exploring the claims made by Ford, and at least another complaint, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed to the jurisdiction committee of the Senate during the previous week that Kavanaugh completely violated her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the High Court nominated showed her the gender bodies while they attended a party during the time they studied at Yale University in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Plan Inventor to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a start that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project for the technology legend, Inrup, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where the data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee spooked that the meaning of Inruption is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
‘It's a historical eyelink.’
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "Personal Online Data Storage" or an POD.
It may contain contact lists, memories, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it ‘personal formation through data’.
The idea of Inruption, following the management director of the company John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company consists for the eyelash of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some contracted developers to work with the project, as well as a community of voluntary encoders.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inruption website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about not implementing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on the head overnight.
"We don't request their permissions."
In a post on media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruption's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network collection built on Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice with a great influence in the debate on network neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inruption, Berners-Lee will become the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.

Bernard Water: WW1 Victoria Cross Divine celebration
The goddess of the only English church who won a Victoria cross during the first world war that a fighter has been celebrated in the home town of 100 years afterwards.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Water won the price on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Yet, he was killed by a shield fire days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was disposed of his two grandchildren on a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vand, said that it was "brillant symbol" that the stone would be disappeared just 100 years after his grandfather's price-winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Water's battalion led over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very thick shot and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
Later he ran up to the front line, and with the "largest galantery" the line led forward before he ran up with a field rifle and struck out three of the group.
Lt Col Watn was killed by a German sniff shooter on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vand, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am audience for."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also made a crane after the parade, which was led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vand said that he knew very arrogant about playing a role in the parade, and added that "the value of a real is completely displayed by the support given by many people."
The MMA fan was up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a Bellator 206 package and you will not be able to see the main event.
The account from San Jose contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the United Kingdom on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just in what Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepare to meet each other, watchers in the United Kingdom were again stumbled when the covers changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were a little impressed after they had kept awake to the early timans especially for the battle.
A fan on Twitter described bytes to the comic series of children as "a kind of sick joke."
"It is public regulation that 6 o'clock if the inlet was not owned, they had to switch to the program for children," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice-president for marketing and communication, when he was asked for the transfer.
‘The Peppa pig, ‘yes’
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they're going to work with planning to include British watchers in the future.
"I believe that when I think of replay, I think we can probably find out," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we can't find out this until Sunday of our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when it went over, there were many texts that went forward and back, and everyone was not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, the next time it won't happen.
We held it to five matches instead of six -- as we usually do -- and we tried to surrender to the fan, and we just went over.
It is an accidental situation.’
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was familiar with ‘underlying’ due to sexuality
The Olympic stuper Tom Daley says that in his growth he felt bader than everyone because of his sexuality -- but that he gave the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went on a further school that "not all are like me."
When he talked on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he talked out about his homosexual rights to give others "hope".
He also said to be a parent made him less care about winning the OL.
The firm reporter in the long-run show, Kirsty Young, has taken free several months because of disease.
What could look like a disappeared in the Lavas first program, Daly said he knew "less than" all the others who grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to like goods and girls."
He said, "From today, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different, the real things that have given me power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-way bronze Olympic Medal has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance on the Commonwealth Games of the year in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky who could live open without discretion and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said it was to be in love with a man - the American film creator Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - " surprise me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he, last year, but he said that the age difference would never have been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" -- he went to the first OL's 14-year-old and his father died by cancer three years later -- he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and downturns.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that the whole "his" perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, do everything if I have to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie.»
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked for was if they had tickets to London 2012-- when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be in the front row," he said.
"I was able to take care of when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he was not inevitable," he said.
The following year Daley competed at OL in 2012 and water bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed about my whole life -- to pop in front of a home public on an Olympic game, where there is no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - stolen by Heather Small - who had vibrated with him in the construction of the OL and gave him still goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape his Mickelson on the bench of Ryder Cup Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Clears Cup battle, but he has to turn forma say to avoid that it is an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record twelve time, was seen on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in front of the Saturday golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, which he has often been for the United States, split the five-fold winner's day between being a cheerleader and working with his game before the range of time for the hope of correcting what he is plaguing.
Never the most competent long-shots. Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is best to hit the long-shot on the trone, French main course, where balls hit outside if the golf player is not exactly with the hits.
And if the course itself is not frightening enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth battle Sunday, the exact British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined with the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all the four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single matches, get to a hot start, Mickelson's struggle may be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say much else.
"He completely understood the role he had today, gave me a klapp on his back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two fights.
I saw more, but that's how it was, and that's what we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will hit Nick Faldo's record in most Cleaner Cup games that will be played on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Cleaner Cup career that has never completely matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 losses and seven halfs, even though Furyk said that his closeness added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the layer room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun that got a deal with him, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just playing.»
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great loan can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows of experience that a significant lease on the road into the last days' singles of Ryder Cup can easily be transformed into an uncomfortable trip.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where a captain of the Seven Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came over the target line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continued to remind you that we had a great rental at Valderrama; we had a great rental at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far," said Bjørn, after he had seen the class 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in that team that this is not over.
You go to full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have the scores on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus will stay.
I've said all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're so well aware of what's over on the other side -- the largest players in the world."
Happy about how his players acted on a tough golf course, Bjørn added: "I would never take the speaker in advance.
Tomorrow's another day.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performance that comes out, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you're being tested full of your capacity as a golf player.
This is the message you need to communicate to players; get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your party, and he must go and get the best out of himself too."
In contrast to Bjørn, the number of Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as participants, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of turning operations in the big last days, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before he ends who loses when Europe pulled out of 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I think every fucking word of it," he said in his answer to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had gathered his players in the last day.
“We have 12 important fights tomorrow, but you want to start the quick start you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When that moment gets a way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the matches.
We set up our line-up corresponding and set the goods in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magic tomorrow' .
Thomas has been assigned to try to lease the battle and meet Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the arrangement.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I believe it covers the whole road," said Bjorn about their whales of singles.
Germany's new warships exposed yet once
The latest fregate to the German Marine should have been ordered in 2014 to replace ageing warships from the cold war period, but it will not be there until at least next year due to the wrong system and significant costs, reported local media.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leadership of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregats, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, following Die Zeit-avisa, quoting a military speaker.
The ship should have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships The Sea Defence ordered back in 2007, comes as a replacement for the ageing Bremen class fregates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful canon, a variety of anti-fly and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to place the latest fregates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the path-breaking warships, which certainly allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be deprecated when they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The accidental F125 fregate made headings last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
It was little known about the reasons for returning, but German media quoted a number of important 'software and hardware errors' that made the warship unusable if they were placed on a battle task.
Software errors were particularly important when the ships in Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the workforce of older Bremen fregates.
It also showed that the ship is dramatic overweight, which reduces performance and limits the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7000 tonnes ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ are assumed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from incorrect hardware, the price of the entire project - including training of the crew - is also a problem.
It is said to have reached diminishing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from introductory €2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems related to the most recent fregates are particularly important in the light of the last warnings that Germany’s fleet force decreases.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, recognized that the fleet in fact “has almost ended on distribution competent ships”.
The officer said that the problem was built over time, because old ships were dismantled, but no replacement ship was delivered.
He complains that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregats were able to join the fleet.
National Trust Hears of Secret Life for Flag Mice
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish highland aims to reveal how flager mice use the landscape in the hunting of food.
It is hoped that findings will throw new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to guide future preservation activities.
The study of researchers at National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles and further brown long ear and Daubenton flagermus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track flager mouse activities throughout the entire season.
NHS adders and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flager mice calls and the species that do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS scientific consultant, hopes that the results will reveal the areas of habitats, natural homes, which are most important for the flager museums and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the purchasing of eng and how it is best to maintain in the same forest area for flager mice and other related species.
Flagsmus populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects vulnerabilities and the loss of habitats/building areas.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatments of construction materials, and also attacks of pet cats.
Flag mouse is not actually blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eye when it comes to catching prey animals.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to find faults and obstacles in their aerodrome.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the flager museums very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, vacuum inspections and a few times save lives.
The organisation has even created Scotland’s first and only dedicated flager mice reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfreees and Galloway, which is the home of eight of Scotland’s ten flager mice species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threave we have a great area for flager mice," he said.
"We have old buildings, many wheat trees and all the good habitats.
But there is a lot about flager mice that is still unknown, so that the work we do here and on other ownership judgments will help us to understand more about what they need to enjoy.”
He underlines the importance of checking for flager mice before carrying out maintenance within ownership judgments, as it is possible that infinite destruction of a single array can kill up to 400 female flags mice and young people, and perhaps eradicate a whole local population.
Flagms are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, plague, disturb or destroy their silences.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to come in and help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our flager mice and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are in danger."
Ronaldo rejects warrant debts in the case of lawyers accusing German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has marked the guilt guilt against himself as "false news" and says that people "will highlight themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers were put to prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus forwarden have been owed to elect an American woman called Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million followers only hours after the debts, that the debts are "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, says five times the Goldball winner into the camera.
'They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They will be familiar with my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything good, "Look the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel of the claims, which they have called "a inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy", following Reuters
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would search for replacement for " moral damage in a amount that is at the seriousness of the breach of rules, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality in the past few years".
The claimed event is said to have been held in June 2009 on a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where one claims that he should have chosen her anally, following documents submitted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on the knee after the assumed event and declared that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed with "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken photography of her injuries at a hospital, but was later agreed on an explanation because she felt “screamed by recompensation” and was concerned about“becoming publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to change the building where she continues to be traumatized by the claimed event.
Ronaldo was on the edge to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a $100 million agreement.
Brexit: UK would 'forever undo' to lose car manufacturers
United Kingdom “will undo it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader before car production after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark has said.
He suggested that it was “om” that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an appointment," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in case a non-contracted Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston installation - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, where 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, we see the production stop at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Executive Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fear of leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns deal with what car manufacturers say are the risk of supply chain in case of a non-contracted Brexit.
Toyota's production line is driven on a ‘just-in-time’ basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from both the United Kingdom and the EU suppliers for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement on 29 March, disturbances may occur at the border that the industry is able to lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's inventories at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is ‘net calibrated to avoid border controls’.
"We need an appointment. We want to have the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to arrest this possibility," he said BBC Radio 4's day program.
“Proof not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are that we must certainly be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the installation and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union Association at the plant, said that his members are more concerned with: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they never come back.
A speaker to the government said, "We have presented a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's Supreme Meeting with Conseil Advocate Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the fight against the High Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special council Robert Mueller, investigating the Russian-selected mix, interconnections between Trump assistants and Russia and potential obstacles to the law of the President.
Corvidt Trump will dismiss the general of the prosecutors or not, and thus put Mueller's self-property in danger, has given food to Washington cheating for several months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a rental to register conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th change.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the white house, and it was reported that he was about to quit.
In the city, a meeting with Trump, which was then with the United Nations in New York, was advertised for Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to "preferred" not to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senat Commission's hearing of both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed the full vote from the Senate.
Trump his press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "There has been no date. It may be this week, but I can and see that it will be delayed another week because of everything else happens in the High Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some reporters may disagree: Sanders has not held a press orientation for the White House since 10 September.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientation was not due to a dissatisfaction with the TV reporters' game for the gallery, even though she said, "I don't agree that they do it."
She mentioned that direct contact between Trump and press will increase.
"The President holds more press conferences than any President has done before," he said - right enough without giving evidence of the claim. "We have looked at speech."
Sanders says that updates are still going to happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it like that, and you've seen us do it often in the past few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump accepts regularly questions when he travels from the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It's unusual that the President is holding press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, where he appeared to lead the reporters without shame, and almost bizarre.
Hospital secretary writes about Brexit fear to EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU workers working at NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a wish to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, who is a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter, even though it is less than six months again before the United Kingdom departs from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to accept the costs of applications that have the status of EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations have continued ongoing withdrawal between the United Kingdom and the EU, and it is closer to the expected conclusion of the harvest.
Nevertheless, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I realize this must be a difficult time for you all.
That's why I'm going to repeat the price I looked at the contributions to everyone, regardless of what nationality they have.
EU colleagues, and outside, have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and address the work in the health sector and benefit patients and societies.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we would like you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute operation after head damage
The linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an acute surgery after dragging on a head damage when the team lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports the newspaper The Tennessean.
The main trainer of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told the reporter that the damage happened just before break.
"He came to the sidebar and collapsed in some way," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidebar before they put him on a bar and took him back for further evaluation.
A official spokesman from Tennessee State, WSMV told us that Abercrombie had finished surgery at Vanderbilt medical centers.
There is no detail about the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and suggested that Tennessee State still is trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes the second year at the university, and is in its first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five cabs before he was injured in Saturday's battle, and he's now up in 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign purchasers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom. The additional income will be used to help the homeless, following the new plans of the conservatives.
Decide will neutralise Corbyn's success in attracting young choosers
The increase in the document fee will be added for those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The State Bank expects an increase of up to 120 million pounds per year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will advertise today that foreign buyers have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom. The additional income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be considered as an attempt to neutralise the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young choosers who tend a lot, with the promise of offering reliable buildings.
The increase in the document fee will be added for individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds shall strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of circulars.
The fee, which comes in addition to the current document fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on hire number two and hire places, may be as much as three percent.
The State Bank expects decisions to get up to 120 million pounds per year.
Approximately 13 percent of the new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside the United Kingdom, making prices higher, and it becomes more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the residential market.
Many prosperous areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers most of the time in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused the large design company to keep the prices up by obtaining property, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the allowances of rheumatile buildings to fix the UK 'bustadsskam'.
Corbyn has announced a series of obvious proposals for building reforms, including controlled rentals and the termination of exhibitions without reason.
He wants to give more power to build new buildings.
May said, " Last night I said that I would dedicate my position to bring back the British dream -- that life should be better for each new generation.
That means fixing the corrupted busted market.
United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be right that it should be equally simple for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, or foreign company, to buy homes as it is too hardworking, British inhabitants.
Too many people have the dream of their own building ports too far away, and the audience by being strokes is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
The Chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "final ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at one time.
The shot (42) faces the challenge of reliving the club from north-east. At the moment they are in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light last summer, after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series last season.
"I wanted to play for my country playing.
I got a B-land struggle, and that was it," said Ross to Scotland BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up to see Scotland on Hamden together with my father, and there's always been something that's pulled me back.
This option can only come if I have been successful as a club manager.»
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland Manager include Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Chief of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come after so many established names in such a big club, since he has previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I can get this club back in the Premier League."
In the light of the structures and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they hear homes in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I probably can only view myself as successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in the career as manager, after a period as assisting boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts trainer.
He then helped Alloa to come from decree to third level, and transformed St Mirren, who was on the way to move down, to title-wines in the mastership series the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a road-separator," he says about leading Alloa.
"I really thought that being the manager fits me much better than being a player.
It's most bizarre out, because I did it well, tend well and like it relatively good.
But playing can be hard.
There's a lot of things you're tired of getting through every week.
I still notice it when it comes to stress and pressure with the job, but it seems to be right to be manager.
I always wish to be manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable thing I've felt in my own body throughout my grown life."

Study shows that the perfect time for a half-litre is 17.30 on a Saturday
The summer's hot wave has led to an increase in the incineration of Stressful Pubars in the United Kingdom, but increasing the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, the sale increased by 2.7 per cent in childcare - but for the restaurant industry it went down by 4.8 per cent, the statistics show.
Corporate adviser Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "The present sun, and the fact that England was part of the VM longer than planned means that July followed the pattern for June where puba, 2.8 per cent, just that restaurants were even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry was only worse in July.
Pubars and bares as selling drinks, made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubars like sell food, got and notice the decline in the sun, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It might seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bares, the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had fallen three percent.
Paul Newman, analyzer of travel and leisure at RSM, said: "These results are the continued trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to the nightlife industry.
It is not surprising that the restaurant industry will still be wearing. A reduction in the sale of 4.8 percent per year will be hurt to get on the top of a running cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for operators driven with food. The time will indicate whether the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can give an extended breathing room.»
The total salesauking across pubars and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, which reflects the decline in the release of brands.

One of five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - has secret profiles on social media that they hide from parents and teachers, shows an investigation
Exploration of 20 000 further students reveals an increase in false Insta profiles
This news has increased fear of sexual content being posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a "head" profile they show parents
One of five children - some as young as 11 - creates profiles on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A 20 000 student study on further school revealed a significant increase in false Insta profiles – a reference to the Instagram image sharing platform.
News has increased the fear that sexual content should be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile head profile they refer to parents, while having private profiles.
A mother who snatched over the secret side to her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who invited others to "select me".
Research, made by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) on different schools, found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of these admitted to private users.
The manager of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It is unrecognitive that so many teenagers are tempted to create sites on the web where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes ‘the voice of the athletes’ in the Scottish Freedom Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Freedom as the non-administrative Director of the Board's Annual General Assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated lawyer in Scotland, and director Ian Beattie describes the event as a great possibility for those who lead sports to benefit from her extensive experience at international level during the last decade.
"Eilidh has a great deal of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world's free sports community, and we are sure that the law of free sport in Scotland can benefit from getting it into the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for practitioners, and I hope I can help and help the sports in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among its total four OL gold and is now a regular guest at BBC, was not able to go after a drop.
On Twitter he wrote: "Today it's a month ago I got a hit.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said it was just the time that could tell me if I'm going to be good again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've been very good again, I've learned to go again, and today I'm doing flexibility beasts!

Divided internet meanings of breast pumping clamps comparing mothers with milk cows
A breast pump company has split the opinion on the Internet with an advertising that compares breast-feeding mothers with milk cows.
To mark what is described as “verything silent, seated breast pump” the Elvie technology company dropped a small frequent advertising inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom of the new pump giving mothers that extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled cave with cows, to a song that includes text like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you don't notice it, this is not spenns, it's my pops."
The refractory continues: "Damp it out, pump it out, I feed these children, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
On the other hand, the advertising, published on the company's Facebook page, has created controversies on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many say it lights "screaming" in the meiery industry.
‘Very bad determination to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and feed to produce milk, just that the calves are trusted from them only days after birth," says one.
Elvie breast pump sits discrete in a ammonia BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Reasonably traumatic enough for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their kids?»
Another added: "For a reconciliation removal of advertising."
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she seems to be “fast”.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I still grandmother.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This advertising is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertising directed to mothers like pumps (often at work or at the toilet) and feels like cows.
This is not a advertising that shouts or judges the meieri industry.»
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they all dance with the discreet pump packed into their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women pumping, say they feel like cows.
On the other hand, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no leases or pipes, and its discrete inside a breast-BH, which gives women freedom to move, keep their kids, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it evolves a wave and provocative launch.
By pulling a parallel between mothers who extract milk and milk cattle, we wish to put a search light on breast pumping and challenges associated with this, and simultaneously demonstrate the immense freedom of the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognisable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the moteuka in London, a mother to two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved in silence to tent camp on the border of Texas
The number of immigrant children has risen, even if monthly border transitions have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the strict policy of the Trump administration has made it more difficult to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that it can threaten their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk of the increase in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members are required to submit fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence witnessed the immigration and customs enforcement of the Congress and said that the Agency has arrested dozens of people who have sought to be sponsor for single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had nothing on their scrollsheet before.
'Narrow 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to continue persecuting these people," said Albence.
Following the additions in the camp, new rules have now been introduced to handle the children. The rules require that some of them must now be in court before one month has gone, against earlier 60 days.
Many want to participate via video calls and not at personal meetings, in order to have their case tried to lead an immigration judgment.
Those who are not qualified for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer children are in possession, the more likely it is that they develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to elusive outbreaks or escapes, they say added to the camp. Reports that have appeared in the last months say the same.
Talkers say that these concerns are greater in large installations such as Tornillo, and because of the size of the plant, it is more likely that there are signs that children are wearing.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or saying hatred to veins, can strengthen traumas that many have already had.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish occupational forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked that Syrian refugees come home, even though the country is now in war on the eighth year.
Moualem, who is and acts as Minister of State, said that prominent forces remain illegal on Syrian soil under the impression of fighting terrorism, and "will be treated out of it".
‘They must withdraw immediately and without preliminary intentions’, he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that ‘the war against terror is almost over’ in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost life since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said that Damaskus will continue to “fight a sacred battle until all Syrian territory has been cleaned” for both terrorist groups and“Unlawful presence of ahead.”
The United States has about 2,000 drops in Syria, mainly for training and consulting both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 drops on the ground in the wary country.
When it was about the refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he was owing to "some western countries" to have "spread irrational fear" about the surroundings that caused the refugees to stay away.
"I have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return," he said.
'They make policies of something that would be a pure humanitarian problem.'
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to reconstruction in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last large rebellion party, has created a possibility to continue pressing forward with political conversations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejects a major attack from Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will be directed against jihadistars, including warriors from the nusrafront, which are linked to Al-Qaeda, which will be "extinct."
The United Nations embassy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition member to draw up a postwar law for Syria, and path to the election.
Moualem lays down the conditions for the Syrian Government's participation in the Committee and says that the panel's work should be restricted "to review the articles of the present Constitution" and warned against disturbances.
Why Trump will win another term
With that logic, Trump will win the reselection in 2020 if, as many liberal observers probably hope, the presidentship gets an early end because of scandals and ranks.
It would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic end of a presidentship ever!'
At the moment of writing, there is no sign that the viewers have suffered.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in the best shipping time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has almost threefold to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best shipping time, from 1.7 million years ago, following Nielsen. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has a doctor at the top of the cable rating with as much as 3.5 million viewers at evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are locked off, because there's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designed Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the congress building.
Nell Scovell, old comedie author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She's thinking a trip in a cab in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver said he came to vote on Trump.
Why did she ask?
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied after Scovell.
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, in contrast to everything else on TV, history coming from Washington can decide the future to Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families get together again and well to the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond it to be an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bombing jacket of strutseler to $15,000 ("eit plagg thick of arrogance," said Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's horrible description of Trump's, uh, anatomi.
Personally, I will never look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"Share of what he does that makes it known as a reality program is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creates by "Pawn Stars", about the show that goes with Trump's employees and daily disputes (come into a fight with NFL, rose Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you can't hang with anymore.
When I hit Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Commission and the future of the High Court was hanging in a thin thread.
"I think then we made all these crazy shows before and people said "This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money flows into the nearest intermediate game
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees a lot of money, thanks to the conversion of the districts of the Congress that led to two sitting members fighting the same seat.
It recently transformed the suburban district of Pittsburg proclaims Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in spring last year.
Lamb fights against another sitting member, the Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative of the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th district.
Maps were redesigned after the High Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
Competition on the 17th district has launched a weapons drag on the financing of the campaigns, between the large parties' money arsenal, the Democratic Congress Committee and the Republican Congress Committee.
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congress District.
The seat had listened to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with more than 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little advantage.
The United States considered to punish El Salvador because of support to China, but pulled away
Diplomatics note that the Dominic Republic and Panama have already recognized Peking without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama for parties to throw out the Trump organisation's leadership group.
State Secretarys decided to bring back the U.S. Heads of Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominic Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the minister's spokesman, in a statement early this month.
But punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, which received estimated $ 140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which contained cutting into economic support and targeted restrictions in view of visa, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
Since the internal meeting developed, North American and Central American officials exposed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year that was considered a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the US.
But in the middle of September, the top administrators informed that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore stopped the assessment of the penalty for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice-President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been planned in the middle of October, as a signal on the relevance of the administration on the assembly, said the diplomats.
And the three American transmitters returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominic Republic without new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomates, who were some about discussing the internal considerations on the provision of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outstanding analyst who is working closely with the administration and disproportionately speaking under the condition of anonymity.
Student History
One is waiting for special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
Following the reports, Mueller must have focused on the research to whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia's idea of attacks on our choice.
If the Congress was to exchange the governors, Trump would have to be in charge of this body, in preparing to convince the electors and possibly a jury of his equals.
There is a lot of "what about" and I do not mean that Trump's case is inevitable – rather for his counterpart in Europe.
There are choices to take for us all on both sides of the pond, which will affect how prolonged the battle can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a state coupon against Hitler, only the West had been opposed to him and helped the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed a possibility to avoid the years of blood bathing resulted in this.
The course of history is about such turning points, and democracy is accelerated or exposed to its unhealthy march.
The Americans are faced with several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Vice-President Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water since this newspaper revealed that last year he proposed to listen to the President in hide, and wondered if he is inappropriate for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or is he accepted by the High Court despite trustworthy debts of sexual violation, and unearly testimony?
And above all, will we in the middle-walk vote for a Congress who held Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong, because of what I learned in Praha.
My mother was a Czechoslovakia Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime as once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me out of the garden to light the Sabbath light on the table that asks the swastika.
When this is my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic in view of the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers accept Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the Austrians, after an impressive disagreement in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify themselves from Group G of the European League.
A knee damage prevents Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2-2 result against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a jumping board for bigger things.
"There was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good layer," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the struggle with the threat that we could get something, and came out with one point.
Maybe we could take it at the end, but everything at all is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and was better made.
On Thursday, there will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough fight, they've got a good result in their previous match, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been hard, with everything that has happened to my injury and changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the wells are thriving; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run now, put the previous season behind us and be successful.”
Women lose sleep over this fear of pension saving
Despite the fact that participants in an investigation had clear thoughts about how they would be taken care of, there were few people talking to family members about it.
Approximately half of those who participated in an investigation by the National Insurance Society, they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about that.
"People want a family member to take care of, but they do not take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says the Vice-President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and kids: You can't prepare your family to care for you unless you do your wish for good time in the front.
Cooperation with a consultant and your family to discuss how to get care, since these choices may be a major part of the cost fixing.
Fetch a financial adviser: Your advisor can help you find out how to pay for these expenses.
Financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance for care, a life insurance with cash value to help pay the costs, or that you insurance yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Create legal documents: Reject legal matches before they start.
Put in place a health authority so that you designate a person you trust to supervise your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also assess a power for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make economic decisions and make sure that your accounts are paid if you do not have a possibility yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Make sure your old parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Print all of these details in a written schedule, so you are ready.
"It's not just the finances it's about, but who's the legs?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medicine is that?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?

Federal actors will rarely have death penalty for suspicious in New York Terror
Federal actors in New York will have a death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare penalty that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) shall have used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway at the bottom of Manhattan in October, where he run down footwears and hospital lists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, the actors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" caused the serious physical damage, following a note archived in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these events may be the basis for a possible death penalty, says the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury survived a list of 22 appeal points, including eight sentences for murders targeting money-pressure, usually used by federal actors in connection with organised crime, and a target for the power and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack claimed "decisive planning and overlay", said the actors and descriptively the way Saipov carried out the attack as "abhorious, cruel and deceitful".
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov causes damage and loss for families and venes of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’ is noted.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York sentenced death penalty in one case.
The target, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to have killed two baptism suppliers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced for conspiracy to commit spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
On June 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of indications in the days and months followed, following legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done most well, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on the phone, it is stated in the claim.
He also asked for the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He hasn't declared guilty at all points of appeal.
David Patton, one of the federal public defences representing Saipov, says that they are “precisely disappointed” with decided to the prosecution authority.
"We believe that deciding to go after death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of debt for lifetime in prison without the possibility of release, only will extend dreams from the event for all involved," said Patton.
The defenders of Saipov had previously asked the actors not to go after death penalty.
Member of the House in Tory of my Nigel Farage should lease Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘mobilise the army’ today, during a protest at the Tory Country Meeting.
The former leader of the British Independent Party said that the politicians had to “peak the pressure” of the Euroskeptics – one of Theresa May's Members suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Conservative Member of Parliament Peter Bone told the demonstrants in Birmingham that the United Kingdom had "out" no, if Farage was Minister of Brexit.
With May's challenge to slow down its deeply divided ranks, a separate protest in the city has been underlined, held by Tories who wants to be in the EU.
The Minister of State struggled to keep the plane with the Chequers compromise on the right track after attack from Brexites, Remains and the EU.
Allies insist that they will press to make an agreement with Brussels, despite the backtrack – and force the Euroskeptics and the Worker Party to choose between her package and ‘caos’.
Bone told the Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihol that he wanted to "Discard Chequers"

We will make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejects the claim that the meaning of the people has changed since the election in 2016: "The idea that the British people have changed meaning and wish to be is completely false."
Brexit fighters from Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in March. Ho told the reporters: "I'm just saying, Minister, listen to the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it; it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequently wait the streets and get us chosen at the beginning.
Please, drop Chequers and listen to it»
In a message directed against May, she adds: "State ministers keep their jobs when they keep what they promise."
Farage said that politicians must ‘recognize the heat’ if they are to betray the decisions made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that "we won't let them get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to get the political class, which is on the tip to betray Brexit, to know the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us to say in Brexit and will not be silent until we have become an independent, self-dependent, proud United Kingdom.

There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.

It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump deceived Senator Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday election meeting because of her insistence that she did not paint the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she appeals to the High Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual violations.
During a speech at a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention the Ford certificate directly to the Senate Commission, but commented that what is going on in the Senate showed that people were "slim and foolish and speaking unfaithful".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are mad and bad and unpleasant and speaking unfair," he said.
"When you look at publications and leakages and then say "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't.”
Do you think?
Dianne Feinstein, did you paint it?
Think of her answer... did you do the document--'Oh, uh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't do it.”
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't lake it, he added, while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the accusations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it became play earlier in September - but Feinstein refused to leakage from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's appeals, I didn't paint her history," said Feinstein to the committee, following The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I held it confidentially, as she asked."
But her refusal does not fall in good land with the President, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting, "I say you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.'
While he continues to defend the High Court nominated, who has been accused of bad sexual behaviour by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used the appeals for their own gain.
"They are determined to take back power in every way they see necessary.
You see the badness, the fault, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to gain power and control," said the President in the sequence of Mediaite.

Analytics create timeline over the night when women burned alive
The prosecutor presented all proof of Saturday under the ancillary case of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The U.S. Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett's analytic, witnesses several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.

Children's passport in New York inquiries pairs for kicked for "racist" text message
A pair of children in New York is prosecuting a couple to give her a dismissal based on discrimination after receiving a misleading message from the mother who complained that she was "and a black person."
The pair has refused to be racist and compared the prosecution with "depressing".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother to two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the childcare she had assigned, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
‘NEEEEEEEEEEEI, ENDA A SWORT PERSON’, wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, he sent to the childcare officer Maurice, twice.
After her mistake, the unfit Plasco-Flaxman gave the childcareman Maurice kicked, and said that the previous childcare, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job, so now she would have someone from the Philippines, following The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in an Uber.
No prosecutor Maurice's couple to get compensation for giving her kicked, and she'll have $350 a day for six months for her job, even if it was without contract, where she was going to bow with the family.
"I'll show them that it's not good to do this," she said to The New York Post on Friday, and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple refused that they were racists, and said that giving Maurice the fire was the only thing they could do after having offended her, because they were afraid that she came to take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
It's not a racist.
We're not racists," said the husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you're offended care for your children, even if you didn't mean to offende them?
Your newborn baby?
Think of it.’
Plasco compared the prosecution with "depressing" and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Shall you really go to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a good thing to do," said the investor Plasco.
While the matter is done, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, and criticized them for their behavior and logic.
The author behind the Paddington books was afraid that people didn't like a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
The daughter of the author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: "It's hard to see how it was to read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know no how successful Paddington stayed.»
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the stupid teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed feelings during his 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
In case of Paddington, which she describes as "a very important member of the family," she made her father proud of the inside of how great success he did.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never shouted," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like having children that achieved something: you'll be proud of them even if it's not really you're standing behind.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his creature and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on my phone.

"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't think she came to do it," said Ednan-Laperouse.

And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I'm so happy with you, dear you.
I'll be here soon to be with you.
I'll be there soon.
The medicines had given her so that her heart would continue pumping was slowly going out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was about to turn off.
I just sat there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't screame or screame, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now sad about the loss of her daughter, had to go on board the aeroplane with other passengers who did not know what she had just passed through.
"Nobody knew any things," said she.
‘I set my head bowed while the tears fall.’
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how glad he was in her.»
Sad women hang on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their dear who took suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have the party notes on a bridge in Wales that will inspire and make people who intend to take suicide to re-determine and call the numbers of the notes.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to struggle with depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I know every day."
Davis, 45 years old and cage in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that infects.
"All he knew because of his smile.
They said his smile lighted up all rooms."
But before he died, he stopped at work, because he was in a "very dark place."
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was the first one who found Tyler after he had taken his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still worried that the liver may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "that people should know that there were other people out there who care and who they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone – you have to talk to someone.»
Humphreys, who has been the friend of Davis for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told him he was tired or depressed or anything," she said.

She said that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continued to work through the dream, "There is a big space in our family now.
We're completely ruined.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts the investigation
"I thought that if we were actually getting something similar to what he asked for – a limited investigation – we might be able to gain some unanimity," said Flake on Saturday, and added that he was afraid of the committee "fell together" in the middle of a partisanar backlock.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They're embarrassing because of the timing.
The intermediary in the United States is only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans do not do well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the US Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House of Bush and was introduced for his wife Ashley in that way, then was the secretary of Bush.
What happens when the FBI presents his report?
They're going to cry in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can collect at least 50 voices in the Senate. With 50 voices, Mike Pense, Vice President of the United States, can give the last voice and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
Number of hops in North Korea 'Descending' under Kim
The number of North Korean jumps to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean lawgiver
Park Byeong-seug refers to data from the South Korean Department of Unity, and said there were 1127 jumps last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggler charges are the main reasons why the number has fallen.
Pyongyang hasn't spoken publicly.
Most of the hops from North Korea receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most refugees through China, which have the longest border with North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized son (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China looks at hops as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back with force.
The relationships between North and South Korea – as still technically in war – have improved in the last months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These conversations come after the historic meeting in June between the U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they became some about working for an atomic Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, U.S., ought not to achieve anything since then.
"Unless we can trust the United States, we can't trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we can't rest our weapons first," Ri said in a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says that he cannot be in the court of the High Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the US Supreme Court.
Pelosi calls Kavanaugh “hysterical” in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had acted in that way, she had been called "hysterical", Pelosi said about the evidence of Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and refused to claim that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening speech to Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and sometimes cried with a clump in his neck while telling about his family and the years on walking.
He criticised the democrats of the committee, calling the appeals against him "great and planned attitude to his reputation", organized by liberal politicians who were mad that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's evidence proves that he can't act in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is prejudiceful to democrats.
"I think he disqualifies his way and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi brought an objection when she was asked if she would try to make Kavanaugh leave if he was elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats reach the majority of the Representative House.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he can't be in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he's serving now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s federal court of appeal.
Pelosi also said that as a democracy, she is concerned about potential judgments from Kavanaugh against the lawful known as Obamacare and the case about Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is familiar with being a conservative judge.
In his hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions whether he came to turn certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiceful person in the Supreme Court who expects us to say that he's great," said Pelosi.
And women must swing the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of anger, and she doesn't get it out without crying.
"We grew when we're angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual, do you think?"
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high business position, who said that she grew when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she grew, "You might think I'm sorry because I greet.
I'm angry."
And then she just continue.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears act as a way to get out of mind, but there are many who misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from a former job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I was divorced of anger, and a woman who was older than me took me in my neck – she was a cold leader for whom I had always been alive - and pulled me out at the time.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
'They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and they won because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Congress Woman, a Democrat from Colorado at that time, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was taken on a boat called Monkey Business, and pulled herself from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought that she could as well stand still for elections as President himself.
"I hadn't really thought through it well enough," she said to me while she laughed, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates who made elections, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Snow white and the seven dwarfs.’»
Since the campaign had already passed for a while, she hadn't collected enough money, so she promised that she would only be quiet if she could collect $2 billion.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her support players who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they believe I get a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she didn't come to make elections anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and target the voices instead of the delegates, and anger against gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
"You would think I had a nervous collapse," said Schroeder about how the press reacted when she grew.
"You should have thought that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I think I thought, what are they going to write on my grave stone?
‘Ho branch’?»
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Peking
The opening salvage in the trade war between the United States and China was eagleous, and while the battle continued, a rim between the two countries can be a long-term advantage for Beijing, says experts.
The U.S. President Donald Trump first shot this year by taxing important Chinese export products, including solar cell panel, steel and aluminium.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth more than $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken home and set tariffs on between five and ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States for every shot they fire, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to fall down with the first.
In order to get Washington to end, China must do the way the United States wants, but turning to the United States is too embarrassed by Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing thinks the head, the American pressure can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependency between the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to fall under is more dangerous than people have to admit to earlier," said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing on Asia at the Center for American Security, a thoughtsmia.
Syria 'clear' for the return of refugees, says the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, and ask for help to rebuild the country destroyed after more than seven years of war.
When he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem said that relations in the country are making progress.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thank you for the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.

The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million acids have escaped from the country since the war began in 2011.
Additional six million people in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to accept help to rebuild the corrupt country.
But he stressed that they are not going to accept assistance or help with conditions from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe safe says in Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won Clearer Cup 2018 when they hit the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Cleaner Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown in that team to the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, reached the 14.5 points they needed to hit the United States.
The U.S. star Phil Mickelson, drew most of the tournament. He hit the ball in the water from the tea at hole 16, pair 3, and therefore gave the saying to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all its rounds and became one of four players who have ever been given 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was turned out 5&4 of the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, was 2 and 1 after the English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has shared in eight Ryder Cupar, became the most winning European with 25,5 points in career.
"I usually don't, but today I can't help.
It's been a tough year.
So thankful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said a emotional Garcia after the European speaker.
He goes on to the landman John Ram, who hit the American golf-leather Tiger Woods 2&1 in single game on Sunday.
"I know a huge pride in hitting Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all his four matches in France, and now has a merit list of 13-21-3 in Clearer Cup through career.
A strange statistics from one of the best players in the world, which has won 14 large titles and is only disabled by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struck to find the fairway throughout the weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the U.S. captain, said after a disappointing show from his team, "I am proud of these goods, they fight.
It was periods this morning that we made it hot for Europe.
I'm hitting.
The hatred for Thomas.
He's a unique captain.
All the 12 players played very good.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with PGA in America and our Cleaner Cup Committee and get us on.
I love these 12 goods and I'm proud of being Captain.
One must take the hat off.
We were rounded.’»
