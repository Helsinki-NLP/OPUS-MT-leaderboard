According to reports, India also hopes for a Defence Cooperation Agreement between the two nations.
Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds for fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was captured after the driver had driven it by 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic politicians in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after they observed it as it left a tank station on the Batdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and went on the Burgess Road before he bow down to the bushland where the officials lost it.
The motorcycle as well as a person who matched the description of the driver was later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accuses a 20-year-old man of disregarding a stop signal as well as unreasonable driving.
He was to appear before the Court of Justice in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and captured for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands before court because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing from the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of having raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The prosecution is that Webster attacked her while she was "conscious, slept, and could not signal consciousness."
Webster is also suggested to have raped a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highland on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating date for 17 November at the Supreme Court of Edinburgh.
Recovery to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congress members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have submitted a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as citizens' law.
"As trade unions die, the middle-class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and vice-president of the Progressive Caucus at the Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the employee authorization law together with the civil rights icons John Lewis.
This roadbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities in discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops the forces which are thus anti-discriminatory.
The complementation of the national labour law to create a possibility of discrimination to organise a trade union representative to complain before a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation for damage or penalties - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not in accordance with American standards.
Actually, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors suggest is to make the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the relapses to which trade unions have been exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries across the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, expand and maintain labour rights.
There was a time to remember millions of Americans when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and the law of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarized autocrate Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the role of workers and their trade unions in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers are guaranteed for association and joint negotiation and trade."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff forced the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers had to organize themselves and their voice should be raised in the new nation, the Germans added a clause explicitly saying: "The right to establish associations to ensure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed for each individual and every profession or industry.
Agreements restricting or aiming at declining this law are zero and non-profit; the measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Human Rights Commission, from which the General Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as it was accepted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors provided a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect or join them."
Since generations, Americans have accepted the basic premises that labour rights are human rights.
When this country discussed how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union then should be protected in collective negotiations as an equal partner with companies and government bodies.
Indeed, after these rights in America have been put under jurisdiction, it is very wise to reconsider the American ideal, so the working people must have the right to unite themselves and to hear themselves in a free and open society.
As pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the movement of workers did not restrict the strength of the nation but increased it.
By increasing the standard of life of millions of people, work has wonderfully created a market for industry and raised the whole nation to an incredible level of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves them.
The story recalls, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and enlargement of the protection of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employees' representations - is overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have raised America in the past and incorporated the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporarily the law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force to close
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, who said that it probably led to the closing of all five abortion clinics of the State.
This measure, which was raised by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and was to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out abortion to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that the doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions on a provisional basis while applying for such a law.
"The applicants can continue to work in law while seeking to achieve these rights," wrote Bundesrichter John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing shall be made for the judge to make a more permanent decision for the law.
Adolescents welcomed the decision to make recent decisions against similar measures in a number of cases and said that doctors would win the more time to obtain hospital instruction rights.
"The present decision means that the women in Louisiana are avoiding a deceitful law that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the State to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two hospitals who had not attached to the appeal and also requested invoice rights.
Louisiana is one of the 11 countries who have adopted similar laws, where courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutionally.
Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abtreatment advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that instruction rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Abtreatment counterparts oppose the protection of women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only one physician who is conducting abortions in Louisiana has the right to know the patient, informed the Centre for Reproduction Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to stop abortion, this doctor would no longer carry out the surgery in fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the judgment, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would not punish any doctors for the execution of abortions, while their applications would still be dependent on the right to file patients.
Delayed diagnostics and lack of access to the best treatment possibilities lead to higher death rates by ovarial cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have an online video home for her mother who died of eggstock cancer in 2007.
For women in Australia's rural areas there is a higher risk of dying on eggstock cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women, where eggstock cancer was detected in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
CLEINE STUDY: New medicines could slow the lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing diseases and the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For elderly women and those whose cancer had already advanced at the diagnosis time, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city died with a higher probability of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres than possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological uncologens, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedical services in order to counter the distances, she proposed to strengthen the service of infected doctors in order to allow specialists to provide women closer at their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical status, the study showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer and stressed the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013 Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years old, learned of the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of eggstock cancer.
Garden centres regret decreasing house ownership
The decline, together with an increased decline in the number of household owners under 35 years of age, could result in the loss of tens of thousands of pounds per year of garden centres when today's young consumers reach the "Kernelter Group for Garden Products" after a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that renters spend on average 55 percent of the amount spent on people with a home for their garden.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular procedures, asphalting gardens for parking purposes, and the falling garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which estimated 5 billion pounds per year are implemented in sales.
In the large London area, where the share of household owners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure for garden products is mentioned per household.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can't draw plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Advisor for the RHS, said: "Container gardeners are very popular for renters, for example, because they can take their plants on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "Golden Age" of garden single trade due to increasing home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also predicted a improved market situation for this year because of the better weather according to unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement referred to by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergy Tahirul Qadri in Pakistan continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1000 demonstrators have stormed the public television broadcaster PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters from PTV buildings again.
The transmitter set up its operation for about 40 minutes, but is now sending back.
At the same time, about 3000 demonstrants tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About one kilometre away, they delivered with stacks and stones equipped collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's withdrawal, but he rejects it.
The army of the country therefore calls on a political solution to the conflict to "suspend without time and use without violence".
After a meeting in the mainquarters on Sunday evening, the military informed: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the State."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent.
The opposition politician Imran Khan calls on Prime Sharif to have betrayed Parliament's elections last year in May.
The protests were escalated in the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to enter Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey's subscription of US diplomat for spy reports
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the U.S. official diplomats for information on a report on American and British spionage in Turkey.
Vice-President Bülent said that the business officer of the U.S. embassy and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German Magazine Der Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former U.S. analyzers of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, showed that Turkey was a main activity area for US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries spioned each other.
A previous report that also had the most important secret service in Germany's Ankara in the vision provided for a significantly more angry response from the Turkish government.
Warningstreik: Locators threaten with consequences for Pendlers
On Monday evening, the low-wide warning of the locomotive leaders could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The termination announced for 18 to 21 a.m. on all transport companies, including remote, regional and S rail transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is the freight transport.

said the district president of the German Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We're expecting significant failures.
Regional focuses do not give it.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.
The German Railway in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it is difficult to see the consequences concretely.
Police Chief of Magaluf of Corruption accused
On Friday, the prosecutors submitted proof of depression by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca.
The head of the police of Calvià on the Mallorca island was arrested after corruption claims by businessmen and bar owners in the famous Binge drinking hotel Magaluf.
Colonel José Antonio Navarro was inspected by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most bars and night clubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online daily newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented to the office of the prosecutor for corruption fighting Mallorcas on Friday proof of depression by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
Two other local policemen were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in conjunction with corruption claims and are consulted together with Navarro by a judge.
The national Spanish newspaper ABC reported that the angry night club seats said that the vetter economy of the authorities has a serious impact on their businesses.
"It's no longer about money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our life base out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
This summer, Magaluf made international slopes on the basis of a viral YouTube video, showing an 18-year-old British tourist who drove on 24 men during a swig tour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholized vacations in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the announced alcoholic tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Knepentour organizer Carnage together must pay a penalty of €55.000 ($73,000).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British vacationists, is also known for a number of accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "Balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has made South Australia a winter surprise, with violent shoes and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21 a.m., another 5mm rain fell on the city after 6.6mm, which had already gone down on Sunday in the night.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy actors, including a castle that started just 20 p.m. and provided almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided a early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell back to a maximum of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The weather conditions are likely to lead to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19.30 p.m., but was hit by a sharp wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
At that time, windshots reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane also had to start on a second landing flight and eventually set up at about 20.40 a.m.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including an emirates flight from Dubai and a quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide a maximum temperature of 16°C has been predicted on Tuesday, with possible viewers.
Matthies says: Highest time for big networking
Given the galoppy technical progress that threatens to transform our pleasant home to high-tech centrals, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting with a highly confident electronic accessories.
While I write this, my look at the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind it: if the cable wasn't, all listeners would fly around in the house in the shortest time, and that would be more retro.
Without prejudice to the echotronic (ekeltronic?
No, typing error: electronic) sector the rule that today's world innovation is the electric scratch of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And, for example, who today has a tube TV in the living room, who simply says that he basically rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressing of the Ifa on the radio tower this week again leads us to our absolute incompetencies in electronic matters.
The laie, who was blindly dominated by the former washing machine and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread with incredibly fragile expert speech before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises the press office.
Yeah, are you all right?
What do you want to talk about with people who seem to be voluntarily spreading such quarkers?
In fact, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about the fact that we should be able to connect our house.
So the yoghurt will order himself to inform us on the Maldives during the holiday that it burns in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we came from the office from the air conditioning on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, this requires a air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly be true soon: We lift our armband watch, you say, "Suck!" - and at home the dust-saugroboter goes.
Wrong.
Everything goes on to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown product are fading," is a industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glass shows how long the pizza in the oven needs, but nothing is useful because we stand in the dust.
We also know from the daily practice: when a newmodic device is really needed urgently, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israel's children from the areas near the Gaza strip returned to schools on Monday after they spent the summer in air protection rooms, while rocket and murder heritage commissions went down on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools remained closed in Gaza while the area was recovered from the battle.
The school start brought the communities in the south of Israel a sense of joy and expectation, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the employee of the "Pashosh" children's garden, which was hit by a rocket, before the students arrived from the walls and shining walls.
"We're a little scared, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, resident of the Kibbutz Saad and there English teacher.
Many children from our area need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little strange" to go back to school.
"There were difficult times, and we didn't go out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a weapon restoration the war last week, thousands of inhabitants of border communities, such as seeds, remained in their homes or left their houses to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and murder fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border of Gaza, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian maze granate, still hesitates with the return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Your children were preliminaryly placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town of Gaza, which is hardly drawn by the Palestinian commission.
He appealed to the children to learn much and said, "We will ensure that you get knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited arbitration on the last Tuesday.
The arms rest provided an immediate end to fighting; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as the demand of Hamas for abolition of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the re-opening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel demands a disarmament of the Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the battle.
A new round of indirect conversations is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel objects to this information and estimates that at least half of the killers are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai workers, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4.591 rockets and murder granates during the battle to Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250 000 people sought refuge to more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into preliminary protection rooms.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in protective spaces and continue fighting, the educational authorities last week moved the beginning of the school year.
"I hope the school is opened again soon so that we can continue learning, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD ban procedure
In view of the losses of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has made a statement before the Federal Constitutional Court for an end of the current NPD ban procedure.
Berlin - According to the CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban procedures against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU Head of Land in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a delightful development in the right direction and a development that is rather the result of fighting the NPD politically rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD was very closely failed at the five-percent horizon during the Sunday vote.
A first call for a ban on the right-extreme party was failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection had also been in the NPD peak informants at that time.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new request in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees are now placed in tents at the newland place.
The Central First Capture for Refugees in Harburg is located from all the nights.
Now the interior authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross at the same side.
The district politicians were informed just a short time before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to be reserved by the citizens and do not give the district politicians the opportunity to contribute constructively to the human housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, group president of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Your party demands that the district administration of Harburg provide unused houses for accommodation at present.
96 refugees can be placed in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling at the first time are the storm of applicants - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide sufficient spaces in follow-up facilities.
Thus, many refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
House prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
Due to this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is at 4.2 percent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not equally distributed across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne drive a two-part market.
The figures of RP Data show that the house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent last year, but in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices increased by five and six percent in average.
The other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been severely affected by the cuts in government expenditure and where prices increased only by 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless continued to say that at the beginning of the spring, there would now be an increase in the real estates to be sold, which would be "a real test" on the market.
"If you consider the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest environment, it is likely that the home prices will continue to increase in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of the Executive Director of Peer Medau and attests this to position "as a field master".
The style of the university is not this, says the Communication.
Thus, the Medau family was already "in mid-June orally informed about the minds of the university.
The statement that the plans were known only in July is definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points to the fact that the plans are not "preliminary or even decisions", but "presidencies".
The development of the narrow road up to the castle for access is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
From a nine meters wide road and is not the talk.
It goes at the current level by 5.50 meters, which is a meter wider than ever," explains Pötzl.
The argument of Medau operators that their free and educational parking areas will then only be used by students at the University in the future, Pötzl does not want to apply.
Togeparked is not at all because it can be solved intelligently as with other public parking spaces.
Remember the residents
The children's cripple of mountains, which is located on the ground and would lead the access to the park deck by their door, according to the university president, "not to be affected".
Instead, he is to consider, "that this is not only about the children's crib, but also about the residents of the incorporation to the Friedrich Straib Street and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So it is much more than the Particular Interests of the Gentlemen Medau," said Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent council of the children's crisp, with the expansion of the street, would be "the few naturally perpetrated spots of Coburg" would be entitled to "the reader can decide itself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the National Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the city councils about the building development of the university by 2020 "and in this context respond to the importance of the new discovery".
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the child crib about the plans of the university.
Thus, the access to the new park deck is not intended to lead through the campus and the Friedrich Street, but through the Medau Mountain.
To this end, the narrow road would have to be expanded at about one kilometre long two-track.
According to Medaus's high-calculations, the traffic in the Park of Hoogenfels would make it tenth.
Of about 2000 vehicles every day, it is spoken.
From the sides of the city, one has not yet wanted to comment on the project.
Glandorf withdraws from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Federal Ligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt raised in particular health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it was mature over several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the World Master of 2007 announced on his Facebook page.
Thus, he has a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 gates for Germany in international retirement.
Because the wrestling backspace player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go to Torejagd for a few years, he is no longer available to the new Federal Trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the island, which announces its border on Tuesday for the country games against Switzerland, Glandorf led a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have enthusiasmed me as they will enthusiasm my long-term fellow players and my followers.
But for my club, I would like to be healthy available in the next few years, for this, there are longer periods of regeneration that do not allow the current dual load.
The left hand had to fear his career after a chicken infection in 2012.
He had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Association (DHB) with a cortison syringe, which later caused a strong inflammation.
One emergency surgery and two more interventions followed.
Glandorf had then announced a complaint against the team doctor, which ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven-year national team career does not pass any body without delay.
I have some health buildings that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot surgery, which took place in 2012 in short intervals, I never got my blood pressure right.
There are some other pain-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I can't control my head, my body can't mislead," Glandorf explained in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
For a comeback, he'd only be ready in absolute emergency.
"If all the stripes are scratching, I'm always ready to speak," explained the double family father to the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble in my health.
After my career, I would like to go at least a little bit straight.
In addition to the 2007 WM title and the win of the Champions League in 2014, he picked up the EHF Pokal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, Flensburg also secured the Europe Pole of Pocals.
German economy decreased by 0.2 per cent in spring
The crises around the globe have braked the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the prequartal.
This communicated to the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed provisional calculations.
The economy lived in spring alone, while the investments fell.
The external trade also braked the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual uptake, for the first half of the year, a total GDP rate of 0.8 per cent is compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the target of the "Münsterland-Móoste", which led the first time on Sunday through the Burgmannsstadt.
The Burgmannstadt Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling sports association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterland-Mooeste".
It is the largest bike tour across Münsterland, the cyclist paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants thanked themselves with their registration at Jos ter Huerne for the organisation of this round trip through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested people in various magazines.
We come from The Hero and we've driven overnight to take part in this tour.
We also want to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the bike drivers rejoiced the route through the circles Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the Vereinsheim der Schützenbrüderschaft Sta.
Katharina went to a small "friedensfahrt" through the city across the wall, where the start also took place.
Furthermore, the route, which was written for three different categories, led back to Horstmar in the direction of Herrenholz over the Schöpinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and Havixbeck and Bildbeck.
On distances of 95 kilometers with 1175 height meters, 120 kilometres with 1475 height meters and 145 kilometres with 1775 height meters, the bicycles proved their good condition.
They were arranged on their way in Havixbeck and picturebeck.
The main organizer Jos ter Huerne and Mayor Representative Heinz Lölving was very pleased about the success of this bike sport event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all stakeholders.
The organization survived without problems and there were no negative events," Heinz Lölving draws a positive feature of this event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organiser had hoped, which probably was at the bad weather forecasts and in the morning rain.
"We see us again in 2015 at hopefully beautiful weather on August 30 or during another weekend," however, the bike drivers promised to return to Münsterland and the organisers plan a new edition.
Constantine Wecker's honest memories
It is more philosophical witness than biography, which has brought Constantine Weaker, Songmaker, Pasifist, Polite-safe Activist, Ex-Haftling, in "Munch and Warer" to paper on 287 pages.
Not chronological but more thought feet for thought feet, the coin born on 1 June 1947 wrote his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text.
And he is unfairly honest: from the onanie as a gymnasian to the shop stealing and drug use he does not leave human weaknesses.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also takes abstract, but the more important terms: love, soul, ego, Being in Now, Spirituality - all of this he is trying to go on the ground in very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his societal criticism, his political engagement - and as he has not only characterized music (the opera lover became a Soul and Rock musician), but also his jail stay.
Last time, the Lebemann Constantine Wecker has also brought closer to the asketic monk, which is "through subtraction", as he says, "by leaving all unnecessary."
Between all the high spirit views, however, there are also short anecdotes to earth: such as over beatings in a frequently frequent local or violent carriage, where he showed a tree frontal.
Even there he is unfairly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry is proud of a comedie, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on a imaginary conversation with his father and came from the series on radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with live melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" treatments after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just listened to his voice, "Look up with the crack.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown when I was a child - went into the knee with him and talked about things like the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner that read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a casting in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at his father's time, he won an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little bright now, but they're dark, smoked, deep sweat labyrinth with flames and smoke and lots of rust.
My father just put himself in the cabin and then man could slowly hear him start singing because he was able to wash the poultry from himself.
When I walked around there, I realized that he had done it for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him became greater.
Yet, Henry grew up as a child without his parents’ testimony.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was bad at the end of her life, we began to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop embraceing me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still friends with French, with whom he was married 25 years of age.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I pulled this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's hard.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short-cut bart.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he was taken by the theater.
It followed the coma of errors, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and commodities who have filled his working life.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His TV career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitation/Comedian on TV for a rather long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to get larger not only in the eyes of the public, but also learning from 1975 to 1985 how I could become a efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through the television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
As his manager had the stage law at the Black and White Minstrel show, a light entertainment program in which the people painted themselves "black", Henry took up his comedy there over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish it would never have happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of price-crowned light pillar of British television" was also a "great-scale parodie of black people."
By the introduction of figures that the British black culture both spotted and celebrated, Henry worked in the eighths at an alternative comedy circle.
The first series of the Lenny Henry show went to the shipment in 1984, and in the ninetys, he was known as the kitchen chief Gareth Blacklock in the Comedy Series Chef!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series and film roles marked his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just bringing the time or getting a little in place."
Afterwards a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare I was regularly allergic.
I had never learned anything about him at school, and I thought it was mainly a domain of the middle class, whites in pants and a coal head in front of it.
So I was very afraid of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't hurt if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry made 20 lines of Othellos' last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I felt that I could do this.
It was almost like someone would have put my head right at last.
"That's about it, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, search a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the commodity of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to enter the audience.
"A little voice said to me, "You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage leader announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for it.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the visions.
This also came well, so it's like a big sign of the gods who say to me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.
So I'll stay with you.
I really love that.
I love being in a sample room.
Henry still has the head of a comediate - our conversation has been pursued by humorous outbreaks, while he repeatedly imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy, because I find this kind of immediate satisfaction from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you're always looking for that, you're riding a wall.
I sometimes appear live in the Apollo, if I want to do so, but totally there's not as much as I did before.
I'm asking him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actress.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Jemens capital
In the conflict between Shithian Huthi rebels and the Yemenian government, the Huthis called on civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi adherents would have occupied central roads in Sanaa on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi Party "Ansar Allah".
The access to Parliament has also been blocked.
Yemenitic media report of a transport chaos in the capital.
According to the online release of the "Yemen Post" newspaper, Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened with a further escalation of the conflict, according to the magazine, should not meet his demands.
The Shitian Huthis struggle for more independence from the sintically ruled Jemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The national tribe of the Huthi has been camping the Jemenite capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access routes of Sanaa.
In the surroundings, there are always bloody fights with the Jemenite army.
Kenia registers officials to prevent "aspirant employees"
Kenya has begun to register all government officials biometrically to remove "geist employees" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid were a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people are still receiving wage payments even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service in 2013.
At the beginning of this year, it was found that at least 1 million dollars (700.000 pounds) per month were lost in payments for "aspirant workers" and other violent financial practices.
The government suspects that wages will continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must now appear in identification centres in the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data on biometric registrations are recorded, was reported in a government message.
All those who did not do this without a credible excuse were deleted from the paylist were continued.
"With this approach, the rationalisation of the public service is essential by determining the actual number of officials and also pursuing the pay list at both government levels - then "the spirit employees" will be eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary of the Decentralisation and Planning Ministry.
The scandal around the art consultant Helge Achenbach is first negotiated before court on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi-Gründer Theo Albrecht, demand in a civil process at the Düsseldorf Country Court 19,4 million Euro damage compensation from Achenbach and two of its companies in insolvency procedures.
This announced a court speaker on Monday.
The complaint says that Achenbach deceived the purchase of artworks and old-time hours and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher than actually paid purchase prices.
This would also result in a higher level of provision agreed.
Achenbach has purchased value items for 121 million euros for Albrecht.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years old in school, 23 of whom was the head of school.
From this time, Manfred Richter knows many standing Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always weared by his striving to see the people in the students.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountain.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordbohmen, today Trutnov.
At 14 years of age, he was interested in the teacher occupation after four years of education.
One year later, the Sudetdeuts were released.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bayern - in the goods wagon in 1946.
So it swallowed judges into the Upper Finnish Senkendorf.
Teacher education took place in Bamberg.
To this end, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers a week to the next railway station, traveling to Bamberg, there going three kilometres across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter received a sleeping situation in a red-creuz home in Bamberg, together with up to 15 students in a bedroom.
In 1951 he made the first and 1954, after three years of education, the second state exam.
Since he had no free teacher office, Oberfranks went to Oberbayern and came to Kollbach School on November 1, 1954.
The "fruline room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he included a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69, these were summarized in Petershausen at today's council.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the town.
To avoid a reclassification in the now smaller school, then director Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to relate to today's building, which was extended in 1997 after Judge's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the mayor Ludwig Götz at that time, who made additional work rooms and the extension of 1997, although this was not eligible under the school building directives.
"Bürgermeister Götz was very school-friendly," recalled judge grateful.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government representative who answered to a referendum of a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget the love." Manfred Richter turned what he had heard there as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two ways: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to know, "That doesn't always work." Whether he meant his student or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students were strangering, he did not get a criminal work and was not consumed to sit down.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had made two pairs of box gloves and let the two contrahents go against each other, even if there was to be a violet.
For the benefit of the school, judges maintained a good relationship with then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the parteilos judge after his retirement to submit at least 1996 as the last on the CSU list for the municipality council.
However, Judge was elected at place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4 RADTOUR 700 bicycle drivers place in the course park of Bad Salzhausen and Scots Intermediate stops
When bicyclers make barbecue on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots, this is nothing special at themselves.
On Friday, however, only the number of racings impressed: The 700 participants of the hr4-Radtour and Begleitross enjoyed a break in the lower Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the free sky in the Oldeburg Park.
Under the motto "Radling and celebrating on newly discovered ways between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and had a concert of Van Baker & Band there.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists attacked the first stage, 60 kilometers from Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was started with the bike in Bad Vilbel, and the leader of the self-operative Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and spirit, all kinds of good things had been prepared: The farmwomen from Ranstadt and Low Mux City had 85 sheets of apples, sweats, cheese and cheese cooks baked, which wonderfully made the crafty cyclists.
"Some cakes can only bake farmwomen," praised a participant from Aulendiebach while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshers were created at the drinking level of the tower club Gitt-Nidda.
The "Duo Bravo" interviewed the visitors with known melodies from operetts and musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambient of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage of his partner: "The one he deserved, finally he has re-fixed already kicked bicycle chains."
Therefore, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the well before the Trinkkhaus by Reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
The promotion manager Tobias Hagen also, since the first hr4-Radtour in 2004, was able to sniff a short time, but he had a lot to do with the technology on the site.
His pickup truck, in which he wrote Facebook entries and made reportages using three phones and a radio device with his employees and the 15-headed motorcycle truck of the police Hessen also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhein-Main area," he said, "but also from casting or fulla, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from many cities in Westfalen are cyclists.
The number of participants is a bit adjusted to the available overnight capacity.
In Category I, the participants are placed in hotels, in category II in collection accommodations.
The cyclists had a good impression from the curriculum when they broke up again after one and a half hours: "Bye!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they whinted for goodbye.
After arrival in Scots, the group was allowed to put a short break.
But in the evening, the cyclists were demanded in the idyllical Alteburg Park.
Under the government of the Scott Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS) the park had received a beautiful festival, and of course it had been prepared to make fun, such as flame cakes with well-cooled feather white.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS business leader Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sach in his role as CEO of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were apparently pleased with the "many operation in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
Despite the sports exercise on the bike, the opportunity to move freely in the sky has been eagerly used.
Among the guests increasingly mixed citizens who had been affected by the good atmosphere as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, for the cyclists, the stations Birstein, Guardsbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenwalders - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of bicycle, the sportsmen met back in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", reports local media agencies.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they were supposed to have founded an organized criminal association and set up telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Reep Tayip Erdogan (which was then Prime Minister) described her course as part of the activities that the Islamic clergy Fethula Güllen against him and other persons in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had opened again, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held at every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere across Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slavjansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here again and that the children will receive education that will be useful for them in future life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wear coated shirts, keep balloons in their hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It enters with a proud roaming drag from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consultancy Bain and Co., which she switched to Morgan Stanley, Bombbadier, ICI and Pearson's media world.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and returned when the top post of Pearson's parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Their finding was supposed to be nearly 1 million £.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when he was looking for more private economic knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant of the cabinet.
Your husband is a former Tory Council member.
I already described the chairman's duty with a poisoned cock in May.
Not only stands the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inside on the first garden of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as the voice of public concern and disturbance when things go wrong.
This ensures a almost unsustainable duopol, which requires a complete reform.
But what new incoming chairman would risk getting into everything and dismissing an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps bringing himself to his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if it weren't enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overcome.
While the competition is closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient security, the upcoming negotiation of licence fees for BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of 145.50 pounds per year, the British public is purchased into the definitely largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells us a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them costs only 40 pences per day.
And apparently the BBC rises up again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The view and use habits for the BBC have changed: I get today news matches on my mobile phone and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loved and considerable institution.
She needs an outstanding chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that the droping Tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, contained a decline in comments on the democratic district prosecutor, which is at the centre of a criminal charge against him because of abuse of official violence.
The Tweet was deleted later and replaced by another by Perry's user account that cancels the previous one.
Just a tweet has been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the Tweet and have deleted it," it said in the later news.
The staff of Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually serves the feed.
In the former Tweet, a unfavourable picture was drawn of the district prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was condemned in April 2013 for drinking on taxation.
Perry introduced a veto against financial support of her office when she refused to withdraw, which could lead to a charge against Perry - which may be a presidency candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the Tweet is: "I don't always drive drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol level ... but if I do so, I complain to Governor Perry when he's pouring it out."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge of the headquarters of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was directed by Michael McCrum, a Special State Attorney from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry is not guilty and called the accusation a political trick.
His high-quality team of jurisdiction applied for the judge in charge of the case to reject the accusation and argued that the law against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally different.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government money to the Public Integrity Unit of the State - resident in Travis County and determined in cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint from a left-hand watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After completing the elections in Iowa during his presidential candidatur in 2012, Perry accepted speculations that he would stop by posting a twitter of a photo of himself when jogging near a lake with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley again explains the housing market as "normal"
One of London's most prominent construction companies pointed out that the housing market in the southeast of England was "reverted" to a normal level.
Homes in the capital were warmly desired and subject to huge price increases, which the Bank of England, due to the widespread fear of a blast of credit, moved to set upper limits for mortgage credits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's high-class construction company, said on Monday: "Since the current financial year started, the market has returned to normal transaction level since the maximum of 2013," and added that this offers a "stable environment of action".
The real estate market in London was well established during the decline, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information provided by the catalyst, prices in the city area alone have increased by 18.5 per cent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices for Berkeley's private, price-valued and student offers increased by about one fifth in the last year and were by 423,000 pounds at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has in recent months made property property less attractive for foreign buyers in London - some of them have also been distressed by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetorics for a possible "payer tax" before the general elections in the coming May.
The London real estate maker Foxton warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which more stringent credit grant schemes were presented, would also lead to a lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decrease in the hypothesis authorisation in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 to 3 percent, based on a already weakening home price consciousness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has decreased by a quarter per year, says the Maker WA Ellis.
Yet, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts for the sale of appointments amount to more than 2.2 billion £.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, the sales of the appointments have remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year until the end of April - nearly one third more than the maximum in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual precautionary result increased by 40 per cent annually to 280 million pounds, the turnover by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion pounds.
In a communication on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley would be expected to meet the current market expectations for the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual precautionary result to 450 million £.
In the afternoon, Berkeley shares were fixed at £23.96 in the London trade.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appears at the 85th Oscar award.
Naked photos of the Oscar Prizemaker Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained about the hacker for "equatorial injury to privacy".
The authorities were informed and will follow all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were supposed to be created by a gap in the iCloud online storage system of Apple. The supposed "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took up in the private environment of our house years ago - I hope you are so very satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonseries "iCarly" and "Victorious" dismisses the pictures of her and twisted "These so-called naked pictures of me are pleasant, people.
Let's fight the beginnings. *Worthplay planned*.
Buzzfeed reported the late Sunday that a speaker of the Popstar Ariana Grande dismissed the authenticity of the claimed photos from her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly vowed new novel about love and the letter "J".
So you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a carton that you have left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, strangerous, intense, distant and maybe somewhat thorough.
And then shook his hand.
He knew Kratzburstig.
He was stumbling, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stupidity was a just beginning affair that had been much more promising for the relieving of the lonely long - suffering of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomon's was a ridiculous, delicate beauty with uncovered hair and a flattering heart from a village on the north island, which was even more remote and harder than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older accompanying who held Kevern for her aunt, and who had inherited a land in a moist but paradise valley with the striking name Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaking, in the bathrooms there were still spines, neck snakes had left their tracks on all windows and believed they belonged to all this, and the garden was overwhelmed with unclean, which looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a child marrow, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be published in the next week.
Kevern had been sitting handy with Ailinn on the broken lounge chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both of them had clinged away into the service console that provided the country with calm music and soothing news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer who would have listened to his father at closed rolling shops in the home.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggression, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - Nothing was so right prohibited - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, as the word obsolete.
The general taste created what the adoption and regulations had never succeeded, and as people in books chose the From-Teller Washer-Tum-Millionary Memoirs, Cook Books and Love Romans, they chose the ballades in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play a imaginary piano and sing in a gross-comic serenade of Ailinn's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"That was a well-known song of a Jazzpianist named Fat Waller," he explained to her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without laying two fingers over your lips, it cost you a penny.
It hadn't been a very funny game at that time, and it wasn't very funny now.
He knew that this was expected by him, that's all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly forbidden.
Improving was no longer modern.
It was only space for one "if" in life.
The people wanted to be sure where they would end at the beginning of a melody.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was a musical expression of understanding.
Although he had become 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz about the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when Popsangers weren't black.
Again, there was no laws or forces.
A conform society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of grouping - thankful as spared by the destiny.
People with afro-caribic origin were suitable for entertainment and sport through temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as of nature and were responsible for ensuring that no family remained without working service phone.
What was left of the Polish community was careful of the channelization; what was left of the Greeks crushed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levantes whose grandparents hadn't quickly left the country as WHAT WAR, WENN WHEN it happened- out of fear to be accused of fireworns, even fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha pipe restorants, kept in mind and became depressive with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his skills.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was hard to understand how the insulting words that Kever had just sung her could ever be condemned.
Music was expression of love.
"They are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too large.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceitful feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound damping of the huge coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say it was a Jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
After all, she thought he was something weird.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head incredibly and blocked the vision of Kevern.
There was nothing else to see around the world than her uncovered raven black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," she meant without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you sing it to me.
You seemed really worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked back.
You don't have your feet right away.
Maybe your knobs, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my knobs are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but for that it was too early.
"Your thick knocks are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often brought into trouble because he like his father did not have the calm charm that was needed to count on the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father also wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to be that, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomon became red and lifted up from her liechair, threw the console and threw the wine they had drinked.
Hollow flower wine, so drinking wasn't an excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to shake like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason why I feel perverse to you," she said...
Except that I'm not.
She regretted him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and of the fear that was shown in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like this.
The same huge and ice-shell ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more dispersed after WHAT WHAT WHAT it had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from Kneipe to Kneipe, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or murdered them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn't care!
They first knocked - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attractive force between men and women, a counter-toxic to the non-saying love ballads from the console - they first knocked and then hit.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the cnutching itself was already a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He raised himself out of the lying chair like an old man.
She also felt bleeding, but the mourning of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They couldn't know.
She looked at him as he disappeared - as from a room in the upper floor her companion attended to him - a man, complained by something he had sworn up himself.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised her hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowed his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fight spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well if she couldn't remember one time she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was back alone, Ailinn Solomon looked at her feet.
Several years before the just reported events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative public atmosphere monitoring body, worked on a brief lecture on the continued violence at low and medium level in precisely the parts of the country in which their reduction, if not abolishing, would best be expected, in view of the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has already been done much, and much has to be done," she wrote, "to facilitate the inborn aggression of a people, leading thousand wars, and most of them have won, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human friendship has been seen historically despite the highly demanding church towers between the hills rarely.
But some qualities prove to be unwaitable.
The higher the church Tower, the less the passion it continues to wake up.
The population weeps when listening to sentimental ballads, insists on stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the former routine holds the rural communities as well as our urban areas firmly in the hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and deceitful conflict at home, at work, on the streets and even on the fields.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," said their mentor when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussboom dropped her head.
I also have to ask, are you atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum answered.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme called on her right to privacy and the refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Quiet again.
"I don't ask this," said Luther Rabinowitz at last, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a non-profit workplace.
We serve a non-profit society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are in itself absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort results as you have presented them.
They have obviously prejudices against the church, and these things you call "suppressive" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as well as expressions of natural force and vitality.
If you continue to move around, WHAT IS THE HEALTH, WHEN IT IS HEAS, as if if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the country its essential vital viability.
Esme Nussboom looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
At the back of his head, a LED writing train in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter of the year or more.
Smile to their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit Musicals, use their phone, talk, listen, agree, excuse yourself.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want out of," Esme Nussbaum answered with a quiet voice when she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effective healed as we see ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may recognise how we repeat the mistakes that are only to WHAT IS DOING, WHEN IT IS HEAS.
This time, however, it is not the other ones in which we leave our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an English patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "if you call actions as "defects" that our grandparents may have done or not.
You're going too far, too, if you're talking about that they'd have left their "worn" and their "misstrust" on "other".
In fact, it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about the understanding of the past, such as the protection of the present, not about "us" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From who, if we are honest to ourselves," Esme dared to throw in, "no part of society can claim to be well-behaviored.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it was bad or good done what happened has happened.
That was then.
We have no more to say - we agree.
And just as no debt has to be allocated, then no debt has to be cut if such a destruction would be appropriate and if there would be a way to devour them.
But what does the past mean if we don't learn from it?
The past serves to forget it.
If I can say something about that,
Luther Rabinowitz made his pyramid collapse.
"I'll think of her report," he said and left them.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was travelled by a motorcycle driver who, as described by passengers, had driven into a kind of "brutal anger" on the footway.
There are coincidences.
Lesotho Military Member says that no State is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho argued to have planned a state stroke to the government's crash and said that they were acting against policemen who were being disposed of the weapons of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane flew out of the country and informed that the army of the country surrounded its official seat and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the adjacent South Africa after he reported attack threats.
Major Ntlele Ntoi said that in fact, there is no state stretch, but the military responds to the threat of "political fanatics" whose weapons were expected by the police.
"What happened tomorrow was that the Staff of the Defence Forces of Lesotho acted after he had received several secret service reports that within the police were acting some elements that actually wanted to arm some of the political, partial young fanatics who were just before, to cause devastating damage," he said to the Voice of America.
The South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military action made the impression of a crash.
"Even if nobody has claimed to have ruined the government by violence, all reports agree that the activities of the defence forces of Lesotho have shown signs of a country," he said.
Talkers of the Military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers were pulling back into their chasernes and the situation in the capital is quiet.
In the meantime, the Vizepremier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government during Thabane's absence.
Thabane announced that he believed he had become a target disc because of his attempt to combat corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, there have been great tensions since June after Thabane's parliamentary sessions were suspended due to the disputes in his unity government.
He said that his actions wouldn't have undermined the government, otherwise blaming accusations in despite.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month depth
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down at the lowest point in the last 13 months, thus a thoroughly observed study.
The final market purchase manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, following a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 indicates an expansion.
New contracts went back and factories experienced incoming tensions between the EU and Russia across Ukraine.
The figures shall be entered before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect a clear plan for dealing with a delaying recovery of the eurozone and for the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further information during this week whether he considers a quantitative enlightenment for the Eurozone, according to those made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"But a small growth is better than no growth at all, the slowing effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more clear for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell at the deepest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the decline in Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications that growth in the key industrial mechanism Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer relaxing," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in the industry is likely to cut the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economy Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say to the purchase manager index of the production industry in the Eurozone is that the sector continues to grow afterwards."
He added: "Producers in the Eurozone are currently finding life quite difficult, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine - increase in uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and it is likely that some contracts are delayed or even cancelled, in particular large contracts.
He said that it will be "always more likely" that the ECB must eventually initiate a type of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
The hell decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible occupation of the school, as the children that have been broken there are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people from Czech militia were taken as hostages in a school in Beslan in South Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrium that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had died in the cruelty in the classroom.
Just a decade after the terrible settlement of the Beslan School, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night against a new Apokalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamic terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the evil of the wicked.
The tragedy united West and East into Abhorus, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst distress.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had died in the cruelty in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome opposition, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that the Ukraine now visits - and in the children like them die - now finds a end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt to get back to the broken school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she only tried in her underwear to get back to the crushed school sports hall after a mine had been exploded.
Aida was totally confused looking for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida then.
My legs were bloody.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a number of surgeries, she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday said: "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I have to be surgered again.
Some granate splitters are still in my knee.
Your goal is now to become a dentist to help the people how she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says campflowerly.
"This happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I'm always going to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva were killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I end my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the occupation will always remain part of it, although the memory will get slightly weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to that thing not happening again.
The boy who flew through the bullet hail thought his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Russen goes to school with 7 years of age) and survived the three-day camping in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me I should lay down when there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After a explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Lop."
They were afraid that they could be dead, he fled and saw a weeping baby on the way, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a ball hail.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara was stuck outside and with bone injuries in the hospital, on the other hand, in assuming that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
This was later flying to London (the newspaper of the World, which was now dissolved), to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to be bleak in my memory.
I remember that I just threw away all my toys guns afterwards.
But now I can play computer games with shots and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids with whom I played in the court and who haven't done it outside.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially to the play shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an upper open car.
But now he is afraid of the place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me of it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the grievous," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and I hope they'll take me to the school next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the camping, there were simply no children who could call and run around, and this silence took many months.
She recalls her journey to London with Damer.
The people in London wept when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her foundation thankful for the price and opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how the Damer and me helped.
I remember how Damer wanted to eat Borschtsch and called them all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with cellars in a restaurant. So he shot with his water gun on them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world has not become better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and still being killed.
These are just like our kids.
I think for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are boring or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
This became big and is a very soft and quiet boy, he's not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he is not seeking vengeance, he is not overwhelmed by the last wraths.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the sports hall and ignite there candles.
When he was smaller, he suffered - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, turning the face off from us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. This is now 17, larger than I, well-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came on my legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with all around the body parts.
I was absolutely sure my little boy could have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I got him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was so sure that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And that's how life, different from many others, goes on for us.
Georgia Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the occupation became the symbol of the grievous of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan surviving Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the camping in 2004, right a picture of Georgia today
His bloodflowed face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life, while Czech terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbaric of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had put him off for his first school day before she rushed to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer this date, the more difficult it is to think about and talk about it.
There's no one day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been long ago, I mean, yesterday, some scenes of these days are always following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intensive: The picture of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was evacuated as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgij wanted to go to school this day. He said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at our home in the book hall.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgia says today: "It is important that such something can never happen again.
"I doubt we've ever learned the truth.
People are repeatedly investigating such tragedy and never learning the truth.
And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes a terrible thing.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing about such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the camping, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I'm always going to the sports hall when the 1st September moves closer.
I want to pay my old childhood friend tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel as a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry.
My life goes on.
I completed the school this year and visited a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgia Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, although he was caught to feet of a murderable terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was caught to feet of a murderable terrorist during the settlement, but he managed to survive.
During the camping, he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderable terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but this was not possible because of his health damage due to the camping.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I am now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and felt something better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost the consciousness.
I will never return there again and don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivors: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the camping on the laptop
My pain is incredible and I wear it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my hurt knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the Secret Service Academy of FSB in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, also the medical, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about this, and they should not, of course, suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary goes closer.
I'll go to the festivals to remember.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much more vigorous for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It's staying in us.
Georgia is now a adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that if something so unfair happens.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but no sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will always persecute us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the camping, and this only strengthens my pain.
I lost many people that I knew well and that were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could make me, but my heart weeps about the dead.
I know about families in which new children were born, but also widows who have never married again.
It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can't believe that.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that in Ukraine many children have already been killed and many are still being killed.
If we could only grab and throw out all these rebels as far away as possible.
Aljona Tsjajewa, 10
The baby that has been carried in security by a special operation command.
Rescued: Aljona Tskajewa is put in security by a Russian specialization command (left).
She is now ten (right) and doesn't remember the cruelties at all
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the camp of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty, her 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar left in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonah’s mother and sister died in the murderous mess.
Her father Ruslan has married again since then and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana that he has called after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the camping and has grown into a intelligent and happy girl, says neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

4 Tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to make pictures or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a water density point and shot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which are both to have for about $300.
I took these photos at a family festival with several cameras, all available at a price of less than $350.
Depending on the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery basket and other fans are closely closed.
Also set your camera on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and Camcorder have scene and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the low underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras are only authorised for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping manager and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not work.
Point-and-shot cameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, action cameras usually not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to look at this under water, and the right image setting is a happiness case.
So you're doing a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a series mode, with which a series of recordings are made with mildly modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface if you take records in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to bring more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is even more important under water because of bad light conditions.
It is particularly important if you work with an action camera: these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things, even in a gigantic organization like the NHS.
As a consultant anaesthesia doctor, he devoted his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the qualities of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife remembers, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important about the diagnosis and diseases, while the treated people are mainly busy with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had trouble raising myself.
While he struggled with the grip-like symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Juliet impatient.
"I prefer everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Julia was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusual and unreasonable.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out a X-ray examination of his chest.
It was only two weeks ago that he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray investigation was present.
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an unhealable cancer that attacks the chestfell, that is, the skin overwhelming the lungs.
Like most cancers, the exact trigger is mostly difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancers have been smoking earlier.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is a asbestos load - contact with the fiber construction material, which was once considered "wonder" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can ignore as easily.
Asbest is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the United Kingdom since the 1960s than the industry voluntarily committed to stopping using it.
Even where he was still in place, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - clamps, construction workers, room workers and yardworkers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems hardly to be anxious today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems, experiences today the highlight of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths by Mesotheliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die in this disease as in transport accidents.
Annual numbers of mesotheliom deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in United Kingdom
The reason why we are now experiencing the fatal effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 all asbestos were banned), is that a mesotheliom develops only after decades.
And the cheating of the Mesotheliom is not limited to the former worker of the construction industry.
Asbest was, and is often still present in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the businesses in which we buy.
And therefore, Mesotheliom does not know any class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are no protection room.
Parliament's buildings are asbestosed.
Also in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, we have already been designed as the starting shepherd of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a clamper either.
Indeed, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with Asbest.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there were a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I graduated my training for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and Pfortner - use the tunnels.
You wonder how many of my agemates will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer at least partially.
"From the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital and who have been ill in Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last one who is still alive."
How many of us will still get sick?
Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48 in Andrew Lawson.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
This was an unusual long survival.
Fifty percent of all mesothelio markers die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question, "How many of us will still be ill?"
Great Britain’s leading expert at Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestopidemia in Great Britain is expected to occur, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be victimed.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they're going to die like that.

A brief look at the documents of the courts to which the interested parties often refer for claims on damage compensation, shows how far the cheating of the Mesotheliom is already widespread.
For example, in June this year, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that Janice Allen has dissuasively exposed asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagshipstore in the Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her business at M&S.
Now she has two kids in the twenty.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even know anything about asbestos.
I wouldn't have thought that would have happened to me.
There are only few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It has been used for roof plates, floor plates, pipe isolations, boile isolations, even for braking in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still considered by the EU and the WHO to be a "great health risk" with a possible death.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Great Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "the clear but indirect evidence that this was a key reason for the unique high mesotheliom rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliom, but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their history is not unusual at all.
He presented a study of the concerned, which shows that "a significant proportion of the mesotheliome was probably caused by work or asbestos contact in the environment without known suspension."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can go out of being safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been uncertainly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service stores and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose fatal fibers could be triggered by something as harmless as strong air movements.
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite.
While the Executive Board of Parliament's Labour Service claimed that the Westminster palace has received a "super health certificate", it is now unreasonable that 1 billion £ work is needed for several years to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, the Members will probably meet more in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "asbest's presence was not managed in accordance with the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do is wait.
A person who could never precisely determine contact with Asbest is Graham Abbott, a general medical doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abbot assumes he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places in which you worked, and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009 on which he got such a sort of fever.
He was 45 years old, and he had a surgery late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had a shake frog.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I could get the ride home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pains of the chestfell, the skin around his lungs were affected.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Awkward doctors made X-rays of his chest and put Pleurakathether on to extract liquid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after sports exercise and severe breathing.
In 2011 a patient abbott with similar symptoms came in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom.
But even now, this was not related to his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with Asbest.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition was worse again and his home doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings to a group of experts.
In December 2011, precisely two years after Abbot had felt sick for the first time, a soap equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the ribs and the breasthole.
I'm a optimist.
I'm usually going on," he says.
Honestly, I hadn't worried so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "It was told that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings were now ill.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in footway tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground candines (as Graham Abbott often did), came in contact with the toxic substances with the greatest probability.
It is shown that over several decades after the war hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He's gonna be removed today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, businesses, libraries and city halls due to its fantastic isolating and flame-hemming properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have put their bunsen burners on asbestos.
On websites, the theme asbestos is now frequently discussed in schools.
And so innocent objects in our houses such as floor plates or shove roofs have normally contained asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is included in large parts of our real estate," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that fell into an affected woman was the offrise of a garden ship in the 1970s.
So take care of how to cut off your gardeners.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealable is immense.
"It takes a while to handle this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to experience any more Christmas.
With the biggest difficulty, the perspective change from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he recalls how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to take up all that," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Well, I'm not going to experience any more Christmas.
It was then."
Mesotheliom is particularly fabulous because it is our lifekeeping mechanism - the breathing itself - that causes the fatal cancer.
Most of the cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos are twisted and the fibres are inhaled, they can be fixed in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the chest and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital, which Andrew Lawson presumes has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pressed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancer disorders do not work well in Mesotheliom.
For example, the efficacy of an operation is hotly controversial.
Some think she's worth an attempt.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut the chestfell out," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
However, the cancer is "not very good on chemotherapy," which "effect shows", but not healing.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Happyly, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a single-man support and consultancy agency for fellow people four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer centre," he imagined happy when calling.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and would probably extend his life only by one month.
"I was desperate," he said.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, made it possible "to make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-Thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had a advantage because I didn't have to be rejected, I just called and got a date," Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a transfer and wait for the authorisation of treatment.
Money is crucial for Mesotheliom-sickes to be able to take the best available treatments.
But if these treatments eventually fail, many people are concerned with another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s, it was realized that a very low burden also constituted a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally attached to their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full remuneration" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to a asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation to his death, a speaker of Guy confirmed that "asbest fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How Asbest can be removed
In fact, for Mesotheliom-sick people who are seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to assign a deadly asbestos contact to a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the applicants.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliom stakeholders to complain about compensation even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has established a 350 million £ fund fund funded by the insurance industry for all those diagnosed after July 2012, to prove a contact but no one can complain.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 percent of what a court could have said to them in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications in the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesothelioms that 350 million £ represented a "very good work" in the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time wouldn't have gone over and Mesotheliom-sickes could find the companies and complain normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister for Employment and Pension, also admitted that the law is "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that due to seven death victims daily, there was a need for rapid action.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom law in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended a surgery from which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that can present long-Lazdunski a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This is of course the most important thing," says Abbott.
You see that again and again in patients.
There's something that allows you to continue.
If you give up, you're getting worse quickly.
Graham Abbott signed the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
No signs of disease showed post-care cancer.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer flakes around my chest.
I just got 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Abbott again underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of tumours is visible.
But the process is physically and psychically very tough.
You have to think of practical things - about the money if I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16 and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents it's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I wouldn't be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very social and inconvenient.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more stumbling.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to suffer.
But for Mesothelio-marketing people such conversations are not made by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) a cruel security.
Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong Right to Governmental elections, demonstrators swear refusal
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided by the Hong Kong electorate to nominate candidates for elections in 2017, despite the increased call for democratic reforms.
This approach is likely to fire the long-known protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists have been able to plan and mobilise it within a few hours after the notice.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-peking faithful candidates.
"It's not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to Hong Kong's inhabitants.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-General Secretary of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Great Britain returned control over Hong Kong, Peking promised to let the inhabitants choose the Head of Government from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the Sunday decision as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct election right to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the run by a closely controlled nomination committee.
After a new clause, only candidates should be authorised "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective protests in Hong Kong took place for several years.
The occupy Central With Love and Peace, which has threatened organizers to shoot off the financial district if Beijing does not allow real general elections.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of occupy central adherents had gathered in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong within a few hours after the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make any further information in order to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organisers informed that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action that should only take place when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and on Sunday, security measures were intensified before the government building, including police forces and barricades.
The disturbances are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city.
The increase of people from the continent increases competition for products and services.
Besides, the fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to break under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the occupy-Central movement, as it threatened the business - the Hong Kong lifestyle.
"The protests of which they speak could cause great economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long they continue," said law expert Regine Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want to make any fears that Hong Kong excludes control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also reported recently about the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western forces.
This summer, activists organized an inofficial referendum to the election rights where 780 000 people participated - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the United States is now transferred to the universities where Freshmen appearances are offered with the private aircraft.
We are looking forward to responding to this demand and offering the first luxurious travel service of Great Britain to students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also claimed that the service had a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to climb their greed in a dangerous overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we are looking forward to ensuring that the students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One company speaker said that there are no new bookings yet, since the service had just been introduced, however, added that "studios would book the service in the next weeks".
The company also informed that, despite the study fees of 9000 pounds per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today are very different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in their expectations and claims - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
The National Student Union, however, criticized the service as a decline.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for High Education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who begin to study this month are exposed to a crisis of life-keeping costs, as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and scholarships do not take steps with the strongly increasing invoices for the simplest basis of life before they can even remember spending thousands of pounds for such a simple thing as arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize race question and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hends up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protest in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers from white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared to the replies of black women shortly after the shots of August 9th, personal essays with titles such as "Thinking to Ferguson of a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" were relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I don't think you find many people in feminism who are about white and speak privileges in such a high-quality way," she said.
People felt moved to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnized that they must express that.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University, Ferguson raised problems with black American women every day, but they are not regarded as "women themes" in the cultural area.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 Likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colored people are in their own country, the silence of ears is deepening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dictotomy between race and sex problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now connect to the topics of race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lined and the reasoning was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's choice law such as Susan B. Anthony analysed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the struggle for election law could only be successful for each group: women or black one.
"They made the decision to engage in the right of women's choice, and the right of choice for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When you remember such things, you will be aware with power why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the election right in 1920, it took another decade until white women organized themselves against the Lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group came up nearly 40 years after the original request for help from the pages of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, race discrimination - is a mirror of the time in which white feminists played "fangs" with the problems that black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to receive control?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who built their career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to anticonception funds are now trying to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans about racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the race that is clearly different in public surveys - will lead to changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism, in which racial and gender homes are addressed, some of their comments on the racial theme in America are surprising.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to her previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of police with the black community is not the only problem that is pushing into the front of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police took up nearly 63,000 unmarried minors at the south-west border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform will come back to the surface - this time as a female topic.
Andrea Mercado, co-president of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for reconsidering the topic as a major female topic, she only needs to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the majority of the work shows go to male immigrants, the women accompanying them are in a position in which they are prone to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a afterhall in the women's organizations," she said.
"Schwein-Haus" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate makers when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The free house has a bedroom, located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 £.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig that had beded his head on a sofa.
Real estate maker Connells said that the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The picture, however, was misleaded and was now removed," said one speaker of the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former congregation house as a "unique single family house with a bedroom."
Although the maker has removed the picture from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The sale of the house provided social media for interest when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city Harvey is home to a new millionary after Lotto Wins
A lottery player from Harvey is in this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues with a happy winner who gets almost $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday.
A newspaperskiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot for the second time in five years in the drawing of the first division, after 1 million dollars in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, has to report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit provides conversational matter in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated profits in the first division last month, a feasible conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, one player from Canning Vale was one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had achieved the Mega win of $7.5 million a few weeks before.
The winner's couple had played for twenty years and said that the winner allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionary from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only the Gladiators were deep in the Matsch on the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the leisure park.
But the attractiveness of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defended the rain showers and the autumn cold and made themselves enthusiastic by the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful race of presentations, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial battle force of the Gladiator School of Amor Mortis, which used every rainpause to demonstrate its robust fighting art, prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert representative and sent his men in each other into the ring to the heroic two struggle in various gladiator gates.
First, the "producers" were in the row with rectangle sign and short sword and legs on the left leg and armpiece on the right arm.
It followed the "Esedarii" with breast sign, short sword and wormflance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius" who was entering the "Secutor" with a cast net, trizack and dolch and hit the kids to the ground after a short fight.
Since the swords were metalically connected, the shields created and the wrists fled surrounded by the arena that a fear and anxiety could become about the health of the gladiators.
But on them, the impressive "Summa Rudis", the musculous arbitrator, had always a remarkable eye.
"We wanted to resurrect the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman Time experienceable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organiser "Friendskreis Romerkanal", the intention behind the spectacular.
After two years of preparation, a "Upidum Romanum" from the recreational park for a day was a Roman, a Roman city, as Vizeburgermeister Claus Wehage found in his greeting.
Finally, the Romans have brought not only war and conquest in our region but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we are admiring today.
The remainder was also amazed on the Roman Day, such as "Aquädukt-Marmor" from the 11 metres high and 1400 metres long Roman channel bridge, which was just at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once and now presented the water and energy supply, and manager Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of then."
This also confirms Diplom Measurement Engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "ingenieur team" of Rheinbach, who presented the Roman Measurements Instruments such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894, as well as stones from the original hypocouste, the warm air heating which once warmed the Roman villa.
Amazingly, the footprints that Wolf and Fuchs had left in the footsteps of sound two thousand years ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the Landdenkmalpflege Office at Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Business Park in Rheinbach.
A economic building has been found with a darr for drying cereals and for mealing.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural good, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of findings from these excavations presented it in a glass vitro, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a terrible necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the Germans invaded in the Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
With her, the children also occupied the Roman windmill game, similar to today’s mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax tables like the Roman students once wrote.
At the stand of the Roman thermal silver, the children were allowed to lay Mosaics themselves, to bastulate glass mosaics at the stand of the Rheinbach glass museum and to use a heavy wheat mill of stone at the stand of Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center to male the meal for a grinding bread or a mosli.
With the original Roman travel cars drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors travelled through the leisure park and passed by the impressive state of the urban gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Romans Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Watchberg will also be invited to the Roman Year 2014, which will remember the death of Emperor August 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations, and the Watchberger Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, a lecture, a cooking evening, and guides for school classes are offered and the Roman past of Wachtberg is remembered.
For example, a Roman Legioner is told of his work on the Watchberg, presented plants as living monuments from Roman times and offered a funny lesson in matters of international understanding between a group of Watchberger "Germanen" and attracted Romans.
Adendorf's primary school is dedicated to the Roman theme in a week of project.
With the Roman week, the numerous, but often no longer visible, traces of the Romans in Watchberg are to be resembled.
At the Watchberger Rathaus, a small presentation will remember the foundation of the Berkumer Matronenheiligdom in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemia Stresses West African Economy
The Ebola epidemic in Western Africa is also a serious struggle for the economy.
Markets are dismissed - and international companies go on distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic brings the West African economy a heavy hit.
The harvest is rotten on the fields, the mines are left and the markets are disappeared - the virus has been hardly added to the region.
Some international companies are already on a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic crisis," condemned the Head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital of Monrovia.
Only who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola is on the market.
Liberia has been the hardest hit by the virus, here alone, over 600 people were victims of the fever.
Recently, the health authorities explained that the disease was in any corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, over 1500 people died, thousands of others were dead.
Foreign companies deduct employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies are expelled.
Foreign companies such as the Arcelor Mittal Steel Group deduct their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers also respond: only a few purchasers leave their homes to obtain postponement.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things rot the important cocoa and coffee beans on the fields for export.
The farmers don't dare leave their home for the harvest.
Food gets scarce
"The people will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Pariser expert for the Western African economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables would prefer to stay at home.
The population therefore gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
In the markets, the stock drops from basic nutrients such as rice.
At the same time, the region strongly dependent on international companies threatens image damage - with profound consequences.
The greatest risk is that international companies are principally avoiding the area over a long time, says Philippe Hugon of French Think Tank Iris.
Decisively, how far and how long the virus will continue to spread.
In investors, the impression is that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and thus also to invest," Hugon warns.
The disease is also burdensome of the country's tightened government budgets
The disease is also burdensome of the state budgets of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets are strongly absorbed by the high expenditure on the health system and in addition by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are already apparent in Nigeria, where only a few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home because of fear of a infection.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly declined.
Shelters celebrate her 50th anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Berngau protective association celebrates his 50-year founding festival from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours at the Tannenwald Protective Association, the preparations for the 50-year founding festival from 12 to 14 September will take place.
It is planned on Friday 12 September, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday, the big ball shooting is at 18 a.m.
Afterwards, in the large festival of the mood evening with the "Stoppfälzer Spitzbaum".
Blacapelle provides music
Highlights on Sunday are the Festival Divine Service and 9.30 p.m. in the church and the great festival at 14 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the federal and Gaussian shooting.
A very beautiful view will be the 25 festive ladies with their dirdls.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The headquarters have taken over Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" comes from the year 1907, when the Association for Social Entertainment was founded on 21 March by exercise in room stuts and small caliber shoots.
The NS regime had led to the resolution of the association in 1937.
Only 1964, 19 young men found themselves again, who lifted the "new" protector association "Tannenwald" Berngau from baptism on April 30, Luke.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a protective champion through a difficult start time in which it was mainly about finding a club room and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the protector club started "Leininger" in the hosthouse with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports guards, who were now organized in seven teams, were established in all classes to the 1st Gauliga.
The association records purulated every year and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active protectors has increased, the numbers of members have also developed positively.
After the association site "Leininger" has no longer satisfactory to the demands of a modern protective association, then, under the leadership of Johann Rinn, has decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, priest Strasser issued the church blessing on 8 May 1988 for the new protective rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the association was certainly the 44th Gausser shooting, associated with the celebrity of the new protective flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the protective association celebrated its 30-year founding anniversary.
In 1995 a baller group was founded.
Joseph Schmalzl was a Böller-referent.
A major challenge for the "Ballers" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bayerian Baller Meeting in 2005.
In many hours of honor's work, the association members have modernized the rooms and shooting facilities in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought it to the latest update of technology.
Elf teams in round competition
The sports performances of the protective association can also be seen.
Totally, eleven teams are currently participating in round competitions: six air gunsmen, an air gun crew, a sports gun KK1, a youth and two AH people.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen in 2013/14 from Gauoberliga (highest liga in Schützengau ANB) to the districtsliga 1.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from Gauliga north to Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sports, events such as bocksticks, fashion and kingsball, club excursion and Christmas tradition.
The protectors are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race
Tony Stewart's return to the race line ended about halfway through his race on the Atlantic Motor Speedway.
Stewart went to the wall for the second time, after his right front strip was placed in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart took his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team manager Chad Johnston said that his 14-headed team was disappointed, but now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, the next weekend.
"I wish we had a better effort and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do it better there.
Stewart used to run on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to make the right side of his car repair.
"I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart let three NASCAR Sprint Cup races fall out after his car met another driver at a ashway race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace, during an investigation to the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., which had entered on the bike during a race to confront Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities informed that the investigations for the cause of the accident will last at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken on whether Stewart must expect a charge.
The three-time champion was received with great appreciation when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12 position, Stewart was shortly posted into the first 10 and was temporarily on place four.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs shot
Vehicle with no. 18 excluded control after the exit of curve 2 and collided with Stewart, both of which drove against the wall.
Stewart went on, but fell back to place 21.
Enjoying Dancing
Easy to try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Head Lisa Neitzel (from the left) look forward to fellow struggles.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in the TV are making Jahn the wholeday education at the further schools.
After summer holidays, some groups have decimered significantly.
Now there is a stronger search for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more actives, it would make it much more fun, "you could dance quite other choreographies," she says.
Anyone who wants to dance can jump in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, without obligation into the training hour between 17 and 18.30 a.m.
"The training starts regularly with a heating program," says the trainer.
Thereafter, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open for many styles.
Elements from Folklore from Classics to Sports and Acrobatics are processed in Jazz Dance.
Of course, the company is not too short.
"We're going to eat, watch dance movies, and we've even overnight in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own engineering development.
Whosoever isn't the jazz dance, he can insnap into one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and adolescents can always get into the education in the fields of child dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop into the lessons.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Who wants to see Discofox, Slow Walzer, Vienna Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, can see and participate.
Bulgarian prison overseers protest countrywide
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have organized a country-wide protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the recovery of their old working conditions, which have recently been modified.
Higher wages are also on a list of claims to be discussed with the Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
For one month the officials have protested symbolically against the new working hours and demand a return to the previous 24-hour layers.
Despite the meeting between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations will continue, the Director-General for the implementation of criminal measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, notified the BNR.
The protest of prisoners is expected to be supported by members of the trade union association of the staff of the Ministry of Interior.
Ukrainian Army surrendered Luhansk Airport
In Eastern Ukraine, the prorussian fighters continue to be on the premarch.
After severe fights, which were supposed to have been involved in Russian Panzerbataillone, the Ukrainian Army gave up today, Monday, the airport of Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army informed that seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeat of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the superior army leadership without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists shot aeroplanes off
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussian separatists have again shot a battle plane and two military helicopters after their own representation.
In addition, around 100 soldiers had been injured or killed in the Donezk region, according to Russian agencies reported the responsives on Monday.
Coast Guard ships lowered
In addition, the Resistants claimed to have reduced two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Asian Sea.
The Ukrainian border protection confirmed that two of his ships had been shot on Sunday near Mariupol Harbour City.
Seven border guards had been injured, a speaker in Kiev said to the transmitter 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
In addition, the separatists reported to have brought several localities in the Donezk area under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the Ukrainian Contact Group meets today.
In addition to the representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a missionary of the Separatists from Eastern Ukraine should also participate in it.
In the prerequisite, all players used their appearances to publicly announce their claim.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
The NATO will not break its agreement with Russia through the planned stationations in Eastern Europe due to the Ukrainian crisis.
On Monday in Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that the NATO is adhering to the 1997 NATO Council's founding agreement.
However, the NATO Chairman accused Russia of "one crushed fracture" of the agreement.
"Today we have to see the reality that Russia does not view the NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
Documents and comments from the Russian side show that they regard us as opponents.
Increased NATO presence
Rasmussen also announced that they would like to strengthen the NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to decide at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas conversations
Russia and Ukraine have officially agreed on new discussions on the settlement of their gas disputes.
The negotiations were set for the next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for a European Union decision to send a representative to the discussions.
Due to the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has no more fuel from Russia for weeks.
Lastly, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt the gas supply for Europe.
Europe refers to about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, of which a large part flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks Powerword: Maut will "come quite clear"
Now, the mayor is admitted to this again.
But it is not a free letter for all complicated details.
The CDU's hardnicked concerns against the truck-maid have inclined the CSU.
According to persistent resistance from her CDU, Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel has spoken a powerword for the introduction of a truck wall.
"To make it clear, she is in the coalition contract, and she will come," said the Head of the Party on Monday after meetings of the CDU headquarters in Berlin.
At a detailed model, Merkel did not find himself in the first place.
In the black-red government programme, "specified parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Traffic Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) made "a proposal, and it is now being continued to work on it".
However, the NRW CDU persists on its no to a wall right on all streets.
Merkel stressed that also Minister for Finance Wolfgang Schueble (CDU) constructively enters into the discussions for a draft law.
In addition to the subject, he talked with Dobrindt about further possibilities to activate more private capital for infrastructure investments, such as broadband expansion.
"There is nothing special about it." Schueble had left a "speaking" report uncommented on Sunday, checking his house a own concept to compensate for motorway investors with wall revenue - after the election 2017.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer warned that he would not develop Maut concepts against the federal minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never assumed to embark on all circuit and federal roads," said the North Rhine-West-Falish CDU-Landes Chairman.
This is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk again about the issue.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU Landing Associations Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
Background is fear that a wall affects small border transport to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded a series of CDU coalitionstreue because of the wall criticism.
The left views the plans in view of the dispute in the Union as failed.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said party manager Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The Wall fails the Minister." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German streets to start in 2016.
Inland automobile owners may not be additionally charged according to the coalition contract.
Therefore, they are to receive a full compensation for the wall through the KFZ tax.
However, the model may not disadvantage foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One British says she thought as a result of a failure diagnosis for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that harm the nerves outside of the brain and the backmark.
Charity CMT UK announced that failure diagnostics are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motoric disturbances such as muscle weakness, uncertain walks and crowned teeth.
Diseases also suffer from feelings of deafness or pain. The disease is unhealable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse with time.
When Rodger was 13, she believed that she suffered from Friedrich-Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 years old and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who are 51 years old today said, "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell constantly, and everything took longer.
I was never able to drive Rollshoe or Skateboard with the other kids and I was often struck in school because of my kind of walking.
Rodgers said that when she was 13 years old, after several surgeries for the discharge of her axles and stretching her feet, she saw her illness acts when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and paniced.
I thought I'd be in the wheelchair at 18 and die with 25, and then slowly all my skills would lose.
I made all this alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said, when she became 17, she realized that her skills had not declined as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and embraced me and said, "My love, I don't think you have it, or you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, their CMT was detected.
"When he explained what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT Awareness month to make attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether works as fireworker since the closing of the former troop exercise site
For nearly ten years, the former troop exercise site in Munsingen has no longer been shot.
Yet, every month, murdering ammunition appears in the heartpiece of the Biosphere area Swabian Alb.
Sometimes the granates are still so dangerous that they need to be blowed on the spot.
A ear-devastating knall runs over the heartpiece of the biosphere area at the explosions.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the Münsingen troop exercise site, which was closed after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares large area is the core piece of the Biosphere area Swabian Alb, which is open on 13 roads for hikers and bicyclers.
Taxation of businessmen in Washington's room increases with economic recovery
Recreation of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax statements for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, such as a newly published study last week, and the companies in the room of Washington were no exception.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia collected $27.6 billion to government and local posts in the financial year 2013, an increase by 3.8 percent compared to 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 per cent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year before, and it was the third year of growth in a row following the several years of decreasing decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues of the district, 56 per cent, come from business taxes, while 36 per cent of Marylands revenues come from companies.
Virginia achieves by 28 percent the lowest tax revenue from companies.
Most of the increase in tax revenues is justified by a recovery of the real estate values of companies, the researchers say that a 3.7 per cent increase in real estate taxes this year after the three consecutive years with a growth rate of less than 1 per cent.
While a large part of these gains came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the departure seems to be true for Washington.
Businesses in the district, Maryland and Virginia paid over $10 billion in government and local real estate taxes in the past year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in $4.2 per cent over a year.
However, the apparent recovery of real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as the real estate taxes amount to almost a fifth of the tax statements of companies.
Enterprises in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organisations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Director of the Centre on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to provide the same services offered by other countries.
The recent recovery of tax revenue by companies can not only be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market
The data appear to be recovered by company revenue.
Enterprises in the region reported income taxes in government organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.3 billion in 2012.
Maryland took up $1 billion in income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The increase rate in the district corresponded to 4.3% of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported a lower average tax revenue of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia, with 6 percent in all three fields of office, has the significantly lowest income tax on enterprises (in all three there are fixed tax rates on enterprises).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and the district is relatively high 9.975 per cent.
A comparable study of the US trade chamber at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia there are lower government and local business taxes demanded and overall a better tax climate than in Maryland.
In the study, the district was not studied.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure through his southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its company tax rates from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent this year, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 per cent in the next year.
If the State continues to reach its income targets next year, this law could reduce the State’s income tax rate to 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime, small enterprises in Washington seem to go better, and therefore they pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businesses - a transitional structure where most small enterprises are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster growth rate than the total company taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue this year, with an increase in the general VAT revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the area of Washington could be behind if the reduction of expenditure of the Federal Government affects the labour market in the region.
Partnerstadt: German beer for Guangzhou
Hop and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct direct flight between the two cities.
Deutsches Bier, broken in Frankfurt’s Partnerstadt Guangzhou - so is the urgency of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the vice-parties secretary of the South Chinese metropole, Li Yiwei, this week visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the discussion, the official of China's governing Communist Party came back to this issue of the Twelve-Millions-Metropole.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities of China, wasb Li.
Thus, people also have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD Chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gumbel, who led the German Political Delegation, told the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, cereals and pleasure," he added to the lunch with the party superior in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already shines Mr. Li, he flirted to the host.
After that, Guangzhou's functioner attacked with a shepherd gum - but with red wine served for the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German bride art.
Tsingtao-Bier is broken according to the German purity command.
More trade
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Parteichef Li.
The Airhansa had offered the flight earlier but deleted in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would reward again," the local politician proved convinced.
"The trade between our two cities continues to increase."
At the moment, travelers would have to take the route over Changsha in the province of Hunan, complained Li.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
Chen Yunxian, Vice-Guver of the Province, raised this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied shepherd-Gumbel - the Chinese Vice-President Li Jinjun, an intimate scholar of Germany, nicked.
Maintenanced partnership
Guangzhou's vice-participant hopes that he will be able to attend Frankfurt next year to a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to office this year only after his predecessor had been transported from the office for corruption claims.
The local party manager Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the Guangzhou employees is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is undertaken by Head of State Xi Jinping with hardship.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is very unusual in China's Communist Party.
Before he arrived in Guangzhou, he worked as a top functioner in Fujian, where the autobuilder VW builds a large work.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometers away Guangzhou belongs to those maintained by both sides, such as with a student exchange.
Last year the 25-year existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropole on the pearl flow is almost as strong as the whole Hessen with its economic power.
In the next year, she wanted to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reported Li.
Family of Joan Rivers "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious three days ago in a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has shown hopefully today that the 81-year-old comic is recovering from her disease.
"Thank you for your persistent love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a communication.
We're all pressing the thumbs.
According to her mother's sources, on Thursday after an emergency due to heart restoration, she was introduced to the Mount Sinai Hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors will deliberately hold them sedated and under precise observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "earst".
The reactions came from many sites, including in the form of an overwhelming online support by Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that come into trade from now on, more stringent environmental standards will apply in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer can identify central data, such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, in the pollutant class "Euro 6" sharper nitrogen oxides are applied.
In addition, there are more money for the constructioners: they receive a federally unified minimum wage of €10.25.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US-$).
The announcement comes surprising, not because no one had expected an overtake of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to the Google video service for a cool billion thing decided, and cooperation appeared naturally.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it became quickly a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", so an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better knowers give the (most older) games a strike of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just so that YouTube is often called, if you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy was taken somewhat boring, an example of a learning book of a established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a puzzle why the deal with YouTube was not done, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get faster there."
Another secret, honestly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they're rather sporting than watching, it's hard to understand the attraction that's going to look at others while playing instead of taking the control console in hand.
It is one thing to look at a friend over her shoulder at 3 p.m., whilst she is slinging by Resident Evil, and something quite different to see a spinner at the time of his shot 20 times in Call of Duty in his head.
All these games could you look at right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so viewing without its own control of the perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I confess that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our Electronic Age complete games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as a game or humorvirtuosis is not present, his Twitch channel is probably not very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It is difficult to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video, as YouTube Twitch could simply have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are being killed as advertisers.
As the Chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "be both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of a shrinking, not even - slick - as a spectator sport.
On the hopburg at the Burggarten Festival, some of the things were done on the Sunday.
The concept of the organisers voted.
Despite the strong rainstorm on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 musical fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
Timely, the inlet had to be stopped.
"That was angry," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt sweater in light and fun.
From two Spanish words Maxim Sakraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedel Burggarten is supposed to radiate brightness on the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This appeared on the early Sunday when the first visitors opened to the open air.
The organizers promised a festival for all generations.
And they succeeded.
It had made saltzwedels comfortable, but also guests from the nearest and further surroundings.
They followed the first live appearances, whipped with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation pure and enjoyment were caught.
And that cross through the generations.
While one of the white sands on the decks on the extra carved on the beach bar, others laughed on a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the emergencies on the hopburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when children were swallowed, the volunteers had to do all their hands in the truest sense of the word to become the Andrang master and to clean up imaginative creatures in the small faces.
The largers used the cherries or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot-Crew from Saltzwedel was arranged for.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 a.m., he shocked down on the visitors, especially families searched for the width and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not interrupt this.
"There came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
That is why the great party will not be repeated in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked, Sem made clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday to the people's voice.
As annoying, he said that the inlet had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently, the security company had been booked with too few powers.
As a result, some who had already paid did not come to the ground anymore.
The resonance had been very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who tumbled in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel Hip-hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox degraded its appearance.
The technicians were not able to create a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be constructed because the tents were not able to be brought to Salzzwedel because of a tyre pane.
"They will be there next year," said the organiser.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful by the visitors' numbers.
And that at bad weather.
However, the organisers have made some mistakes that will still be carried out at the first time, but must be removed at the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organisers have to criticize.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event side.
"You've taken you a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems very closely.
I think it is very good that some do not just cry stupid but also really try to put something on their legs.
Hate off!" writes Stephanie Jenß to the amula.
Now the organisers remain for a year to settle these criticism points.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchberg's marks shrink
It is not expected to be that way.
Instead, the constituent is ready to be used in the marked building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the TIRA space observation radar has been established, the shelf, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be a little smaller with a diameter of 47,5 meters than the old one.
However, the size remains the world record.
The last step to complete the new shelf is the shelf exchange
The upper quarter of the old shelf is separated and taken with a crane.
Afterwards, the last quarter of the new shelf is set up.
If the weather plays, the action should go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket Challenge fucks herself
Isabelle Roberts from Britain cried so much when her ice-called water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket-Challenge went painfully beyond.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she had cried so much at the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she ran out the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain circulated so much as her ice-called water was poured over her head that she hurt her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaw was just standing," she said to the Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't go, the jaw was heaped, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and my sister also saw this, and I almost made a laughter in my pants, but I had to get into the emergency.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was sent to the hospital in order to allow the bowl to recruit after participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to a Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castle associations going to get back to a string?
The two Wolfratshauser Burgenvereins were last again and again disfellowshipped.
Now, the boards think about possible cooperation.
As an example of the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the dead Richard Dimbath, former president of Wolfratshauser Burgfriende, led the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the castle club and the Wolfratshausen.
So far, the views of the history of Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed different.
Now the two camps move to each other: discussions about a common approach are to be conducted soon.
This confirms the associations Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we be able to put together once," reports Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both associations could be able to turn back to one point in the future.
Thus, there are faster visible successes.
While the castle friends around the sudden died Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest in the eye, for the castle club around Sjöberg, the "development and experience" of the terrain is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second Chairman of the Castle Friends, was very pleased with his own information on the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in front of the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a member meeting in mid-September.
At the moment, the association, according to the 74-year-old, counts around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have first made the association activities rest out of respect." This "thinking phase" had been needed to "thinking how it could go on."
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go to the conversation with the castle club.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a current picture of mood within their grouping.
A candidate for the presidency is currently not present, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself." He's not wanting to admit himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wants to work on the project "but he likes to continue working".
The different views of reconstruction in matters will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the next time.
He appreciates Dimbath as a missionary who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Through a high participation of the population and by voluntary helpers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But in the course of the time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to advance the project. It could be created a "almost option" for the river town.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitors tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of reconstruction I personally do not want to simply throw over board." He hopes that the castle association may move something in this point.
Their aim is to document history first, "is important and good".
Then you could continue to see.
Clever ways to save in Uni-Learning Books
Since the cost of university learning books for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast-second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a smart sparcade.
He found a loan system for books of students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick file A-cake," said Schroeder, 19 who visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college director announced that the student in average spends more than $1,200 per year for teaching books and study material, however, there are various cost-dempting options for the students.
Online leather and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for the students.
The rent of teaching books becomes more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when they buy.
Neebo Inc, who operates more than 250 university book stores, announced that the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books had been rented in the college books during the last spring semester, said Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased in campus books according to the trade association National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-time for the best deals.
Buy Online
Some new books are costing only one third of the price for which they are available in the campus book store.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be paid for the specialized teacher Chegg.com for $239,99.
Buy Used
If one does not matter the notes of other or normal use tracks, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate at the Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was newly sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors if previous expenditure are allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for seminar work.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the most recent expenditure costs.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting learning books is worth considering if you treat them somehow well, think of returning them and you do not want to keep the books after the course has ended.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the provisions of the business where you rent, including the penalty fees that may be applied for writing notes, subscriptions or use traces.
Careful: If you don't return the book, the punishment fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books are also an option rather than conventional teaching books.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesale dealers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, since many classics today can be downloaded free of charge, while scientific and engineering teaching books can be very expensive.
Look at all.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the pricing of books, as you can be so sure to find the right learning book.
And before a online order you should check, so Gault, if the book is actually proper.
This lesson he learned on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the college book store.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a boxer
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only recorded $12 million of his budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" that was cut to Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million at the end of the opening week, while children's films, such as "drawn tooths made easy 2" also disappoint in income.
An article from the Telegraph critic Robbie Collin indicates that in children's films the lack of quality may be the reason for the films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" to date for children's films and described "Drachenzähne leicht gemacht2" as pure "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, in films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average cinema score and metacritic rating for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and the current year to at least 2000 line walls.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinema seekers and critics and suggest that this year's cinema hits are equivalent to those of the last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing sight habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Regisseur Jon Favreau, who is working on Disney's shortly appearing jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times change."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, netflix has in recent times achieved sales with streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they focused too much on comics films and prophesied a "core melting" Hollywoods.
In the light of the current dismantling, some commentators argue that its dark prophecy can contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cashslagers expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the fall of the cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
A few years ago, when the second table tennis district class was deleted for the purpose of penalising the League division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the Deutsche Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Federal League into the programme.
The result: whoever hasn't risen has declined.
Thus, Göttingen's highest team of Torpedo in the Oberliga-Relegation has avoided the decline, but only five-class in the coming season.
Fourth-class torpedo ladies stay in the Regional Liga despite their grandiose doormarch.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony, as well as the boys of the SC weeping.
The SG Lenglers and the Torpedo Reserve join in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landliga, there are no goddess clubs represented anymore.
With the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo district in the Landesliga.
What from the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district soberliga South.
Here, TSV Seulingen, VfB Lødingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Oberder SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC.
In the districtsliga, as a regional representative, Dransfeld and the SC call, in the district class of TTC II, Red-White, the Upper SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The District Soberliga of Women begins at least in sound strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
In the district lig starts Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen.
With nine teams
The SC weeping sends his girls to the small district.
Also, the district liga stack of the SCW kids - there still starts torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weing and the Upper SV go to the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger circulars start with nine teams each.
In the West Stoffel, the Red White II, Upper SV III, Laubeach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Milenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East Stoffel, there are sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Queen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemels, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weing and the SG Rhome.
This is still better than the Easterode circle, where there are no women's teams at all.
Attention that none of the six second classes will reach sound strength, here the innovative and overdriven circuit board will have to think once.
NATO Summit: First protest in Newport and Cardiff
In the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds in the centre of Newport gathered into an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the city hall in order to hold a so - called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments in the weekend and spoke with demonstrators traveling from Bridged to Belgium.
Teenagers Flowed Out from the Blue Mountains
TWEE youthly bushanders were put in security with the seil winds after they were caught over the night into the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govetts leap in Blackheath.
Anxiety relatives called the police at about 20 a.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke up and the pair was found near Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23 p.m.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had crashed and had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were fled out on Monday tomorrow.
They were delivered in a stable condition with a nursing car to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalating government enemy protests in Pakistan
The about 1000 demonstrations were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister for Information Pervaiz Rashid.
After a half hour, the transmitter resumed the radiation.
PTV Director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrants equipped with bars had damaged devices in the editorial.
Dead or injured were not reported.
The demonstrations demand the withdrawal of the Head of Government to which they propose election fraud.
The police announced that about one kilometre from the residency of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had come back to conflicts of about 3,000 demonstrants with security forces on Monday.
A cop was injured, according to hospital information.
In the weekend, at least three people had been killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrants tried to move to Sharif's residence.
They require the departure of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military had called on a political solution of the conflict to "suspend without time and use without violence".
The Communication further said: "The Army remains obliged to ensure the security of the State."
The escalating violence has caused concerns about military intervention, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests referred to by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have persisted since the day of independence on August 14.
Sharif rejects a withdrawal.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without forced Sharif to return," said Khan.
Qadri said similarly.
Khan insists Sharif to have won the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the withdrawal of central and province governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government district.
The demonstrations had first persisted peacefully before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to enter Sharif's residence in the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after second season victory on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 about crop, Rapid took a bitter week on Sunday a reconciliating end.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate depth with the out in the Europe League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and Torschützen Steffen Hofmann, who stood on three places with green white.
Schrammel dreamtor brings Rapid to the victory road Rapid showed the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki at the second season and goes with a success experience into the country game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Foreign Defence Thomas Schrammel, who, with his glorious leadership-volley from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute, put the soft ones on the victory.
"I thought I had all the frustration of Thursday and shed it under the latte," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel hit the last time in a Federal League Party on November 13, 2010, this was still for Ried.
The first championship meeting in the Rapid dress will therefore remain in a special memory.
"For me this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid afternoon," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term basin blessur, a scrap from the left to the right defensive side and also made his matter very good there.
He has enough experience that he can exercise this position incorrectly.
The gate he deserved, he already made some assistants," praised Barisic.
Team shows Character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 through Hofmann after a good hour that finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have registered.
"Thank God, we have had some happiness today," also noted Schrammel, who played on the breakdown of performance and results in the past few weeks: "The results have not voted, but the playlist was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games had been better than today" against "the strongest team that played in this season in this stadium".
Therefore, the first three points since July 26 have proved that the team's team has been intact in spite of the returnes to the defence: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
Not less happy for him: "That we have finally played to zero."
A lot of work during the country game break Also the condition that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger were complaining about several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl, and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-elfdebüts, make the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget this," reminded Barisic, who lost the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "which have been very stable in the past".
The country game break must therefore be used to "slick wounds and add a bit in the physical field," Barisic explained, who has five U21 selection actors in his series.
One that is especially located the break is Captain Hofmann.
He's breaking up for the crew, talking about pain.
Just in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic stated.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exchange in the 68th minute, not only the structure, but also the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who graduated his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 about the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We've probably also had a little happiness, but at some time the happiness must come back to us too.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He voluntarily urged to continue concentrated work: "You must not always see this black and white.
We have not played as bad in the past weeks as it has been represented.
But we can't believe that everything is good now.
The importance of his role for the team he could not defend.
It's a very young team that I can help very much at the moment.
They're at me in some phases," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to present himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counterpart "from the category of magic", as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been unfairly announced by arbitrator collegier.
The only claim I can make to the crew is that we were not in the direction of the gate in some phases concrete enough.
We had too little conclusions there.
Inside Defense Maximilian Karner saw it likewise: "It just started bad, but then we found clean and even made a gate.
Overall, more would have been in it.
Under this whip there is silence
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "My piece of Rhine Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these tree rices are still in the district, the pictured copy is the "sweeper" above the underweight brown.
A hollow walk leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It goes beyond groups, basalt stone pillars and Basalt stones.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, a mile north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it extends beyond the other trees of the area and reminds with an extent of more than eight meters of an American mammut tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bishopsheimer Archive extra and asked older people from underweight well to find out what ambitions it has with the giant rest.
The result of his research remained the right necessity for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the bovine shepherds should have driven their animals from underwear to the wheat that is hardly rooted and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the exhausted animal guards must have rested.
In the meantime, the area has gained its significance, because on the wheat, the bovine herds are actually reared.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has continued to find out.
However, when you enter the stone collections, you should be cautious, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for cruisers.
A hiking road leads from underweight brown to the tree, but something is hidden.
Further paths are depicted, the direction of high rain rises and invites to an extended hike.
Where is the Waterburg?
However, a waterburg, which is searched for at our next task, is more rare in the height.
The mirror in the grave already gives a good impression of the construction, but we have in the district some historic buildings to which the building conterfei could fit.
Where is our "Stuck of Rhine Happiness"?

After a week of diving, the Italian Prime Minister and the EU Chairman, Matteo Renzi, held strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit last week, the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as the head of EU foreign policy, she will be the successor of the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the governmental newspaper La Repubblica reproduces, the calling for its favourite Mogherini in the government team as a reinforcement of the position of the socialists and its own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to make the left base that is constantly seeking to rest against him, because Mogherini is assigned to this - even more moderately -.
Against the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland, nominated as President-in-Office of the Council, the dominant opinion in Rome is to make a political compensation.
Because at the same time the EU head diplomat becomes vice-president of the Commission President Juncker.
The EU Parliament's still outstanding agreement is considered to be safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year politician of the governing Democratic Party (PD) of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini, known for its ambition, has proved to be the "enormal challenges" for almost two decades.
The born Roman is married and has two daughters.
Their carriage began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which joined the Catholic Center Party Margherita in 2008 to today’s Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
With the choice of 2001 in the Left-Democratic Party Council, she entered the high-party policy, worked in the Foreign Policy Department, whose leader she soon became.
It occupied traditional Italian foreign policy priorities such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO intervention in Afghanistan, where Italy was involved with a troop quota, the contacts with the Socialists in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Members in which she is expert in defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If the PD today has a better relationship with strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the over 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU elections in May, then, as shown in PD crossings, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The comments in Brussels, the new EU external representative has too little diplomatic experience, thus lacking substance, are addressed in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherini's mistrustly realistic accents are persecuted for the crisis in Ukraine and are differentiated as a "Russian-friendly course".
It advocates the Pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through the Russian natural gas being transported directly to southern Europe, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi arrived as EU Chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for its first national visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the Shake hands were taken in Brussels, and they also invited the Creml headquarters for October to a mailing economic summit.
Totally nine young people started their training at Emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an Azubi, which has previously completed another training in the company.
The new employees are active in four training professions in the future: electronics (three trainers), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bookl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg Form Forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Free Careful and Sebastian Zahner from Pfrimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Tenz.
The new trainees previously visited primary or secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years as well as the trainers are going to a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day migration and rafting on the Inn is on the programme.
The company has a total of 435 and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep the mouth and bring France into order," said the most important alliance of Francois Hollande.
Mr Valls called on the deeply split left to show "your love" for the controversial socialist president whose cabinet conversion has been disappointed by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everybody's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay on his side," he said at a great applause.
As a provoking gesture, the Prime Minister stated that its government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite severe demands for a relief to the regulation of Emmanuel Macrons, the new economic minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his co-socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister for Justice, scattered sand into the gear in which she encountered a deceitful socialist parliamentary meeting and criticized the socialist party for taking the French "the faith in her future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculated the constant socialist grave fights and said that they couldn't imagine that the new Valls government would endure for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has neither, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will not also survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the call of her party after a resolution of the Parliament and said that she was confident at preferential elections as a winner and ready for the government.
France's governing party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March, and the judicial national front was in front of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of the French believe that the socialist party is exposed to the danger of breaking into several competing groups before the end of the term of office of Holland 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a policy scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve improvements in the economy and in record unemployment.
"There is a small window for possibilities, but the public opinion must feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of 3 billion $
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise driver in the world, says experts in the industry conduct advanced negotiations for the acquisition of the competitor Prestige Cruise International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its prosperous customership, while it is competitive with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the conversations could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also has a share of 20 percent in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company in Miami operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige cruises, also located in Miami, operate under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which share eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues of $1.2 billion for 2013, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is totally $29 billion, and in the next few years it is expected to be for it due to the strengthening of the middle class in threshold countries such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves for these new customers as the best choice in the cruise providers.
Prestige cruises applied for the exchange in January 2014 to the US Regulatory Authorities.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a recreational and casino group under the control of the Malaysian billionary Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went to the stock exchange in January 2013.
At the end of June, 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity company TPG Capital LP held a share of 8 percent in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together, according to the original application documents for the exchange of Prestige Cruises, more than 82 percent of Passenger Capacities at American Cruise ships.
Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China on the day after the election decision.
A peking-true group swing nearby the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress adopted on Sunday a framework law which only allows two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with peking faithful members.
This decision will make it almost impossible for oppositional democrats to be authorised to choose and led pro-democratic activists to observe their threat and to lamb Hong Kong's financial place with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's party leadership fears that the call for democracy extends to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Book, which presented China’s presidency over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an inofficial referendum to the election procedure in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the business district of the city and organized a sitting in it.
Lis interview is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Association Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice-President of the Office for Affairs of Hong Kong and Macao of the Council of State, Feng Wei, should be consulted during the day.
Student activists announced to gather in Hong Kong in the afternoon before the headquarters office.
United Kingdom did not provide any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands by Kiev the inclusion of 'static talks' with Eastern Ukraine
The Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government would fight against the separatists in the east of the country and take up direct negotiations on the "statity" of the deceased region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of Eastern Ukraine under the control of the Separatists will become part of Russia, but that its status towards Ukraine must be re-defined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiefer government on negotiations at an eyelight with the pro-Russian responsives, however, corresponds to the strategy that it has been pursued since the beginning of the excursions five months ago: helping the Separatists to take up areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossija to be independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the State TV Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recover the areas held by separateists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had announced the Ukrainian Peninsula Krim on 18 March.
The Kreml and the Separatists have recently called the absorbed area "Novorossija" or "New Russia", a term that reminds of the prerevolutionary glowing time of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, during the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for elections on October 26th and while government groups of civil communities in the areas held by separateists, hope to be "catched in their illusions", reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to start promptly detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of Southeastern Ukraine in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the government must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiefer leadership for months to disperse fears in Russian language areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Creml speaker for the correction of Putin's "Fellow Interpretation" comments underlined the leadership of Russia when dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct annexation of the Crime, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much greater difficulties in appointing the Donezk and Luhansk regions in Eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and surveys from the time before the conflict resulted in a wide majority for the rest of Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving Kreml de facto control over an area that combines the Russian state with the Crime.
The peninsula, which was annexed five months ago in the Black Sea, is the home port for the majority of the Russian marine as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostow area in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and guitars, which produce important components for the Russian military.
On 7 June, the Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should take account of additions to the Constitution, with which the respective regions are given greater control of their financial and language status.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast with those of the Creml and the separatist rebels whose armament and rebellion Moscow is being encountered.
Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the Separatist leaders at the height of the eyes followed after further rebels in the past week after Russian troops and pancers entered into Eastern Ukraine through the former peaceful region along the Asian Sea.
The Separatists supported by Russia took over in the hands, which, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officers, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Krim, the control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been underway to establish Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500 000 inhabitants, which is between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the island of Krim.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked for action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are standing just before a point where there is no more back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on any concrete actions, the leadership required the draft further sanctions against Russia, which were to enter into force in an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers ended last week in the Donezk region in order to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, including the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk, were probably exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian fallscreen hunters caught in Ukrainian territory a week ago, and Lysenko communicated on Sunday.
Naked Photoscandal around Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten didn't make a hole about his trouble over hacker, who probably stole naked pictures of his engaged Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who the A-promis from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking candal around Promis on the Internet.
The hacker responsible for this has probably 60 neck photos of Lawrence, stars of "the tribute of Panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
By the Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were supposed to have been published because of a iCloud slot.
The list contains 101 Promises.
The noblest who had engaged in Grecko last month said to Confidential: "It's absurd."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and transmitted to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reported on a news site that the hack was "injurious" and that the affected felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which it is located at the top without in a pool.
Palmers' film works include "Liebe is inviable" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
One representative Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It's a terrible injury to privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "Hacked pictures posting from a mobile phone is nothing other than the sale of hehlerware."
Purely legally, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radlers, joggers and hikers were present yesterday at the 8th wheels on the Great Feldberg and thus supported the association "Help for cancer-sick children".
The tour, for whom one was a torture, represented a slight training for the others.
In one, however, all agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For for the first time in his life, the chief of the Oberursel Brauhause was riding on the fieldberg by the wheel yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cat there, especially as his participation on the 8th wheels on the Great Feldberg in favour of the Association "Help for cancer-sick children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought a valuable knowledge.
That's a great thing.
"I know now that I can - well!"
Little pussy on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Upper Ursel City parliament, many of the 718 participants came to mountains yesterday in the early touch and came near the fatigue, but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier for others to overcome the 11 kilometres long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the circular day - red dress, red bike - made something on understatement at the start ("Every lot of professionals, there is the target!"), then it was half a professional at the mountain and went through the target after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the route in a routine, like Nina Kuhn, press speaker of the city of Oberursel, who had gone along with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathlets, the "Feldberg radels" was not necessarily a sports challenge: "This is Charity, we're happy with it - a trip we would have made anyway today," said Kuhn.
On their way, they had hit Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to beam back to the height.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swinged home at 9 a.m. in the saddle, "made" the fieldberg twice to then roll home with fun.
Funny also had "Frithen-Toni".
For the chief of the Oberursel Cultkiosks, cycling tours over the fieldberg are simply included.
He had squeezed 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilometer line.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says he's an "ambitioned racing wheeler".
He must be, too, because he was on his way with the Fixie wheel, which are also racing wheels, but without switching...
The fact that it went up, without a wheel, was not only the 20 hikers that rose up to the summit over the white wall and the fog stand, but also a jogger who pulled a trunk with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, provided security, said: "The one knows" I from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sleeve trail, only that he pulls the sleeve itself." So the man is kind of his own sleeve dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - had been sent in groups to the route in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30.
The first bike drivers and runners followed at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers loose.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Radeln on the Great Feldberg", gave the start commands and wanted the participants a nice trip.
For the next year he hopes that it will succeed in locking the route to the fieldberg up to the security of the participants.
