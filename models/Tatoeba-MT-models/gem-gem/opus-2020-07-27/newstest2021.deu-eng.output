A total of 174 harvesters were tested positively on Corona-Erreger Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, as the Dingolfing-Landau Landratsamt announced on Saturday evening.

This is similar to the SPD: "We have already demanded a special control programme for farmers with harvest helpers after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May," said Environmental Expert Florian von Brunn.
"The hygiene conditions at the workplace and living conditions must be monitored sharply from our point of view.
This is obviously not happening."
The outbreak had come with an insight.

Southly speaks of mass infection to Corona-Lage
Munich - Minister for Health Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a tea material for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be seen live on our website.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau County has scared authorities and politics.
At the large vegetable farm, nearly 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working, more than one third has been infected with the Corona vaccine.
The court is now under quarantine and is locked up with a building taun.

"Science bites": Confirmation of Nantes' condemnant firemaker
"My client has shown himself cooperative," said lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate is "pleased by conscience and is very embarrassed from the extent of destruction".
In the case of a condemn, the man threatens ten years of prison and a penalty of EUR 150.000, according to the prosecution.
The Gothic Sanct Peter and Paul cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged at a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in the church at three places far from each other.
Laboratory tests hardened the suspicion of firefire.
The suspicious now arrested had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diözese Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral in the evening before the fire.
Since there was no trace for a violent entrance into the church, he ran quickly into the field of the investigators.
Discuss about the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former president of the DFB, Reinhard Grindel, recommended to consider the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss, define conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said Grindel of the "Image on Sunday".
He emphasized: "For the associations that can become most dangerous for the best Bayers and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this regard, we do not come around the debate, whether it is not mandatory for associations who want to break into this plalanx to facilitate investor involvement."
He doubts, however, whether in the German Football Liga there is the willingness to allow majority participations that are prohibited by the 50+1 rule in the Federal League.
"It remains a legal risk to move investment zones into a European internal market to the economic location of Bundesliga," said Grindel.
The former DFB-Chef sees the risk that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Federal League at the end only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but no more tension in mastership."
Even a equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of EUR 750 million, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already immense among the first three associations alone.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"The leaders have been people who have noticed this error and passed through to the press instead of responding to me," said Grindel about the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his withdrawal in April 2019.
"It's been very busy in human beings."
The gift of about 11,000 euros he had received from an Ukrainian functionary.
"I have committed a compliance infringement, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"With the uminous watch gift, I have handled completely transparent and insane.
Many in the DFB knew of it."
He never made "a hole from the gift," insured the 58-year-old.
"That may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the entire opposite of corruption."

Argentina rejects the rejection of the creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires informed on Saturday.
"This would be not only irresponsible but also unfair," said one opinion.
"While 50 percent of children live in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our believers."
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer durable under the current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina urges its private creditors to refrain from a part of their claims of approximately 66 billion US dollars (approximately EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state pledge.
It would be the ninth payment failure in the Argentinian history.
Lastly, the creditors had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
However, the Argentinian Government holds its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was last more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decrease in economic power by about ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not compensated for interest claims of 503 million US dollars and thereby had been a limited payment loss.
Professional arrival - private not yet
"It's running super good" - this feature draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after their first days in the notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very quickly: In the middle of May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will enter the succession of Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden Notariat.
Six weeks later, early July, the promovated lawyer took up the work, the normal day business is running long on full tours.
"I still have to come to private," she explains in conversation with the Redtal advertiser and laughs.
Of course, the short past time has not been enough to transfer the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the borrowing Dingolfinger.
At present, she is with her husband who is in Regensburg as a judge at the Landgericht, looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city.
At least her husband has been able to apply for a short-term parental period to ensure the care of both daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to pendle from Regensburg every day, she sometimes also has an overnight opportunity with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Adults in the neighborhood, her city of Eggenfelden, of course, has long been a term.
When visiting on the site with her family in the past few months, she then recently found "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
The more she enjoyed that she made the race in the selection procedure around the free place.
Also, in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career, her home Niederbayern plays a central role: after the Jura Study in Passau, she carried out her referenda and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notarassessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallguu, and Regensburg - at this time she also trained "newbei" the promotion in labour law - she entered her first place in 2012 as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016 she went to parent, and eventually followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she took over representation services in various notariats.
The 39-year-old explains that when the post was appointed in Eggenfelden because of the nearest retirement of Lutz Feller, it saw the right time for the full recreation of work.
The team of her predecessor, who will take the vacation representation in the Notariat station, has taken Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and has just prepared a praise for the office team: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded operations here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming transfer of the private food point.
In matters of children's gardens, she has already contacted a local facility.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here soon - and to know the most beautiful jogging lines of the Red Valley.
BVB plans for league start with a maximum of 15,000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football city in Dortmund will not even be filled with 20 percent for the seasonal start in the event of a fan return.

The Cramer responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation by the BVB hopes that, in addition to the normal viewers' places, some of the about 4000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a stroke to the office when these revenues are completely disappeared."
In view of the persistent Corona crisis, all are at present "good advice to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies are not good and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need is limited to entertainment," explained Cramer.
The Dortmunder Marketing-Chef praised the BVB-Profis for their salary loss, which is intended to contribute to the overcoming of the crisis: "The players, of course, know that their salary loss has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in Merchancing on short work."

They are so small and so early born that neither lungs, nor intestine, nor muscles are fully trained.
Her skin is sometimes so delicate that they could hurt the electrodes of an EKG.
And they are so small that they sometimes wear puppy clothes and specially made for their mini winds.
But not so small that they weren't at voice - "and like," Berndt Humbles Urlesberger.
"Even if they don't cry as loud as big babies of course."

Teacher Teresa Nar rejoiced about the enrichment of the teaching.
Although, at the end, all the participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would still offer additional attractions, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in schools.

The film studio Warner Brothers took her for seven years under contract and brought her out on the side of Eroll Flynn.
Eight movies turned her with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the main role of "To Every His Own".
The film was in Germany under the title "Mother Heart".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wylers "The Heiress" (The Erbin).
A lot of recognition was also given to her as a neurotic excentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Slanggrube".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her for the main role in filming her novel "My cousin Rachel" in 1952.
The piece became a global success.
With her long-year-old friend Bette Davis, she played in "wogen song for a body".
From the marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son Benjamin evolved.
In Paris, de Havilland married the journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.

Kalbitz kick-out from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Figblad"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig sheet" in view of the FDP and does not change anything about the nature of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the legal extremes in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the Iceberg of Radicals in the AfD," said FDP Policor Benjamin Strasser of the News Agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday, the Bundesscheidsgericht der AfD in Stuttgart confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which was decided by the Federal Board in May by the majority.
Kalbitz is Chairman of the AfD Group in Brandenburg's Country Day.
"If the AfD really was about to remove legal extremists consistently from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and his followers were long been excluded," said Strasser.
"It is not a political will in the AfD, however, because legal extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "This Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, says nothing and does not change anything," he said the "World on Sunday".
"Instead, it speaks bands, how many frenetic supporters still have a legal extremer in the middle of the AfD."
Flower assumes that the AfD will return to less than five percent in the future in elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the speakers of the officially dissolved "Flügels" around the Thüringer AfD-Landes- and Group Chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection inspires the beauty as a "safe right-extremistic effort".
In May, the President of the AfD had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, Kalbitz did not specify a former membership in the now forbidden legal extreme "Homely German Youth" (HDJ) and in the Republicans.
Kalbitz contests the membership in the HDJ.
Also, the chairman of the left fraction at the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the decision of the Bundesscheidsgericht does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten creide.
The AfD remains a right-extreme party, whether with or without calbitz."
With this decision, neither the federal party nor the right wings are weakened.
"The manöver of the meuthen troop is transparent.
You want to avoid another observation through the constitutional protection and try to get through the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD will not lose the spirits she called.
There is no change in a outcast," the Brandenburger SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn commented on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD-Landes Association and the Group held to their right leader until today."
The legal dispute about the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
This announced on Saturday that he would now act against the decision of the Bundesscheidsgericht.
North Sea Wine Parks deliver well 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants at the German North Sea have eaten 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the network.
This is about 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator informed Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for transmitting the North Sea AC to the Festival and transmission through the German electricity network.
The wind plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have eaten another 2,22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind flow from the North and East Sea will be 13.73 TWh, compared to well 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Thus, the wind harvest at sea accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany, which is about four percent points more than one year ago.
New windparks provide higher production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy comes from higher production capacity in addition to the wind conditions, because in the last 12 months new wind parks have gone to the network.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea all run with full power, they could generate computing 6.7 Gigawatt electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; it is according to tennet at 7.1 Gigawatt.
By 2030 it is intended to rise to 17 Gigawatt in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network bonds," said Tennet business leader Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can also not use their capacity on sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is the 2rd January when the North Sea Wind Parks produced more than six Gigawatt electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 Gigawatt electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition of the Leipziger Artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.

Freital: Windberg Festival cancelled for Corona
The Windberg Festival does not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day celebration planned in September.
In other years, over 30 000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - in the consciousness of how difficult it is economically for the participants - hoped until the last minute," said Oberburgermeister Uwe Rumberg (parteilos).
"But at last we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here as an organizer."
Because if tens of thousands were flown into the mainland and the capital, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact follow-up could not be complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that a national festival would not have left much.
In addition, organisational and monitoring efforts would increase unreasonably by a multiply.
Rumberg comforted next year.
Then the city Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence, among other things with the winter mountain festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.

Recently more flights in worms
Wormser University continues in the ventilation: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" establishes a professor for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS was now signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
The professor has the opportunity to allow the start of the study not only in the summer but also for the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, both in the university and at the DFS Air Safety Academy, the capacity is equally exhausted.
The DFS will consult the university in the establishment and occupation of the professor.
Since 2019, represented at the university
Since summer semester 2019, the first students in their training for flight lots at Worms University are at the Air Traffic Management course.
This year, nine students started.
Until now, the experiences of DFS are very positive, the performances of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lotsen training contributes significantly to further strengthening the attractiveness of the Lotsen profession.
"In these times, we are not economically easy to promote.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow on a long-term basis.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS in signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professor is a future-safe investment that will provide a wide, technically cross-border knowledge base for airlines in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and support our attractiveness as employer at the same time."
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms: "The Foundation Professor is an important bridge between science and economy.
With it, we want to connect to the existing cooperation with the DFS German air navigation as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor course Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German air navigation is for the University of Worm's motivation and the obligation to further strengthen their learning and research skills in the future areas of air transport.
In the use of tomorrow's airlines, the university with the first foundation professor for a dual course of study can set very special highlights and innovative focusses for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary of the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasizes: "The University of Worms has a unique feature in Rheinland-Pfalz with its focus on air traffic.
The current signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."

Healing wants to examine other industries by meat industry
The Corona crisis rediscovered the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Legislative distortions are shortly before.
But are they right - and will it stay there?
Mr Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries according to the strict rules currently planned to deal with infringements in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective sector if necessary," said Heil der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Berlin.
Germany’s employer already warns against restricting contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at the Flesh Rhine Tönnies in North Rhine-Westfalen, the Federal Cabinet will decide a law of salvation on Wednesday.
Grand slaughterhouses shall no longer be allowed to use non-residents in the event of slaughter, destruction and meat processing.
This is intended to prohibit the use of contractual and loan workers there.
The employer President Ingo Kramer said: "Finger away from a general restriction of contracts and transfers of workers, if you do not want to defend the economy completely."
Work contracts, for example, are compulsory for wide areas of craft, construction and construction, the basis for their value creation in the customer.
"The mistakes of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to prohibit works contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are meaningful.
"If a industrial company has the responsibility of a craftsman to build a security facility, this is a very normal working contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and leases only in its industry to be constitutional.
It is not explainable why the portionation and packaging of cheese should apply to other labour laws than to worst in the future, says in an opinion on the legislative project, as reported in the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saterday).
Therefore, a ban would increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Many Eastern European employees from contracting companies worked in the industry after the results of an examination of the NRW Labour Protection Administration partly 16 hours a day.
Often they had no break.
Remuneration has been retained for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that for the meat industry a relatively sharp law had already entered into force in 2017.
However, by "triple constructions" these have been circumvented.
"Now needs to be basicly cleaned up".
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide in the Cabinet at the end of July, are also measures not only relating to the meat industry, such as higher test rates for the protection of labour or clear criteria for Community accommodation."
The present draft includes amendments to the law on the safeguarding of workers' rights in the meat industry and the labour protection law.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I wish we could make more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal protection, all possible, for example, animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the "Brandenburg current" RBB mission.
However, more staff offices are also needed for more controls.

Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a releasing gate of Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian mastership for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-fold world footballer made the total 36th Scudetto of the Association History perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genua.
Ronaldo met 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, who entered without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is not going to disappear two play days before the end of the season of series A.
The second table of Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met after a release variant with the last action.
An example of Miralem Pjanic, the 35-year-old from the border of the criminal area, was directed with a flat shoot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved on 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted.
This ensured the shiny but decisive success.
The foul feet shot on the latte in the 89th minute, only Ronaldo himself is likely to have echoed correctly with a view to the gate jigsaw rating.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the moment is changing very easy," explained Trainer Mauricio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinee Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual fatigue of his players is great, said the Juve-Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the mastership perfect.
At the end, the calm spring at the top of the table, Juve was the last to blame for the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri manship had only succeeded five victories.
It is questioned whether Ronaldo is still to become a port guard king.
For during the Portuguese superstar hit 31 gates until now, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the Lazio Rome table foured at Greece Verona has already 34 meetings on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title gain of the FC Bayern.
The record in Italy holds the present Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinian reached 36 gates for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the next track chance is the "old lady" of the Italian football.
Juventus stands in the eight-finale of the Champions League, however, on August 7th against Olympique Lyon has to make a 0:1-shinding place to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. Round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races
Stuttgart - All threatened punishments and judicial judgments, despite giving car drivers in countless illegal races on the bath-worttemberg streets, continue gas: last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative values for the years before, but the racings are increasingly working for the judicial authorities: in the state prosecutorships between Konstanz and Mannheim, 155 investigation procedures were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, a year later it was already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
In the races it was less organised events, as the interior Ministry's response to a request from the Landday SPD.
In most cases, the drivers were spontaneously attacked or they would have escaped from the police - even this is shown as an illegal race.
In particular, German men aged between 18 and 60 years of age were at tax.
113 Penalties - 15 times prison
Only in relatively few cases, the Rasers are caught and also asked for the cassette: According to the Ministry of Interior, 113 punishments have been imposed since 2018 and 15 punishments of freedom have been expressed.
However, there are no suggestions that the number of illegal car races actually increase.
Instead, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of the past years and showed more frequently, one ministerial speaker said.
Especially popular for Rasers, the motorway 8. Always brake car drivers out there to provide space and use the free route for a race.
Last August a dozen driver was found near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 in Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "Rennstrecke"
At the A81, the police record even more races than on any other federal motorway.
A tempolite is attempted to brake the races out on the particularly affected section between agging and geising.
The most high-price and busy sports and luxury carrosses often have Swiss signs because the drivers are avoiding racing to Germany because of the high penalties for fast driving and driving in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the Tempolimit should not reduce to a few routes: "With a general tempolimit of 130 hours kilometers, we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, transport experts from the SPD country-day fraction.
"The barrier threshold for Raser would be significantly higher if you weren't expected to be legal with 200 kilometres and more on the road."
Rivoir is less aware of information or image campaigns: "If anyone, in such a way, moves over all the rules and puts his own life on the game, but also the life of other transporters, is hardly reachable with reason."
ADAC calls for a stronger penetration of the police
On the other hand, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser does not get rid of the tempo limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Department of Transport and the Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and more harder checks on the routes concerned.
Not rarely, from the high touring force measurement, painful and follow-up seriousness: Since January 2019 and April 2020, three people died throughout the country at the races, of which two unpopular in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's Innenstadt and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men were supposed to have delivered a car race.
One of the vehicles came down from the road, stabbed against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old advisor died.
21 more people were injured in the races of the last two years.
However, there is no need for sharper penalties by Minister of Interior Thomas Strobl: "The lawyer's needs to act in order to harderly sanction illegal motor vehicles are not seen," says the paper of the Interior Ministry.

Numbers of work agency: 900 suspects of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Labour Agency (BA), according to its own statement, is investigating approximately 900 suspicions of abuse of short-working money.
"This is very little for more than 880,000 companies who have shown short work," said Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, a lot of companies had suddenly applied for short work, the BA had to respond quickly.
Normally, the test lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available in this hot phase.
The more precise we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure it's going to be a few more.
We are not naive there and we have a long breath."
Indications on abuse are often provided by the employees or trade unions concerned.
The BA analysis software is also used to identify misuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency cell in the autumn.
"Will there be much more insolvencies than in the previous year?
Assessments are divorced, but we are now taking care of the case and training our employees in the work agencies for the processing of applications for insolvency money."
The numbers are still unnoticed, said Terzenbach.

North Korea departs border city after Corona suspected
North Korea has hitherto seen a "lightening success" in its own measures to protect Corona virus.
Now the country reports for the first time about a suspicion.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely locked a large city out of fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the last six months, "the evil virus could have been swallowed into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency was put on.
The Communist leadership called out the highest level of alarm.
If the suspicion was confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the abandoned country.
North Korea has not yet registered a single infection and has described its defense measures as "liquid success".
The information was doubted abroad.
The disease symptoms were identified by a "eliminator" who illegally crossed the military demarkation line between South and North Korea on July 19th.
The person left to South Korea three years ago and was now returning over the border.
There was no confirmation from South Korea for cross-border areas within the four kilometres wide and largely still mined military buffer zones.
However, according to reports by the National News Agency Yonhap, the South Korean military awarded the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Some individuals were investigated.
According to its own information on Saturday, due to the suspicion, an urgent meeting of the Labour Party's Polite Office was held under the Chair of Powerholder Kim Jong Un.
The "hazardous situation in Caesong could cause a fatal and destructive disaster".
Kim has already ordered as a preventive measure on Friday, "to block Caesong completely and to isolate every district and the region from others," it continued.
The person concerned as well as all people in Caesong who had had contact with them had been placed under quarantine.
Consequently, the central military Commission of the party is to examine the "extinction" and the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, impose severe penalty.
It is estimated that about 300 000 people live in Caesong.
Excitement before the Council meeting: City East and Noise Protection are still for a great summer break to discuss
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the Board will also vote on the construction plan for the major project Interior Development-Oost," it is more adjacent in the middle of the urban press release to the next Municipal Council meeting on Tuesday 28 July, at 16.30 a.m. at the Great Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
However, especially the upgrading of the Eastern City will be discussed controversially until the end.
The majority of these are little, at last in individual committees even rejecting, depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), which was developed from the citizenship and then by the administration and the municipal board now not to fail to prepare after almost ten years of preparation, criticized Reinhard Klein project maker as "external parliamentary opposition", "entingless", "Specular", "suppression" and "conscious false statements".
"All believe to know it better," said Klein, who has belonged to the Municipal Council for a year as the only representative of the public list Pforzheim.
Actually, after lecture of the contracts in this position, he is: "I know what I'm talking about."
The excursion is cheaper, the technical council is against the statements of the city administration by grants of which the existence of small is convinced to sanify for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than it is forecasted in the Council Hall and on the part of the supporters from the economy.
To create the city by its own power and not by means of an investor: This is his plan B. One day after small, the FDP/FW/UB/LED fraction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
In general, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical Council, the opening of the castle, the rental of the ex-thal for administrative areas and a smaller interior transformation in ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a key role
In addition, particularly environmental issues will play a key role.
The municipal council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise burdens caused by road traffic, including frequently temporal reductions.
In a press release, the current transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. The political officers in the city are not innocent to the need to do so because they have contributed only to the massive increase in car traffic and thus to noise by neglecting line bus traffic with diluted tacts and by little involvement in bicycle traffic.
Similarly, the Municipal Council agrees on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, on the agenda of the accession to the Climate Pact of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the urban children's day facilities and the request for inclusion in the Federal Smart City Fund.
Citizens are welcome, but they must take care of Corona protection measures.
With a lot of delay Tim Zimmermann starts in the new season
With almost half a year's delay, Tim Zimmermann starts on July 31 in his premiere season at ADAC GT Masters.
Before the League of Supersport Cars can take up the regular operation, the first test drives were now on.
For Zimmermann it was mainly about to meet his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from attacking his first service trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old longenargener turned his first round on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are a few things that are different from porch from the presaison," says Zimmermann.
"For example, with the ABS you have to go differently into the curves.
But it really has been a lot of fun."
Roomman also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite its only 25 years, the Netherlands has been experienced in the GT sport and has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand blending and we also made huge progress at the Lausitzring from Session to Session."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From July 31, the 33 supersport cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of the 15 series nebulisers, knows the route.
He was last guest in the motodrome in 2015.
"It worked quickly and I had little to get used to the route," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many quick passages that you have to meet optimally to be fast."
How fast the roomman is then, that's how fast it's in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poker at the tests a little," he says.
"On the other hand, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the entrance of a thickly pressed calendar.
By the beginning of November, seven races are on.
Current stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In the mid-August at the Nürburgring, Ex-Formel-1-Pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take into the GT-Lenkrad.
British Carriage Minister of Quarantine Decision Cold Caught
The UK Government's decision to put Spain vacations under quarantine for two weeks after its return, has, according to press reports, caught the country's transport minister coldly.
Thus Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided the measure on Saturday.
Due to the rising Corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London declined the country from the list of countries from which no quarantine requirements could be entered.
The new regulation applies from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also need to return to quarantine.
In Austria, the government has also undertaken quarantine measures for returners.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the holiday date, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
In Austria, Spain is considered to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there is the possibility that a quarantine is attached for holidayers in Spain," said the Labour member Diane Abbot.
"But, obviously, no one has tried to tell Grant Shapp's message."
Nearly a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict starting blocks, the numbers of infections in the country rise again.
Virologists are particularly responsible for the recent spread of night life.
Spain belongs to the most favourite vacation countries of the British.
From unnecessary trips to the Spanish continent, the British Government is currently advised, the Canarians and Balearians particularly popular for British holidays are excluded.
More than 272,000 infections have been registered in Spain with the new corona virus and more than 28,000 dead.

Hurrikan "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help for Corona hard
Washington - The first Hurricane of this year's season over the Atlantic has been shot on land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and severe rainfall now threatened parts of the U.S. State, informed the National Hurricane Center of the US Climate Authority NOAA in the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott called out the emergency for many districts.
The Corona pandemia that grass in Texas harms the work of the helpers, Abbott continued according to US media.
Evakuated for caution
"Every Hurricane is a huge challenge," said Abbott, according to the "Houston Chronicle" newspaper.
In view of the turbulent storm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is worsened, when one considers that it is feathered by an area that is the strongest affected by Covid-19 region of the state."
According to Johns Hopkins University, some 5000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemic.
Abbott called up people who had to leave their houses for caution.
You should not neglect practices, "to which we have used", such as the wearing of masks, said the governor according to the CBS transmitter.
It's important that everyone stayed away.
Therefore, in some places hotel rooms were also provided.
In addition, it was to be tested at Corona in emergency accommodations.
First, damage had only been reported from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Sturm Warning Reverted
With wind speeds up to 150 kilometres per hour, "Hanna" was hit on the island of Padre Island directly before the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been raised to the orrican of the lowest level one.
For the coastal section of Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm-fluid warning was first issued and withdrawn later.
The authorities expected a weakening while "Hanna" continues to move into the inner country and to control the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurrikan "Douglas" was traveling to Hawaii on Sunday with wind speeds of about 150 kilometres per hour.
However, the Hurricane Centre expected it to continue to weaken.
According to the prediction, he is supposed to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the Hurricane shore.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected this year after a prediction of May an over-averagely active orrican season.
From June to the end of November, up to ten Hurricanes would be expected, of which up to six might become very strong turmoils, the Authority had explained.
On average, there are six orchards per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop to storms of great strength.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of normal season is only 30 percent, which is a lower average even at 10 percent, it was then said.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote by Twitter that his government carefully observes the storms and is in contact with the state concerned.
Four gates known: Video assistant "refused" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic was known as two gates
Naples - Four gates reached, four gates known: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven black evening at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football line A series - and was quite angry on the video assistant of the referee.

The VAR has never done so hard against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
The host Naples had gone in the 8th minute by a gate of Foreign Defence Elseid Hisaj, while the 32th minute Filip Djuricic first rejoiced the compensation.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) declined the meeting due to a defence position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball again into the network - again the VAR intervened.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard hurt
Munich (dpa) - The start in the hot preparing phase for the Champions League began for Double Sieger FC Bayern with a backslag.
After a short vacation and a few training days, the Hansi Flick has to think about how to rebuild his successful defense after the first team training after the injury of World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The franchise, who has the third-meister working minutes behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Central Field Chief Joshua Kimmich, suffered a band injury on the left footroot and threatens to lack in decisive king class dual.
In the Munich Schmuddelweather, the legal defense broke off a training game and was driven from the place with a golf card.
How long the unlimited tribal player has to pause in the battle for the title is open.
It is difficult to use the Eight-final backing game against the FC Chelsea on August 8, that the final tournament, which begins in Lisbon on 12 August, is likely to be difficult to hope for the 24-year-old tournament.
But the Bayers do not want to stop from the missile from training on Sunday.
Flick called in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wanted to see from his stars on the way in Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are intended to show his hungry title collector in the 28 days following ideally until the Kingsclass endgame on August 23.
"We have simply mastered the duty tasks with mastership and pokal.
Now it's about to create the special one," said Flick.
Until the coins can deal with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve, the eight-final light is at the FC Chelsea first.
After the 3:0 in the play before the Corona break, the Londonians in the domestic arena should not become the Bayern nightmare again as in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the doors for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and trust thinking with a good game," asked Flick.
On Friday, an agreement test is against Olympique Marseille.
With a long talk, Flick had sworn his stars after the double 13 days of vacation on one single August.
31 players welcomed him on the Seven Street, including the new players about noble shopping Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues in the place for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has inserted himself well like all the new ones," said Flick.
But instead of speaking about the new season, if Sané & Co. no longer can only train, Flick rather spoke about the current track project of the German series champion.
After days of single and small group training, we are now trained in team strength for the Londoners, in contrast to the Flick ensemble in the game rhythm.
Afterwards the coins could face a quarterly final against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finale Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
One way to the final in Lisbon "is not so easy," the chief coach stressed that from Tuesday on, he can trust the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training.
The WM recorder shooter Klose and Flick knows of so many common tournament preparations, which is especially relevant for the 0-to-100 vote.
With his current team, the work was "a pleasure," praised Flick.
The "Focussierity on Wins" is an impressive characteristic of his team.
At the tournament with nine-manships, it was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the performers were there, including the Migrant Thiago and Defence David Alaba, whose stay is not secured beyond the king's class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to cut their world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to forgive the WM title.
All American races were cancelled, however.
Racing calendar becomes more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current formula 1 season continues to take shape.
The Grand Prix, which has been confirmed to date, added three more race routes during the week.
In October, the Nürburgring in Germany and Portuguese Portimão is to be driven.
On November 1, Lewis Hamilton and Co. are fighting for WM points on the Italian traditional separation line in Imola.
The Rennkalender 2020 thus includes 13 runs according to the current status.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in the completion of our plans for the season 2020," said Formula 1- Boss Chase Carey.
Overall, in this extraordinary season, 15 to 18 races are to be completed in the kingly class of motor sports.
Formula 1 wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the races already officially planned in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports suggest that there could be still appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules require race on three continents
The regulation of Formula 1 requires for the award of the world championship at least races on three continents.
Although, as currently planned, only two continents are being driven, there is to be a world champion.
Using a special rule, the FIA wants to give the titles on "exceptional circumstances" because of the coronavirus pandemia.
The traditional seasonal start in Australia in March had to be canceled short-term due to the ongoing corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a topic.
In addition, the formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Discontinuation is criticized in Brazil
Due to the tense Corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil.
"We are looking forward to being with them again in the next season," explained Carey.
The cessation of the American races, especially in Brazil, criticized: "The cessation was not surprising for us, but the reasons we cannot accept," said Tamas Rohonii, Promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the numbers of infections in the São Paulo area are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not to want to drive to Brazil would also not justify a dismissal.
They are prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Evil view of Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in the well-known lateight show by Stephen Colbert, by a video shell, and she told her what she had in her head when she met Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was visited by video shell in a popular US lateight show.
She told us, among other things, about her fight against the mighty people of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad sight" at her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the last two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg was aware of her unreasonable use for the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known lateight show, she talked about her plans in the future and her meeting with the U.S. President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Letight-Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your mission and led a longer interview with the Swedish.
She talked not only about her fight against climate change but also about her conflict with the mighty people of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to control the focus from the climate crisis," she shocked.
"Everything from organised hate campaigns to threats, only because a group of children go on the road," she experienced.
Heads of State and leading politicians who spottled against them in social media or even trying to bring them to silence, she finds "love", as you show the reactions, "because they have no other answer to it".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she cast U.S. President Trump a bitter evil look afterwards.
At the UN Climate Summit of 2019 in New York, for which the activist sailed over the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip, a GIF, i.e. an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for trump recipients.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at this moment?
On the relatively open question by Stephen Colbert, she answered just shortly and dry: "To be honest, I think that does not require any further explanation."
With the violent answer, the experienced Satirist Colbert probably hadn't predicted and just lost a little laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?"-speaking of the principles of climate protection, she remained in memory of many at the climate conference.

Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a trail: after a rapid rise with Fleetwood Mac it went steep down and then slowly back up.
Now the Bluesrock gitarrist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73 years, family members informed on Saturday in an official opinion that another opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton appreciated Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the Fleetwood Mac band.
Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-term legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamed instrumental hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End of The Game", "In The Skies") was similar to a trailer.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest successes but then without him.
There should have been disputes, among other things, because Green wanted to spend all the winnings of the group for pleasant purposes.
He began to appear in wide clothes and with large cruisefix.
Also, psychic problems should have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
It followed a social decline.
The Bluesrock gitarrist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatrie.
During a large part of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the picture area.
He is supposed to live on the road at a time when the courtyard gardeners worked and spent for a time in an Israeli kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as a son of a Jewish worker family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
He has been enthusiastic in young years for US blue musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
When he was 11 years old, he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15 the teenager began to play professional guitar and five years later the chance was to stand on stage as a Lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Little later he was engaged in the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 with his Bluesbreaker colleague Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
In the winter of 1968/69, the song "Albatross" composed by Green described the first number 1 hit and catapulated it at the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not force the media room, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit."
By the end of the decade, Green in 1979 surprisingly succeeded with an inspired album of religious topics.
Fleetwood Mac swims on a success wave without it in a new formation.
Your album "Rumours" appeared in 1977 sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite various small solo results, Green did not get a bigger comeback until he restarted with a group of friends musicians in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returned to the earth.
Free of drugs, Green published some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band dissolved in 2004.
For music experts he was a blues legend - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists in the past decades.
