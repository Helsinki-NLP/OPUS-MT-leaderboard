Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A mistaken arrival where youths are to meet today.
A crop chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now buried.
Kleingärtners manage the first reason of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's nervous when maps are not up to date.
Everyone knows that who had to start up, because the car navi showed a green wheat instead of a circumvention road.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern atlas, an offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the government, are everything other than current - but just because of this, very excellence.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it will be clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a flick deck that you do not recognise as such.
In the large map, more detailed maps for cities and communities, known as original maps, were included.
According to information from the Bayerian Measurement Administration between 1810 and 1864, these came from the first Measurement of Bayern.
Your contractor: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bayern since spring 1800 during the second coalition war with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and ordered a topographic recording of Bayern - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally deducted with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: it were the neighbors today who created the idea of a surface-through Bayern card.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "topographic agency" - and thus the Bayerian Measurement Management.
The original postal sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and can be found on the site of the Bayerian National Library, like all others.
The comparison Earlier/Today is the most insignificant example of the capital of the country.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
One example of this is subsendment, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.
Sending was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, that is, in 1877, as a Munich city part.
Today, subsendment is located in the middle of the city.
In 1856, the houses of submissions focus on the Plinganser Street, which was first designated after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bayerian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where today the West Park is, you can see nothing as fields - at the first look: while zooming in, a smaller map appears with twenty lines and numbers: manually numbered passages from the so-called "recording" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels are not there any farmers there anymore - but clay farmers of the plant "land in the sun".
A large green area is drawn north of subsendment.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the October Festival, has actually been a wheat - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original page you read not only the street name "at Gastig" or from the height "On the ventilators" in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeld street, people were locked up with crazy ideas.
There, in 1858/59, the Munich Circle Errnanstalt "On the Auer Lüften" was created.
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard led by Godden the establishment - that psychiatrist, which is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chain of the so-called mistakes.
In addition, he has prohibited the staff from applying violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, who has been involved in an exhibition.
For 280 patients, space had been first, later expanded to 500 places.
Sometimes this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circuit in hair in 1905.
The isar-Amper-Clinic München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatries in Germany, has been located there since 2006.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people are now meeting in the Munich Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies.
Western is the football site of TSV Munich East, eastern homes from the 1980s.
In 2015, the "Casa Don Bosco" child house was built in an architectural way to the origin of the male institution, which had been destroyed in the second world war at bomb attacks.
In 1856, the Marienplatz was named "Haupt Platz", the buying street was called "Kopeninger Gasse".
A decisive change also brought the Second World War into the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the allies risen many holes into the city centre in December 1944.
A great stay until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval crop capel were once at the Marienhof, where the preparing work was carried out on April 5, 2017, and the spatenstick for the second S-Bahn stamp line.
The slider can be used to compare the old Munich card with the air image of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group published Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Coloring has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discrimination policy and racist attacks of the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls on afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention in travel by the State and to give extreme caution, since a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred in the whole state and are noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recently adopted law by Missouri which makes it more difficult for people to gain discrimination complaints, as well as the criminal persecution authorities of the State who are unreasonably targeting minorities, led the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP.
"You have infringements of citizens' rights that happen.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are hit or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency as we have not yet heard."
It is the first warning that the organization has issued for a State in the United States.
The group quoted events such as racist infringements against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more petrol during his journey by the state and was arrested by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also points to a recent report from Missouri's General Attorney's Office, which shows that black drivers are being stopped 75 percent more frequently than whites in the State.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people have to be ready to bring guarantees or let the relatives know they travel through the state."
In 2015, Missouri reported 100 hatred crimes, following the latest figures from the FBI's Hass Crime Report Programme, which graduate the state with regard to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to complain about a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws to oblige local criminal persecution authorities to arrest people because of immigration infringements, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiles.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have adopted the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidezaun project is elementary
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the next year.
The CDU Federal Day Members Peter White and Kordula Kovac have made a picture on site.
At the courtyard of the Swindemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights in his business, where he manages 55 hectares of wheat and 40 hectares of forests, 40 milk cows and as many young animals and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
The "swarm sulphur milk" is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, says Swindemann.
The holiday guests' table is only regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaun project "elementar important".
I can't profit in such stable areas.
The greenland area provides a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the engine sensation.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," pointed Wendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he did not conduct a biooperative operation.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the Leader funding."
For costs of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare, farmers should be supported.
It is hoped that this would allow the forestry of the areas to be pulled out for a long time.
"The biggest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their business," the mayor stressed.
Agriculture is often in criticism because of support
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were collected on the promotion of weeds.
The opening surface is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be formed until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of EUR 71 500, half was funded over Leader, one quarter had the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained EUR 12 610, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of weed.
"The great advantage is the long-life of the teeth," explained Swingmann.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers."
Peter White also said: "There are best foods produced here."
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the State to promote weeds.
The goal is the openkeeping of the Black Forest.
The prerequisite is the existence of a funding set out in the LPR.
In addition, the area incurring must not be trailable (changing more than 35 per cent) and must be threatened by forestry.
For the Fischerbach Weidezaun project 2018, eight participants with 24 parcels are currently looking for building nearly 16 kilometers of Zaun.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully focused Sturz Saddam Hussein on the Firdos place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axis in a hot dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President to drasticly restrict legal immigration to the statue of freedom.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitations would've led him if he had.
But he attacked their significance, and especially the significance that was attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.
When Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom."
Miller is really right, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance on the upholsterous words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your arms, / your troubled masses that desire to breathe freely, / the evil waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time in which the "every waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people were not welcome to Trumps USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who used to place their words on the basis after their death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing female embodiment of freedom in a classical image used.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a different name: Mother of Exiles.
The connection of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people wanted to change this back from the right wings for a long time.
The big shrewhale Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the arrival of Trump, argued in 2010 that the statue of freedom is rather a early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.
It is intended to bear the flax of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.
The fake is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States."
Very unusual, Limbaugh has hit something here.
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the perception position.
The great fantasy act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted, evil but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is truely about seeing the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear.
And of course, that is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their fake shall not light the way, but inflamme the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black commends Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two shots belonged to the team of Britain
Neil Black, United Kingdom’s Executive Director of Light Athletics, says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the world championship framework will "be a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.
Black believes that "he needs to develop something special in Scotland" and the United Kingdom's light athletics have to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to carry it on until we find it out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British light athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are Medal Answers, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will be on the 5000 m route against Sir Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A series of athletes, regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally introduced were great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will join her fifth world championships at the 400 m hills, says that it is "incredible" that 16 shots are in the British team.
The largest total number of athletes in the world championship has been in Scotland, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.
Muir's middle track runner runs this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another shot that should be observed after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniiversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other shot in Lee McConnell team was.
The crew captain says that she is "shortly proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only one of the teams, but in some cases also joining the Medals and the Finals.
"The special thing to be a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me, it makes it something very special for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the shots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we came.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise on podies.
What is my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and there'll just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics via Facebook: Do not advocate a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of choosers
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers hit him for everything from internal policy to his political principles.
He was crushed in criticism, sure.
But he didn't bring his critics to silence.
Because in 1783, Washington said: "The freedom of speech can be removed - and, stupid and stupid we are led to battle like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employee has blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union complained him about the beginning of this week.
The staff of the governor released the complaint as freeful, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hot head.
He has shown a firm hand in the direction of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect to his electorates and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called officially and by employees paying with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and eventually dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the acts of the governor and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hated people who swing the pizza online.
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Law lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crime.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hatred crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and are not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor employees called "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "president language".
The Facebook Era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to gather and burn newspapers with critical guide articles, or to arrest demonstrators and bring them to silence.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first official who is criticized for having inflicted Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is charged by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell in Virginia last week.
The president of the Board of Supervisors of the Lououdoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Director James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers took his lead.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolles.
The people who used pseudonames such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions who criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington project.
But he didn't bring her to silence.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are part of the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty is hoping for domestic comfort in the next three days, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organises the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which led alongside the Archerfield Links last year to the Endrunde before losing against Paul Eales, is connected to the new place of excursion and serves as tournament messenger on behalf of the founder and CEO of Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he reaches his reputation with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry made a great job when he set this place.
He is a zealous defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great show window for this course."
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a mastership for the first time, although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That really feels special," said the player who lived in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.
Come back to this part of the world is magic.
It is a wonderful place to play golf games.
The memories from the last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to the action on home floors.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I am happy about how it has gone."
With the trio on the field, the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are among the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with one inmate and £ 10 per car with two or more inmates.
All redemptions go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Lower lung cancer due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer.
This results in a study by scientists of the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"After our estimates, 167 cases of lung cancer are due to passive smoking per year," said study director Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he started his own study on this issue of 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new investigation was published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Household connections prove very complex
The construction work in the Villinger street is in full walks and " lies somehow in time", says the leader of Fred Heinze.
In the field of household connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since in the underground much is hidden, which is not noticed in the plans.
Transport, which is constantly obstacles to construction work, represents a major problem for the Stumpp company's construction force.
"The ignorement of the drivers against red amps and locking grids is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road is locked and only the line buses are entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite hard to do.
But fortunately, we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a flock.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the chamber.
After half an hour, the cold knob is taken and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the leather - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, for example to wash clothes with dirty water from the nearby sump.
A butter in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drinks hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the high country of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, as only 1.026 elders should vote by a public recording before the crew troops.
An existing movement that affected independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta Government, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, where the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as far away as it is destined. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the province of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive with the car hire.
There is no public transport.
The city with approximately 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo bastards, and of wave sheet decks transformed by rose into various yellow brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, as journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wear these clothes," says Degei, indicating their vibrant, handwoven turban, her dark shirt and her bright rock.
"We used to have only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of the people live below the poverty limit and have some of the worst children's mortality and alphabetisation rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a high-land province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015, Freeport has declined gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars.
In addition, Papua has wood resources in value of estimated $78 billion.
These wealths, however, are a source of distress for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia’s mighty military preserves a shocking presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that freeport local military members and units paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150 000 US dollars to one officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated without mercy.
According to activists, over 5000,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and arrested by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass deaths in Papua's family hochland in the 1970s, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission, became a people's murder.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3.900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" says in a report of the arch diose Brisbane from the year 2016, in which reports of the cruelty of the previous year include, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electrical hits are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal destruction of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as events happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring a flow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic developments change as Muslim economic immigrants come from the population islands Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Maintenance Cantinen sell broke chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable with earthnut sauce served.
Local people fight to stay here.
"The migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables cheaper on the traditional market than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai resident who moved to work in the province headquarters of Jayapura.
"It cost the local Papua - the Mama-Mama [the Women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to deal with inequalities and infringements in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.
The former roomman secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, a little has changed, and today the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Yokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowis' dedication, Paniai suffered a deep point in October.
On December 7th, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs before a camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them that they should turn their headlights on.
One of the soldiers incited her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and struck the group with their gun collars, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby Government Commission was burned and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football area in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and carried the waita dance - running in the circle and a bird song imitating - by Papua's Mee Pago stem.
Some demonstrators began to swallow stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses do more than three times resist, they shoot them dead," says a official document by TIME that was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto Quartel of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for peace and asked the crowd to return home.
No one was listening to the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left handgle," he said TIME on the veranda of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says that the ball came from the rows of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overfilled, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, the witness of the shootings.
"I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was," said Yohanes, who as many Indonesians only carry a name, the TIME in darkness.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Head of Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers wanted to "safe" their station only because they were attacked.
"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the speaker of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrations were killed and many others injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta only on the next day 'filtered'.
Three weeks in Jayapura, Jokowi held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to deal with historical misconducts in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra court mechanism to settle historic human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 90s and early in the 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to deal with these infringements, but there are processes that must be passed through," he said.
Then Wiranto took a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all things are legally regulated," he said.
Wiranto, who has accused the UN of "criminality against humanity", who demanded more than 1,000 victims of death in East Timor's bloody independence vote in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights infringements in Papua have already been attached, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Paniai sacrifices accepted such claims with cruel disbelievance.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was struck by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"When I had buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shooters haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drunk when he fished in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Refugee villagers protested in front of the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by fireing warnings.
But locals say that the mobile Brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the crowd and killed one.
"We were so paniced, we are afraid there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and was witnessed as the injured ones were quickly introduced here, so the TIME.
"I hid in my house two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called on to take the officers involved to account and to withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribe members of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highland of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army who claims to defend the rights of Papua by entering sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitraryly arrested in recent years, under the preamble of "security of national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua is Paniai known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for residents.
Bread is just as out of reach.
People here are cultivating everything they eat: especially note and fruit and leaf crops.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 100,000 Indonesian Rupia (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between local Papua and the new migrants, which have arrived in a larger number since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nabire.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better trained and richer migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary capabilities to conduct its own companies competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because here there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Board of Stammes of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting remain excited to international media.
In the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Vice-President of the Human Rights Watch Asia, the promises of Jokowis's electoral struggle to lift the limitations of reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realised.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia's distressed eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," he said in an explanation.
The lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the "different and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the claims of the group and said to journalists in Jakarta: "There is still a democratic system in Indonesia, and there is free media, so it is difficult to destroy the evidence of human rights cases."
The people on the spot want more foreign governments to note this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human rights messenger Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited on 4 May, locals broke their silence and pressed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say that they will probably not vote again for Yokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, Chairman of the Board of Stammes.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from the constant threat of a rubbish military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Yokowi as a "should" he has to pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want righteousness," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, the families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a final symbolic act of defence: the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly to the police and military station.
They know that they may never come to justice, but at least they do not let the responsible people forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'Torch' cloud crater of Dubai for the second time
A fire found on Friday in one of the world's highest living towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 metres high, 79-story buildings.
It is the second fire that feathers through the highhouse in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (Fackel Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We've been sleeping, and we've risen at the fire alarm and at the crying of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor," said a resident who indicated his name George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting at 4.00 p.m. local time (0.00 GMT) cleared the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working on the provision of accommodations to those concerned.
The incident can resurrect questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-houses around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damages from the clothing, the outer clothing to decoration or isolation, occurred.
In Britain, the police said that they believe that the system of plates for isolation and clothing at the London Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June, where about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Next Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed through with his great Davis-cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh city, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was not supported by the required two-third multitude to play Davis-Cup single only on two profits.
The five-satz classists who are often very long, but also very appreciated, are therefore still receiving the traditional application.
63.54 percent of the Member States voted for the reform, so the objective of the ITF president David Haggerty was hardly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our Member States have not accepted the entire reform package for Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," said Haggerty.
You will continue to work on improving the applications.
Not only to vote, after many objections, had already come before the proposal to put the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018, there are only relatively smaller details: the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host law in the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs of the organisers, the requirements in training spaces etc. will be facilitated and the players will have to graduate less official media sessions before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden items into the plane, finding out an survey
A flight passenger survey showed that more than 20 percent consciously or unconsciously prohibited items were smuggled by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while wearing accidentally forbidden knives or other items with cling.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had seen that they were wrongly traveling with shot weapons, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a Jet Charter Service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers are rather disregarding the rules.
Of the respondents who confessed that they were knowingly trying to fly with something that was forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 percent were thousands, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of generation X.
The most frequently passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to having carried objects with cling by security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the plane.
The company said it asked travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had brought through airport security and how many would have done so intentionally.
It is not surprising that the people who are the best smuggling products - knowably or unwisely - are carrying through the security, those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are a little complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain which fluids they may take or how much of them.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the largest amount of liquids contaminated by the TSA is prohibited.
For a while, people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggleware.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't matter: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
El-Tausendsassa Elon Musk would like to specify with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has hitherto suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their unobligatory reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic marketing targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk, when announced the latest quarterly balance sheet for the first time, has revealed another, less glanced number: that of the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often been hired with the more than 500 000 pre-orders for the new car in the last few months, whose delivery is just starting.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only unobligatory reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the United States 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "Reservation payment" completely.
At the moment, 450,000 such unbindable reservations were provided by Musk at a telephone conference with analyzers.
That the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could be a problem, however, the Tesla-Chef does not believe.
His argument: The challenge of the ambitious growth goals is not the demand but the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 it will be - all models collected - 500.000, 2020 a million.
The demand for this is evident.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you may expect the delivery at least in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla is able to drive its new, never-to-practice production roads without major interruptions with maximum burden.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are more delays, then the unreliability of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then, the company cannot prevent unsatisfactory customers from running away in crowds.
EPA-Chef Pruitt withdraws because of the delay in the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions
One day after it had been accused by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the Head of the Environmental Authority, took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama Era in order to reduce the emissions of Smog causing air damage.
Pruitt presented the change when its agency showed the needs of the state environmental authorities to react faster than the previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint which had been raised against his previous office in a Bundesrufsgericht.
It is a deadline for States on 1 October to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground-natural ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "mixing into local decisions or to hinder economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a state prosecutor of Oklahoma before he was appointed by President Donald Trump, was long a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental legislation.
Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly overturned to block or delay regulations which resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden return of Wednesday is the latest legal return for Pruitt's regulated rollback agenda.
Last month, a Bundesrufungsgericht in Washington decided that the EPA manager exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane lecks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its turning to ozone standards simply enhance the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"In former administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the time-limits for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and set the date for implementation in agreement," said Pruitt, who complained more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation by judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority that there is to us seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPA's opinion stated that Pruitt will sometime use its "competence for delay and all other legally available powers" in order to ensure that the rules are "based on a solid policy and the best available information".
The Republicans at the Congress are insisting on a more comprehensive reconstruction of the ozone rules.
A draft legislation approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The New York General Attorney Eric Schneiderman, who directed the coalition of the States who had complained the EPA this week, said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by Smog, who flow into their communities," said Schneiderman.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the Columbia district.
Soil ozone arises when pollution from cars, power plants, oil refinery, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight.
The resulting Smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of the public health and environmental protectionists rejoiced about Pruitt's surprising course change.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to keep this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crossing of the Trump Government to offer themselves to environmental polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrate 750 years St. Hilarius-Kirche
750 years St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, an ancient Friedhof Areal in Tumlingen is invited to a Serenade at 16.30 p.m. on Sunday, July 16.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the Sixth Benefiz Sereade can be thundered by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and supporters of tumbles their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique little bitch."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Capelle was for the first time mentioned in the Württemberg's documentary book: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the so-called parish church to Tumlingen as well as the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
The words of the document, in addition to the first priest church, were also a glorious court in which the church or patronat law belonged and not reversed.
So there lived people there too.
As the description of the Oberamte Freudenstadt of 1858 shows, next to the subdorf and the Oberdorf, which are currently known in the local image of Tumlingen, was the "Berg" of the third, the glorious settlement core of the village.
Old maps from time around 1600 support these historical circumstances.
The law of the cartridge was based on the right of the early medieval churches.
A master who built a church, equipped and occupied with a priest remained owner of this church and could also inherit this church.
This was related to the right to take up a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two clocks on the tower.
The larger of the two breaks on Christmas in 1673.
The newly created bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but later in World War II in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were hit and the bells were stolen.
The roof was not.
In 1796, French troops were stored near the church.
They broke out the canvas and church chairs and used them as firewood.
The rest of the church threatened to crash in 1809.
By 1869, the Tumlinger-Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing twilders.
In 1823, the Friedhof was extended and the Hilarius Church was discontinued.
Only the church tower was left.
In the New Year’s Night of 1834, a storm split the church storm and half crashed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was cancelled.
Only the tower that is still present today remained a witness to the 750 - year - old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schafige Rentners" as a successor of Dieter Dockhorn, maintain the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, the friends and supporters of Tumling on Sunday, July 16, invite to the sixth Serenade to the old courtyard to the St. Hilarius Capelle.
This is shaped by the Combo of the Kepler gymnasium Joy City and with words from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Urgent Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 16.30 p.m.
Introduction is at 15.30 p.m.
The Serenade's outsource takes place a drink in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view of wheat to the forest," the organisers show the fantastic view.
The Serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organisers are hoping for many supporters to maintain the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tummling and hearing twilders.
The friends and supporters of Tumling feel specially obliged by home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to check the approval of wind wheels
"Boisheim is fighting" does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the country council.
The Association "Boisheim fights" called for Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its authorisation for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boisheim net.
It was incredible.
The Association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, there could have been no approval in the Boisheim net, since at the time in fours there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border at Svalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind energy systems are essentially possible, while the concentration zone, however, results in exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being "saving".
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim net a few days earlier by changing the area use plan, which had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf because of a form error.
"Due to the lack of the planning legal condition, the authorization issued continues to be illegal and therefore also withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim fights himself".
Current state of things: The City Council has again decided the wind concentration zone in Boisheim's net before the summer break; an authorisation of the district government is still out.
Recognise: "This means that, at this point, the granting of an authorisation for the establishment of wind-energy plants is excluded from planning".
The circle confirms the receipt of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received in the Foursen Circle since last week," explained one speaker.
The Circle takes them to review the matter again.
However, they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped.
In view of running procedures at the Administrative Court, the circle did not wish to comment on the argument of the Association "Boisheim is fighting itself" on Thursday.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans on a surface on the Boisheim net the construction of four per 200 metres high wind wheels.
Last year, the company, where the city of Foursen is directly involved, had concluded pacht contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares large terrain.
The construction of the four wind energy plants aims to cover the electricity needs of around 11 400 households, which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Linnich Windpark at Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind energy facility in the district of Heinsberg in Øvaach-Palenberg.
Car and tractor collapse: Woman dies in a terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday form at 10 p.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was injured fatally.
Two more people were easily injured.
The country road remained locked over hours.
According to police details, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her car in the context of the accompanying driving with her 53-year-old mother as a companion went to the L 333 to Bogel.
City and dealer plan "Homeshops" weekly
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The business association and the city management want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping pool into the city centre.
As the Chairman of the Business Association, Christian King, announced, the "Home Shopping" weekly will sensitize the customers for what offers are available to their own city besides the usual supermarket war.
Therefore, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies are to present themselves with their training sites.
In addition, businesses in the city centre are to be invited to "midnight shops".
The action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the nearest region.
In preparation, advertising spots are in the radio, a Internet video and printed bags pointing to the action week end, says Christian König.
City management and business associations cooperate with the Industrial and Trade Chamber.
Thus, the business association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive Innenstadt".
These include new offers, such as the first "Activity Day" at the spring festival as well as sales open Sunday, conversations with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the absence of parking fees this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be re-opened or re-opened.
These include Kurgasts and tourists.
But many indigenous people would have lost the city in their shopping.
At the end, everyone would have to contribute to living the city centre - to renters, the businesses of the entire city and associations.
It would be appropriate to overcome the lethargy, which was partly widespread, with a network, the king had said in spring.
Birgit Streich, Head of the IHK Centre in Mühlhausen, announced that the third "Homeshopping" day in the country, for the first time five Thüringer cities participate.
Besides Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sammeda, Holy City and Bleicherod.
The day was to "advocate more for the appreciation of local trade and its importance for the common well-being of our cities", said Strik.
The action under the Federal Management of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his purchasing behaviour can influence its direct environment itself.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine more have been hurt, some of them severely.
According to the firewear, on Wednesday (local time) another injured person was in critical condition.
A man died when a part of a school building crashed in the explosion.
A first missing man was also dead later.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of accident, the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline.
At vacation, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put Mexico under pressure for the payment of the border walls after transmitted telephony calls
Transcripts of phone calls between President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on a telephone with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. President confused him because he had publicly praised the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump started his presidency campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States and swore to allow Mexico to pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed an excited exchange.
Mr. Trump said to Mr Turnbull that a trade for the United States of Refugees who emigrated to Australia would be "laughing", "mys" and "dumb" and that the existence of the trade that the government of Obama would make him look like a "dipp" after he had proposed a ban on relocation of refugees to the US.
Mr. Trump ended his call after he said to Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Massaker: Activists resume racist lynchact as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury went through a group of audiences in rural Monroe, Georgia, and drumped to the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns came out to block his way.
The leader of the mobs - a man of medium age in a needle strip dress - took a long train on his cigarette and looked out on the windscreen.
Inside, the inmates swept in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man cried.
"Keep him out of the car!"
Screaming crushed the silence when a young black man was scattered by the bicycle seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a replica.
But then when a strike is thrown around the neck of "Roger", nearly everybody in the audience poured out very real sucks.
Since 2005, citizens' lawyers come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lined by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been accused of murder.
"It is really impossible that in all these years no one person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organisation of the replacement.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former member of the State of Georgia and a lifelong civil lawyer.
It serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want criminal persecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to maintain justice," he said.
"We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A court doctor puts a bed linen on the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford linen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been accused.
Although suspiciouss have remained free for decades, citizens' lawyers say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the preselection struggle in summer.
Approximately at the same time as the election, according to the FBI of the black farmer Roger Malcom, a white base owner, Barnett Hester, during a struggle - supposedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city had been that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she had wasn't from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white country owner, paid $600 to release Malcom from prison, says the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they went away from prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes a FBI report.
"It is also evident that there was a complot between the state and local criminal persecution that was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and defiled the identity of witnesses."
Brooks still formulates it.
"It was an electoral Massaker," he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you can register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual post of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their representation is obvious, fascinating and is justified in a kind of deep racism, of which many want to believe that it does not exist in America anymore.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that it's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch because then we are faced with its harshness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the blacks - pushed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is a Greenes co-director.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan member for years, but he said that the role never becomes easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tested their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who crys to Hester and presses him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There's a break.
And then everybody (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene's laughing most loud.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still cooking.
"I just don't think white people said a--he said."
"But," one of the other black showers joked.
"You just have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy moves in the room, a feeling of companionship replaces unpleasantness.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he tells it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repeat ends violent and fast.
There are shouts, shots, and then silence.
A woman dressed with a grief dress stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays sad lobrede "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozens of viewers turns out of their eyes of sweat and tears.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple are from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are just coming down the street.
They have experienced all the humidity of Georgia for nearly eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels exciting.
When the last notes of the song go out, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body names.
Children hook on their heads, register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whisper each other.
"You're not really dead," murmurs a little boy like he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks for the quantity - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw the Lynchseil away and wash their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit that played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks in her arms crying, the emotional burden of performance eventually breaks through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that this isn't in your heart.
You did this for one reason."
Later the audience joins the audience with the actors for dinner.
On a table, a white couple from Atlanta is stimulated on the posting with a black pair that they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that have left the performance.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and actions ... come from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the Lynch is still going on," she added, "this day it is only called police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone Brook's court holds at his table, he eats and reminds of citizens' rights.
He said he's already started to plan the performance next year.
"The subscription is in some way inspiring, because it describes the horrors of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's the way if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever doesn't study his own story, who doesn't know his own story, is condemned to repeat it."
"Goddamm" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf also sets on a bunt-frivol insensus against gigantic, six-six-stage sculptures.
The turning stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shabby street corner as well as wallrest and Danerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes Old Hour parks where the Rhine daughters pose as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil vessels remember Castorf's lead motive - money, power and greed - which is attracted by its "ring" incentive.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess deceives Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), breaks a body into the suitcase room in Hollywood manner and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the glorious feather that surrounds the aura of a gravity boxer.
Brutal the scene when he hit Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with a strong applause.
Sturmically, Foster, Milling, Vinke and Dirigent Janowski are celebrated, who humblely bow their hands to Merkel-Raute.
There is a great appreciation for the festival orchestra, which appears on the stage for the first time - given the great heat again in army leisure clothes.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his leadership team was expected with excitement.
If he had had to have another arousing pheif concert on himself in 2013, five years later there was a great joy in which the individual "buh" calls were underwent.
Champion Katharina Wagner might have enjoyed it.
"Man notices that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has made not only a form of peace with Castorf but it has also grown a understanding of its viewpoint.
I'll draw a positive resume.
Max Menge works as volunteer
They work in their volunteer year in several places.
Whereever?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture basket, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I also worked at school in the open whole day.
How are your experiences with that?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years now, so you're a late volunteer.
How's that coming?
Quantity: I made abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, canceled successfully.
I realized that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there's an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, perhaps at the focal point, really.
And was it that way?
Quantity: I collected great impressions.
I'm going to start my social study in winter semester.
I'm going to study twice, probably doing a social worker training in the Youth Office of Herne and studying in Hamm at the University of Experts.
Is it not something unusual to have several different places of use during volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It's probably always about where you're doing his FSJ.
You can make it from age home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work.
It was very different from me.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike the construction engineering study?
Quantity: Well, this is not about calculating statics.
You have always other people who have a different story behind each.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to consider it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any touch fear?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that's a lot of one.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson shortens further 3,000 jobs and shortens the dividends to resume the business
On Friday, the British Pearson Education Group said that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, since another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces.
The degradation of the jobs, mainly announced by Director-General John Fallon for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, is in addition to its previous restructuring, where 4000 jobs were already lost.
In May, Pearson announced another 300 million pounds of cost reduction plan in a third cost reduction program (394 million US dollars) in order to relive a business that was taken by the fast step towards digital learning.
The company, who had sold its participation in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack by Kabul: Nato-Soldat killed in suicide
A suicide killer has attacked a military convoi in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a soldier of the NATO and injured several others, says officials.
Five soldiers and a interpreter had been injured, announced a declaration by the NATO.
According to unconfirmed local reports, in the event in the district of Qarabagh, three civilians died.
The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
The NATO's opinion states that the explosion had occurred on Thursday evening when a common patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised bombing rate" carried by persons.
The statement states that all injured persons are in a stable state and are treated in the US Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a great concern for the NATO troops nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civil victims in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20 % were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shiitic district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had done this attack.
On May 31, a huge bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the most deadly militant attack of the country since the U.S.-fighted troops expelled the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underlines the precarious safety situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump considers to increase the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in the past few weeks the suicide tents in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policy and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay the Smog rule according to complaints
The U.S. Environmental Authority has suspended a decision to delay the regulation of Obama's government, which requires the States to reduce the Smog-causing emissions. This happened one day after 15 states complained the Agency for the step.
On Wednesday, the EPA announced the decision to forward the so-called "zone 2015" and said to show the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with and in reacting to our state partners," said EPA-Chef Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to measure the ozone regulations - which are to be measured in a part of the country's pollution emissions to determine where cuts must be made to comply with more stringent air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, complained on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by the former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda to encourage economic growth, according to Trump.
However, efforts have led to the relapse of democrats and natural protection groups, which are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the inhalation of air that contains ozone can "reduce lung function and strengthen breathing symptoms" such as as asthma.
The Council of the European Communities wants the Community's area
At the end, the decision was clear: by two contradictions, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Wunzels decides to establish a Community area in the future senior residential area.
There is an important information before the discussion: the purchase contract for the missing part is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will continue to take until the area of the church community has been owned in the municipality, there is no planning obstacle for the project to be voted by a private investor now.
There is a debate on a Community area.
One of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a totally 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipality's councils propose that such a Community area should not be a meeting point only for the inhabitants of the senior right of residence, but openly for the community.
For example, the word "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which has been adopted by the provision of funds for the current budget in the last autumn, will be remedyed by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a Community area, reports Tjaden, would be eligible by 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision to signal the investor that there is no need to throw a knob between the legs in this respect, suggests that both satellites - which is relying on the environment - and pultdach - would be possible to reduce the height of the gate and make the construction more economically.
Unnecessary, so Wilfried Sohmer does not just think that is this addition.
If it helps, he happens unanimously.
It is not so easy for the Community.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you do not come so right forward, for that you now reject to the Community space from the window, she says, "I'm doing hard with it."
Yvonne Staiger is essentially speaking for the Community area - but absolutely against local participation.
It looks behind it a hidden subsidy to investors without any means or even outside.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give a grant, but will receive a real, in doubt marketable countervailing, is the object.
Staiger's request to break up the proposal for a decision accordingly shall be given three supporters.
Thus, in two contradictions of the original programme, Stefan Haller summarises this way: "If we take the decision like this, we take a huge step towards closing a gigantic gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: wheels are thrown on road
On the crossing of the road, a 82-year-old bike driver in Garath was taken into account and severely injured by a car on Wednesday.
As the police reported, the 82-year Langenfelder was on the road to the Black road from Hilden at 12.20 a.m. with his bike on the road.
The senior wanted to cross the trail at the height of the road at Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
However, when the long fields went to the road, he seemed not to be careful for the counter transport.
He collapsed with a car that managed a 66-year-old hildener.
The man was thrown on the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from the supercup against Borussia Dortmund on David Alaba and Thiago
The supercup takes place without it: David Alaba must let the game sauce against Dortmund.
With staff care, the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first duty game of the new season.
Seven professionals miss the supercup title defense against the Pocal winner.
The staff cares at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are increasing in Pokal Sieger Borussia Dortmund before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30/ZDF and Eurosport).
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also refrain from David Alaba in the duell with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
In addition, the coins Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeat in the last six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti and added: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good at last."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official duty game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualitys.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligent," said Ancelotti, who expects a "tough, intense game".
The dual of the two German football weights draws the fans into their ban.
The party is sold out with 81.360 viewers, the German football Liga (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walk in the harz from star to star
In the harz, the first "star path" is to be created in the bottom.
This plants the Verein Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the need for information of many hard visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and star images.
In a first phase until 2018, the association is planning "goodly accessible installations at five to six places" in the upper harvest.
Inquiry would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegit and Sieber.
The information on the tables should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network receiver plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path is to be extended train by train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example, about the physics of individual stars," explained the association.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why a star shines stronger than another, although it is far further away.
Also, the constellation in which a star is located and when it is best to see.
Since 2014, the Association has operated in the mountains of St. Andreasberg the highest stars' waiting for North Germany.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Protection.
Often from there the dairy road and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen with only an eye.
In the Uni-Stadt, the Planetarium Göttingen has been initiated since 2003 and has been similar to the planned star yard - the Planetenweg.
At the beginning of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the inside of our solar system, the planet's path leads up to the Hainberg and to the observatory - as well as a "external" location in Diemarden (common equals) with the planet Sedna.
The stables with each planet, including the degraded pluto at the endpoint, are set exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres diameter, while the exactly 75 meters away sun measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet road is four kilometres.
While the light from the sun to the Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stable with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the space.
The march to the next fast star would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomaakko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomaakko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to focus the most exciting box fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN-Büros in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unmuggled World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the hall to welcome Lomaakko, the World Boxing Organisation Super-Federgewicht-Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former Four Divisions World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pounds for pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomaakko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 19 p.m. on ESPN.
When the pair positioned for photos, Lomaakko-Manager observed Egis Klimas that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I am a former feather weight," Garcia recalled.
"I have risen for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I am not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I would like to go down on lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweighter [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them that."
Lomaakko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomaakko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 Knockouts) which also has an interest in fighting against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23 September.
"This struggle could take place in Pay-per-View mode because all fans asked for it," Garcia said and later expressed themselves open to fight with the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomaakko as "a huge fighter", and he may be going to participate in his Saturday battle.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought that the three-fight champion from Riverside looks"very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said that the focus is to show a stroke strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the moment that built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that has to be carried out.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomaakko said, "I waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured by tyres
In case of an accident on the A7, four people were partly severely injured on Thursday afternoon.
After first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control over his vehicle at 16.30 a.m. shortly before the point of accession.
The truck threw to the right into the evil, where he struck and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partly severely injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked to the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left trail at the accident site could be passed.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Dry chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 to the seasonal uptake against Braunschweig that optimization of the defense formation brings Aue points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game, with the result, as the two counters wouldn't have been against Braunschweig at 2:2.
"There were two counterparts too much, and we need to be even more careful in Aue," says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the archipelago, the triangular chain is also intended to be further optimized.
And a gate after a loose run, the fortunes will no longer catch themselves.
"For the future it will be so that nobody will be on the line next to Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that after the experiences in preparing the three chain, his team will be better accomplished than with the four chain.
"Now I don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we just have in the three chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can well build up," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is, but that we are even better harmonised and we do not make so many play errors in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"If you can talk about a failing start after a disagreement, you don't know.
The performance could be all right," said Hoffmann.
"If we are there on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the pokal, we will surely be able to speak of a ordinary season's uptake."
His coach didn't want to know anything about that.
"I don't want to speak of any advantage to Aue only because the Sachsen game in Heidenheim had to be interrupted early because of a storm," said Friedhelm Funkel.
"Now they can start the season quasi with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher because they did not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know 100 percent where they are currently standing," says the interior defence of the Fortuna.
Although the guests from Rhineland go to the event in the final (fast) stadium of Aue as a light favorite on Sunday.
"That we dismiss them, only because we have the right to come into the first six, is stupid," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Federal League that must be struck from before," explains Fortunas Chief Coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Asylum Evaluation Tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years old, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (Richtsmedizinalverket) has started carrying out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of the age more precise during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) has been criticised for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were less-yearly.
Until today, Migrationsverket has sent 6.880 testing cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from mid-March until 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson, from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results remain in the past months.
"We see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum applicant has lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "propose that the investigated person is 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that it would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings are made by knees, which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they went through the puberty earlier or later.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Rating the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't act as if we could," he said the newspaper Metro.
However, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of unfair assessment of a child as adult is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full in the plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well advanced.
On Wednesday, a seven tons of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good in the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction leader at the road and traffic department in the Freeburg Government Presidium.
In April, the work began at the same time at all three necessary bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building end is intended for October and it is easy to ensure that the schedule is complied with.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads through the Trombach.
It is a bulb bridge of concrete, clothed with red bundle sand and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
She was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure the stability and safety of transport, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The two other bridges lead through Lauterbach.
They're made of red bundle sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 meters wide on the north side on Wednesday morning and seven tons of heavy bridge cap.
This is a edge fixation that is also used as an operating route.
On the southern part of the bridge, a bridge cap of 2.20 meters will be used on Friday.
Then, then, the walking road.
The special thing is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger Company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special finger-spits feeling requires the movement of lines through the construction in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fiber cable that is connected to many companies.
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by handbook.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building and the collective wheat towards Schramberg, the traffic is uniquely regulated by an example.
For the construction work at the bridge at Lauterbach's entrance, the road in the area of the bridge is fully locked at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden".
The costs for the three bridges are totally EUR 700 000.
The whole is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest in German potato salad
It is not so frequently that parties are striking, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is difficult to put under a hat.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) represented on the volcanic day belong to a wide band, which shows a peaceful flag this day, because the AfD invites Rondell to the Gerolstein City Hall, according to the poster "great electoral battle-uptakt".
And known names bring at the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the peak duo for the Federal Day election on 24 September, and the Vice-President Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on the spot hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD learners but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains bunt."
Originally, the city-picknick was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the wellplace, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that is available there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forums One world and one of the most important organizers, is really happy: "How many people have met here."
There is music and a lot of food, including a "urt German potato salad, which the AfD could eat without trouble," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is just a few meters away from the locations of the event.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reports of the AfD Vulkaneifel that he has strived for such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first asked in Daun, but had received a cancellation there because because of the already built Laurentius Kirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here."
In view of the event at the Rondell forground, he says, "This is the good right of people, main matter, it remains peaceful."
This is also the case: at 20 o'clock, there is a band of entertainment at the Rondell premises, in the city hall various speakers, including the Rheinland-Pfalzische AfD-President Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Federal Day election, Alice Weidel, and the Vice-President Beatrix of Storch to hold their speeches.
Unchanged is the police presence, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
Some more than an hour the AfD event takes, the guests on the premise have a longer breath, but there are also cleaning up shortly after 21 o'clock.
The police can decline - no special incidents.
Posaune hits trompetes
There is a rehearsal with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli in the series of Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 a.m. in the Monastery Church.
Together with the Bulgarian Trompeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea Measures on Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" also meets a classical German training with roots in the blas music.
Both solists are winners and prizeholders of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European peak orchestras.
Petkov is solotrompeter at the renowned concert building orchestra Amsterdam, and Frederic Belli is a soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unite the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments but also to merge the boundaries of the various genres.
Thus, Johann Sebastian Bach, like in a new garment, ends up with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of the Jazzecho prizemaker Nils Wogram, Daniel Schnyders' "Weltmusic" combines classics, jazz and the free games into a fascinating total artwork.
This core piece of the programme was only carried out this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it specially for the two musicians and more more: The Haslacher Klosterkerk with its special acoustic is consciously included in the concert.
Christian Stewart talks about their bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat him until the end of their life.
But I want to try out everything," said Christian Stewart quite openly about their bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'"
The well-known relationship of the Hollywood Star was to her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who finally was bitterly interrupted.
Despite all, the brunette shower assures the Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was in love with every one I have dated.
Or do you think I had played it?"
After their separation, Christians admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and believed seriously in it.
So it's never confused or disturbed me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously."
She suffered especially among them, according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, as she prefered to dress himself like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very much.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bus.
I felt really attacked, scared and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think, "Chief, be proud of you!"
Especially the public, she does not like to explain her love life: "The people expect you to behave in a certain way and that irritates me.
And perhaps some mention me as awesome, but I don't like to justify me before all the public."
The governor of West Virginia announces that he switches the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have gone away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and many thoughts ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I am a democratic governor."
The announcement broke out in joy.
"Morgen I will change my registration to the Republicans," added Justice.
"As a trainer I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a great announcement before the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not accept the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which is the only billionary in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes finds that he has coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business by his father.
He's worth $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday evening, saying: "The change of the governor of Justice is another struggle for a democratic party that would prevent us rather than work to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governances and control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party, which is from top to bottom without lead and is not able to find a positive, consecutive message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe commends "early" Russian Excuse for Doping Scandal
On Thursday, the world head of light athletics, Sebastian Coe, commended what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be re-introduced into sports.
Russia's Leichtathletics-Chef Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress in the evening of the Light Athletics World Champions that the ban on his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said that he was sorry for "all athletes who were taken away from gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban, which was obliged in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of Stately supported doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleasant" about Russia accepting the criteria for his re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-introduce Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything in the next months to normalize this situation.
The principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added:
Nineteen Russian athletes will join the light athletics world championships starting on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria as neutral players.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re-administration.
Drug tests are still insufficient and prohibited trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Sadness for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a wedding celebration in the North Hessian Fritzlar, about 1,000 of the two soldiers who died at a helicopter crash in Mali thought.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Domain under high security measures.
The defence minister Ursula (CDU) said nothing about the still unexplained crash case.
She called the two killed pilots, but she called "Kunners of Her Fach".
"We defend ourselves from this highest victim they made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from North Hesse had been killed on Wednesday a week ago in Western African Mali.
Their sarges were transferred to Germany and accompanied on Thursday by a dead guard of the Federal Army to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter.
In the afternoon, only the members of the church did say goodbye.
Afterwards, the sad feast began in the circle of the family, close friends, representatives of the Federal Army and politics.
Among these were Hessens Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Sad guests put roses down, the relatives stood in the arm on the sarge.
Before the church, Fritzlarer and many soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence minister of the Leyen called the deceased soldiers "highly decorated" and experienced.
The Stabshauptman built the flight operation of the Tiger in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regime.
Also Volker Bauersach, commander of the regime, to which the soldiers belong, said: "If this crew couldn't turn off the crash, no one could have done it."
Doubt on the UN mission in Mali did not show minister of Leyen that the use is dangerous.
But he is also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the sad feast, the sarges were brought out of the court.
When and where they were stored, the Federal Army did not provide any information.
Prinz Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be reared next to his wife after his death.
This was announced to the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish king's pair is added in the dome of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophage for the two.
The Queen agrees with the decision of her husband, then it continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, be still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be confiscated in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a hole because he was not happy with his title.
After the throne climb of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would like to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also put the title "prinzmall".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted, he did not view himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish king's house, explained.
Where the last retirement of the 83-year-old will be final, it is still unclear.
However, he intends not to be confiscated in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years.
The born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French eagle sex, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Themse in the French Embassy.
During his later wife's sympathy shows of the people, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes.
In a autobiography Henrik said over the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk drums instead of stroke sugar, citroin instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tabak and who had the reputation to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope intentionally.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That's the same thing as two mistakes!"
Minister Weile wants a quick new election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a quick new election of the country's day, but he does not want to withdraw.
Because on Friday, the resolution of Parliament spoke.
Previously, the surprising exit of a Green Member from their country-day fraction in Lower Saxony had crashed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country-day election, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its narrow one-voting majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Green Member Every Twesten justified its step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in their electoral circuit in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Head of Fraction Björn Thumler wants to recommend his group to take it up.
CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in Lower Saxony Land Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship was reversed.
The new country day will be selected regularly on 14 January of the coming year.
Thumler said that the red-green country government must now decide whether they can continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Because, however, it considers it essential that the landing day decides its self-resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its further approach.
The Constitution also provides for the possibility that the country's day will deprive the Prime Minister's confidence and choose a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be legally purely checked," said Thumler.
"You will discuss all the questions in peace when they are legally reasonably examined."
Thumler called the cross-country step "but something kurios".
The politician himself emphasized: "I am not a betrayer.
I feel very good."
She called herself a follower of Black-Green.
The Greens invited the deceased Members to return their country-day mandate.
"We of course assume that she gave her landday mandate, which she received over the green country list, with immediate effect," the national presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner informed.
The President-in-Office of the Green Anja Pil said, "We regret the decision of each Twest exceptionally."
It decided consciously not to debate in the Group.
"Apart from the background that there were no content differences, we cannot follow this step."
SPD-Cancel candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Dutch Green Members to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green Members in Low Saxony is not only betrayal to the electorates but also to red green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-select the country day.
The exit of Twestens costs the majority of red-green in Lower Saxony.
The politician put "in her injured arrogance and in her frustration her personal interests for the welfare of the country", criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony takes part in this dirty intrigen game and is trying to hit political capital from it."
Lower Saxony CDU Head of Fraction Björn Thumler wants to recommend his members to include each Twest into the CDU.
The Head of the SPD Group in the Federal Day, Thomas Oppermann, proposed Twesten to falsify the results of the 2013 country-day election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, SPD and green ones had a thick majority of one voice in the country's day.
Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gifteering, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses polluted eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewed with the RedactionsNetwork Germany (RND) speech and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamp pressure.
On the Consumer Protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarning.de, the Federal States shall provide the latest information about the egg carries concerned.
Eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know today, a health risk is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the informer is not really perceived by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal countries.
However, my house has immediately turned up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the notices of Germany's concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade is to ensure, as the manufacturers, that the products sold are transportable and healthy.
If the maximum residue level is exceeded by 0,005 mg/kg for eggs, they shall not be transportable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time is not the company's fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current knowledge, the production companies do not have a direct debt.
Instead, they have to expect economic damage due to discretionary illicit practices by service companies.
As always, there are too little controls in the serious case.
Does it only lack staff or also decisive competence?
It was just the official controls that discovered the operation.
However, the truth also includes that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded by 100 percent.
This is why a consistent disclosure of such events and the submission to the prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may be committed is crucial.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect an unfair information from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alertism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable foods.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly disturbed.
By means of the funds, manufacturers, dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the holding of foodstuffs is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be informed quickly and unfortunately.
How the financial rules of the football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aiming to prevent unhindered expenditure from European football associations will not interfere with Neymar's world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, because the leading organization that has monitored the European game has the power to prohibit crews from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules set up by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at any time prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million (262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of $10 million a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to France.
PSG can surely make the money relaxed so that Neymar signs and brings it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team through the energy-rich governing family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but must counteract with legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his choice as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations who had committed huge debts in their pursuit of success deceived effectively and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from the concentration to the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then strongly invested in improving the team and building a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP layout period, running until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini fell from the presidency in dishonor in 2015, his UEFA follower Alexander Ceferin continues to engage in excessive expenditure.
"Safely FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, against The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a fixed sale, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sum of the remuneration for the next five years can be shown at EUR 44.4 million in the annual account.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, took the most difficult sanctions.
The PSG received a penalty of EUR 60 million (when 82 million) which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014/15 remain to 21 players rather than the normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to override their financial oversight by blowing up their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a cataric company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be considered as a legitimate income.
This happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsoring of the PSA was blowed up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come into Qatar on payments by the WM 2022 Organization Committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become WM messengers and could be easy to find out such a manuscript for UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more aware of any attempt to avoid the rules.
The UEFA had no preparing conversations with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation.
They spoke with The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The most recent reports show that PSG 2015/16, with a turnover of EUR 542,4 million, has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last financial year must be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot sales.
The association assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 per cent after the signature.
The Spanish Liga was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and state," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily newspaper AS in relation to the final ownership of Catherine at PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsene Winger, whose association is owned by an American sport tycoons, shares the reservations of La Liga against a State that finances an association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Winger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has a union, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, chocolate Frey has produced board chocolate for Swiss.
Now, the sweet cooperation is a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the "Nordwest Switzerland" newspaper on Friday.
According to the current planning, the Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current Supplier Chocolate Frey," said the speaker.
Approximately 17 million small red-weight chocolate tablets distribute to 14 grams per year the air carriers before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to make any information about the costs.
Brancheninsider estimates the contract volume according to "Nordwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of about a billion francs.
But more important is every time the advertising effect: for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious job.
How many candidates are available during the new tender, the Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss producers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, chocolate Frey wants to strive to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
The Switzerland has distributed chocolate tables on board its flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the daughter of Migros, Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with chocolate Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-term flights, customers of the First Class are delighted by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class Nash Passengers Schoggi von Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi by Chocolate Frey also distributes on the short course, both in the business and in the Economy Class.
Light athletics - Discus-Olympiasiast Robert Harting reaches WM-Finale
The three-month world champion struggles on Saturday in the final for a medal.
His brother Christoph, Olympiaser of 2016, failed in the national WM excretion and could only look at the Discus-Wettfight from the Tribüne.
Similarly, with the first attempt, the Polish title defense Piotr Malachowski, who was 65.13 metres far, qualified for the final battle.
Nostalgie goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the Nische
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year-old Grunge-Ara (as the fore-thinker David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch Comedie "The State" turned for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is likewise a parodie and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a Franchise, it feels like the time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking box of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By raising on the core of the gag - actors of the middle age plays yellow children who are growing up - they nevertheless created the inability to win the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parodie goes more according to the casting cannon principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" (The Hand that shocks the weigh).
On one point, a character shocks through an Apple Powerbook, some inline damage and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-bad plot where Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
Like always, the excursions are the best part of Franchise.
It's especially fun to see the ever young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underlip bar from "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker now.
It's the moments of random madness that could heat this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series, until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how it will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another type of nostalgie: the releasing of the Cold War of "The Americans", of the film "Atomic Blonde" and even of "GLOW" with its East-Gen-West Ringf Iconography.
The coma created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighteenth years with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hardly sowed Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to view (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans may do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda droma - a murderer that wears a Reagan mask - that it often plays like one.
In six long episodes it moves there, and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough.
"Comrade Detective", which has been edited to a smaller length, could deliver his agitprop sailor better, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything feed for a location.
The fictional Romanian Creator was not wrong: We do it even with our own younger story and with the heritage.
Battle against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in a battle against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, many objects were searched in the Black Forest-Baar Cruise, in Rottweil, Constance, Essling and Stuttgart, as the State Attorney Constance announced on Friday.
15 accused persons between 25 and 77 years of age were arrested and already issued arrest orders against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in Italy in the same time.
There were German arrest orders against the two suspicious Italians.
The two are likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action was involved in Italian and Bavarian investigators.
Over 300 police officers were in use.
The members of the Mafia will be disfellowshipped of organised drug crime, severe violence, attempted murder, robbery and depression.
Since summer 2016, the State Prosecutor has established Constance against organised drug trafficking in the southern German area.
Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, four officials from Palermo were also accompanying the major effort.
In particular, Italian nationals with close reference to the Italian mafia were shown in the view of the investigations.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, at which several shots were fired to a guesthouse early in the morning, would be expected to go to the account of the bands.
Mode complains about big gaps in foreign registers
"Data from citizens that should not show up there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany shows significant shortcomings.
This leads to partially serious misdecisions in asylum procedures.
The refugee management officer, Frank-Jürgen way, has, according to a media report, made notice of major gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to partially serious failure decisions in asylum procedures and deferrals, warned in an analysis of the "South German newspaper".
The register reported that 10 million people with foreign nationality are included, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good yet.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register."
"Incorrect data inputs can significantly slow backing processes," the report continues.
The statistics on travelables include EU citizens that would not have to get out of the world.
However, such false assignments resulted "to a distorted debate on dealing with travellers", then it is said in the analysis.
In the meantime, the Federal Government seems to have started sending refugee families with less than 16 years of age back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This is evident from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper therefore states that the BAMF will "receive families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this has been practically unable, so the newspaper refers to the difficult situation on the site.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees from the EU Member State are responsible for which they reach first.
If a migrant continues to travel into another EU country, this State can send it back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacities for families with younger children in Italy have increased significantly."
Italy has provided guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Justice of Human Rights (ECMR) considers that these commitments are sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The internal political speaker of the left fraction on the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Family with children threatens because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system of unlawful admission conditions and a threat to child welfare."
Second best result
Totally, 220 litres of blood of persons living in Oberreichbach already provided the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were excellent on Friday.
All in front of Jürgen Greule, who shared 50 litres of blood with its 100 donations in the meantime.
Traditionally, the municipality at the meeting of the Municipal Council appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for it, and we pay respect to the donors who offer their blood to strangers, still unselfish," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood donation helps several people," explained the circuit leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conserves are divided into their components.
So three people could already benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in Oberreichbach in the spring.
"In this year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK cruise leader.
Obviously, the change to the theatre house led to higher participants a few years ago.
Already before, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umber were among the multi-suppliers and excelled for 50 blood donations each.
Half so many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Väter spent ten times 500 millilitres of their life juice.
The Bank of England will maintain the interest rate at 0,25 %
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have diminished the speculation of an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "trage" when it maintains the interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The decision-makers of the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted with 6 to 2 in favour of maintaining interest rates to 0.25%, with less members seeking to increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% for 2017 and to 1.6% for 2018 and warned that the pressure on budget income would continue, whereas inflation is expected to increase to nearly 3% in autumn.
But she indicated that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to reverse the inflation heated by Brexit and she said that the credit costs may have to increase more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also voted in favour of withdrawing a part of the Mammut economic package, which was issued one year after the Brexit.
It will demand time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from and with the coming February, although it has been said that now it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak short-term, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."
As regards interest rates, it reiterated that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" would be required to cool inflation and a "a little greater" extent than markets are expected.
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "steply" and "limited".
The Bank's growth forecasts downwards for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecasts in May.
She maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and decreased by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth rates have dempted the rising expectations for an increase in interest rates and GDP increased by 0.2 % in the second quarter in the previous three months to 0.3 %.
In the third quarter, growth is expected to be 0.3%, although it will be easily recovered after the bank at the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offers little enthusiasm for households affected by an increase in inflation and low wage increases, as the sharpness first becomes worse before it improves.
She added that in the next few years the monetary policy could not "avoid income invasion", but it added that the wages will be "evidently" recovered at the end of their three-year forecasts.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision will come to 0.25% one year after the reduction of interest rates last August after the shocking EU vote caused the decline of pounds.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will complete the prices and the economy.
Before the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates, the call for an increase in interest rates increased as the inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers demanding a 0.5% increase in July.
The inflation has decreased from 2.9% last month in June to 2.6%, although the bank said that this was expected and it will be attracted again in the coming months.
The Bank said that the override in relation to its 2% target would be "assigning" to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in the swap rates, the hypothesis market is likely to become more competitive, since the creditors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and close the new hypotheses, and many with free options and low rates become more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicinal product in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sex is taken, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by approximately 86 percent, is now delivered by healthcare service over a first three-year study for estimated 10.000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the proceedings after the appeal court had confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year, which the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The Thursday chess train announced by NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens was welcomed as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposition prophylaxis (PrEP) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious hazards.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
Among those in question for treatment are dizziness or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Appropriate participants are identified in clinics which agree to the study, including men, women, transgeners and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not knownly controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a home physician can also sign up for possible participation in their locally participating sex clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to evaluate the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as it is targeted to be used, incorporated and implemented.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overcome the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in tackling one of the greatest health challenges of mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted to needy and endangered people, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, Chairman of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one with a risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been created, we are in the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Sharon Minister for Health, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and thorough implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life-changed infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected and that it will contribute to the completion of the dissemination of HIV in society'.
The great life: Intermediate floors and smart designer tricks have transformed these small Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, decreased from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to a Earls Court Apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her pockets.
"I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge before," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was similar to my price.
This apartment was shown to me at Earls Court, and she had the same high decks.
I loved her and made an offer this day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overdue.
Originally a one-room property with a confined layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a vacuum room and an intermediate floor to use the spacious ceiling height optimally.
"I wanted high decks, big windows, much light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she assigned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high decks and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms across each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
Invented had to think creatively to solve the standard.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to blow ourselves.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but to build the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height over one another - with a lot of extra drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style of the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is reflected to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.
The entrance offers mirrored units space for all cocks and glasses of Joanne.
Through the perception of a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapseable kitchens are not new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garagent door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," Erfan explains from the stolen, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push up the door, it glides very easily."
Thanks to the smart use of space and vacuum, Joanne was able to win additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate maker will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to increase the soil surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that provide its luxurious advantage to the space.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional binding in a home," Erfan says.
"You don't get in love with the electrical plugs in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that a apartment can turn into something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters of something standardized.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate imperium
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation because of one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. This brought him to the Supreme Court to explain how to divide their property and business assets.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but there is a sharp debate on separation in the Supreme Court of Justice.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 real estates in value of more than half a billion dollars, collected since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail businesses.
It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the forest city.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul described as "main operator and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of company assets and Paul about one third.
One legal act states that this means that Colin owns $316 million and Paul has the value of $176 million.
The breakdown of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place on Friday after several failures.
The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but insists Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers held by both sides.
Mrs De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who worked milk bars and delicate food business in the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the first Jeans shop of the family.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years high school when Paul was still a small child (approximately 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give her property kindly to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, whereas Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark are, Paul says, "become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin was a former member of the AFL board and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can't really say much," because the case is before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to complain about me and to draw our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said, adding that "he's still hoping for a solution".
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be solved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trumps new Staff Chief Plans to limit the President's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new Head of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the media, in the hope of keeping the boss at a more even course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Staff Manager of the White House, met with his first working day with senior employees, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wants to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the President.
Kelly said to the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letterings - because the President would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to team trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television is decades back - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If the candidate Trump was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report of posts that were convinced," said the former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habits under control, according to six former electoral officers is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits were ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know to others - that Trumps Tweets would have contained more ignition without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweets who didn't send a trump.
If his employees have been able to keep troubles away from him several times, their efforts have rewarded.
But no one has been able to consecutively prevent Trump from causing controversials.
A part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are constantly trying to put their own agenda forward by presenting trump material that may encourage their views from the world.
Politico - fully involved in this story - reported in May about the favour of consultants to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmaker:
"Current and former Trump officers say that trump can react as a volcano to negative press sections, especially with damaged leaks, and that he can find out where they come from.
That was just what happened at the end of February when someone evilly accused the President of a printed copy of a article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocate Charles C. Johnson, who accused the vice-president Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a bunch of lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of shakans, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence, or that he said wrong claims in the past and rejected them.
Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then Staff Chief Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "had tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper crochet, receiving the trump".
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still seeking influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.
Most seeked criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the support of the population is requested and hoped.
The police throughout Europe sends (virtuelle) postal cards to dangerous criminals on the escape this summer.
Since the addresses of the sought serious criminals are not known, indications from the population are hoped and prayed.
Europol reported on Friday the action followed by the EU Most Wanted Advent Calendar from the winter.
Experiences would have shown that many refugees hide from vacation destinations, it was Europol's name.
21 mail cards for seeking criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been visited over 2.5 million times.
36 of the online requests could have been arrested so far, at least 11 of them due to information after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to 'Millionary Rice'
Some of the most prosperous owners of the West Midlands stand back with some decided travelers on the war feet, who have negotiated a grave drawn from the municipality to demand a field back in front of their master houses.
The travelers have parked their 20 campsites on a field outside a wealthy road from Solihol, called the "millionary series".
They brought horses, babies and a army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May, but without being scared by a grave excavated by the Council in order to prevent their invasions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defence facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Anxious inhabitants have pressed the Solihul Council, who said it is "nothing to deal with the problem".
An anonymous inhabitant said: "They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passengers.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement, since it was unnecessary in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are back now.
More came yesterday evening, probably more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long training to protect her parks.
I live on the streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area."
A spokesman of the Solihul Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country outside the streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihuls. We take the necessary legal steps to continue as soon as possible.
In order to support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof, Forest Hotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Forest Hotel Luise is located.
The house is currently renovated in front of the gates of the joy town and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closing of the Birkenhof Hotel through the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30 000 nights per year lost and also revenues through the Kurtax.
In the autumn of 2014, as a result of a dramatic increase in the number of refugees who arrived in the district, the hotel building was offered to the countryside as a collection accommodation, which provided for controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum applicants by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not inconsistent at the municipal council at that time.
But most importantly, Oberborgenermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious stakeholders in the house.
He should keep right.
The group of Luisenhotels with manager Birgit Scherer with seat in Bad Bergzaberne has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category called Foresthotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the happy town.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Park Hotel Luise and now Forest Hotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been standing for a long time before the entrance, and when you enter the house, the extensive renovation work will be done.
The floors were shaken out, covers were partly debossed, old baths were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There is still much to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the black forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large accessible showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built.
Everything was to be "beautiful" later, as Thomas Scherer said.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated inner city level, emphasises Scherer.
The forest hotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to set up wide, explains Scherer further.
Both individual holidays, groups or businessmen are to feel well at the hotel.
Conversations with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause have already been conducting, so Scherer.
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Ask for the amount of the investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define itself precisely.
Just below a million euros, he's counting.
The external installations are also brought to frontman, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace, which will be accessible by the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."
Russian Business: US Special Measurers use Grand Jury
In the Russian affair about US President Donald Trump, specialist Robert Mueller is supposed to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The body has taken up the work in the past few weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote on the subject with people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper appreciated the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
The transmitter CNN reported that there were already the first preliminary charges of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. Secret Services have been accused of the Kreml for a long time to have joined the presidential election campaign in 2016.
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump's election team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations is on several men who acted in the electoral struggle as an advisor of the Republican.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more trumps of private and business environment under the lupe.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the specialist Trump personally entered the center and examined the contempt whether the President may have disturbed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the evidence available in possible crime cases and to decide whether to charge charges.
Grand jurys are therefore also called complaints.
Mostly they will be activated when it is larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always under closed doors.
The body can also be activated by the prosecutor to invite persons to an inquiry under oath.
According to the transmitter CNN, pre-loads have already been issued that are about the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Persons involved in the meeting were invited to make a statement, said the report.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr., Trumps consultants and son-in-law, Jared Kushner and his former chief chief Paul Manafort were also involved in the conversation.
On Thursday evening in the US TV, legal experts said that the introduction shows that Mueller is not intimidating in his work and, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be activated at the end to decide on the collection of a charge.
However, the establishment of the body of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new discoveries, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russian story is a total invention," said Trump.
The subject gives the democrats an opportunity to "feel good because they have nothing else that they can talk about".
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion, he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But these work also usually in secret, he emphasized.
The White House welcomes any action that accelerated the work of the specialist in a "fair" way.
The former FBI Chief James Comey said three times that it wasn't against the President.
There is no reason to assume that it has changed something, said the Declaration.
But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.
Because of this outcast, allegations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to impede justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to stop the investigations against the national safety adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the specialist and his employees.
That caused speculations about whether Trump Mueller wants to be released.
Unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, such as in the Watergate Affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the press of the President by the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties, however, want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday which could not be so easily released by the specialists.
Antarctica: Giant Iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a giant iceberg has solved from the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin from the Shelfeis.
On Wednesday, the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Maritime Research announced this.
The colossal large cosmos now drives northwards over a billion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres and will probably take two, three years until he was melted.
He is one of the largest ice gigants that researchers have registered in the past three decades, with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometers.
A danger to humans does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear after research.
However, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice creams in the region, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.
Many researchers believe that this could be related to the heating of the earth.
The now interrupted Colosse was part of the Larsen-C-schelfeis.
Shelfeis is swimming on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
It thus grows further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-schelfeis is located south of South America near the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
At the north of this shelfeise, the balance of waxes was disturbed and canceled a few years ago.
A complete shield was broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
It speaks some of the fact that the Larsen-C-schelfeis is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is.
In addition, the ice plate is under voltage and can be broken if a piece breaks at a key point.
The melting of shelfeis and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they swim on the water and ice pour as much water as it is after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelfeise leads to the glaciers to mouth directly into the sea and to flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C shelf is the fourth largest shelf of the Antarctica, according to AWI details with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.
On the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge of the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Even though it is a natural thing and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
"That's the biggest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Under scientists were controversial whether the Larsen-C-schelfeis would grow again or go back long-term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not lead to the breakdown of this giant iceberg to climate change, in the past decades very many ice creams of the Antarctic Peninsula have been destroyed.
This long summit of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up about three degrees over the past 50 years and is counting on the areas in which the temperature is rising the fastest.
CDU wants domestic tariff at the staff
Since it becomes more and more difficult to occupy free offices, the CDU calls for a withdrawal from the employer association to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the circuit day went through 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circuit management in Mettmann.
Now again, 17 trainers have their first working day behind themselves.
The teachers in the circle are apparently very desired.
About 620 applications were available for the places to be forgiven this year.
However, further staff are lacking in the circle in order to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
There are still 50 non-occupied positions in the circle of Mettmann.
They are seeking doctors and engineers, as well as powers of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the circular day and to face the lack of expertise in administration.
The management is intended to develop a concept of staff gain and development, as the parties wish.
The aim is not only to cover the short-term needs of professionals, but to counteract future disadvantages of applicants, says it.
The overall concept should focus on inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-seekers and include a training opensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with staff problems that you did not know before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is of a regular "competition of public employers".
A high number of employees who are excreting disease or older condition from the service are here.
So the maximum time for action, so that no more places remain unoccupied.
However, Klaus-Dieter Peoples, Head of the CDU Group, continue to go beyond the common application with his party.
He recently provided a thick surprise on the circuit day when he publicly questioned the staff cost coverage and the rest of the parties surprised.
People want to be reviewed all the possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the local employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the circuit administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the circuit cities - should seek a household tariff," says People.
The CDU is thus trying to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for the public service tariff regulation.
The wages are currently precisely required, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is based on professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be established where employees cared for the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least by the increasing number of asylum applicants, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Circle Director Martin Richter have a problem: you have too little staff.
Italy intensifies the sound of NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin Daypaper La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German Aid Salvation Organization because their team had worked effectively with human dealers in a way that helped illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself to the detailed claims of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us is and remains the salvation of human life our primary priority, so we are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and salvation zone," the organisation said in an opinion on social media.
"We can assess all the accusations currently being raised only after we have collected all information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat from 'Young Rescue', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew takes swallow boat migrants on board which are delivered directly by human dealers and that the smugglers can ride so that ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libyan, according to the Act of the Prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected to oversee the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue efforts in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Behavior, boats like the Iuventa must have a Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue efforts have so far declared themselves willing to follow the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Last Thursday said that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring with themselves "actual changes or disabilities" of their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize Organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has decreased considerably over the past few weeks, indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and cooperation with local civil championships have carried fruit.
"In the last days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan Mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Tschad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Outstanding Posts" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palace to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friends' guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley was a good starting point for the tours.
The Castle and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
At hot summer temperatures along the vineyards, the first tour led to the Michael Kapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed prospects, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the forests and the pre-layered planes.
Between that, there were repeatedly longer increases that rewarded long trials.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, the prospect point reached the point of view, connected with "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many metres have been seen again.
Catches, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and inlet cabins brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in the free air inhalatory.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and nearly 4500 metres of height, the group had met the forests from its best side - sporty and cultural -.
Konsole instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is equipped for e-sport
Do the sport stars sit in the future before computer consoles, instead of fighting through wind and weather over the stadium breeds?
In fact, e-sport has been a seriously increasing industry, become a lucrative business - large stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments including.
This has also recognized the first Federal Leagues who are increasingly involved in this area.
The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and last VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sport department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope that this will enthusiasm all new young target groups for the VfB," says Chairman Jochen Redtgermann.
He's sure that "this is still going up on this train".
The next weekend, the FIFA football World Association organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the gamers of various clubs join each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have been qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football has to deal especially with the 14 to 30-year-olds that the young people are still going to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially Asians.
With prominent e-sportlers under contract, you could be present on the Internet more frequently on these markets than sending the Federal League to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
On e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the FIFA football simulation are being fostered at a competitive level.
Longest, as in normal sports as well, ligen has established, in which the professionals have encountered each other.
And in the Asian games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it at all a true sport?
For many, the idea is surely vital.
Ingo Froböse has also been dealing with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive capabilities, technical and tactic understanding and rapid reaction ability.
Professional gamers should not only train their bodies at the console, but also take care of the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Froböse, however, also sees problems: "Doping becomes more and more a topic."
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
Positively, the scientist emphasizes the high integral effect of the e-port.
The players are internationally on their way, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of company consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts a rapid growth to the E-Sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years, turnover will be 130 million.
Against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football alliance, this is little.
However, the e-sport is "not far away from the other established sports types such as handball, basketball or eishockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Many countries are still international.
Large markets are Asia and the United States, where Ex-Basketball Players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actors Ashton Kutcher invests in eSport bettanbieter Unikrn.
Some things are also doing in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a teacher, says Froböse.
According to Dutt, in the Netherlands and in France, the Football-Erstliga Associations are now obliged to set up an e-port department.
"In the European comparison, Germany hangs behind," explains VfB Board of Directors Redtgermann.
Only to fall in Nostalgie, and to declare the old times, it is no longer enough today.
It's about maintaining the association's tradition, but the company's focus on the modern market at the same time.
"We live in a digitalized world," also Dutt says.
"There is no way you can stick to the fact that only in the football everything remains the way it was always."
Gift egg ade - The egg alternates for cooking and baking
The scandal of poisonous eggs is now affected by almost all the federal countries.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord have responded and took all the eggs from the sale across Germany.
Only eggs that are shown to contain no fipronil should be taken into the shelf.
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that push Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was condemned to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind grids and five years have been suspended for revalidation.
Carter was condemned in June because of negligible killing by Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing, "My family is unfortunate.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free until he was called.
She had been faced with a maximum punishment of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a psychic disease.
Carter was dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse, with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was condemned.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She did not take responsibility," she said.
"She didn't repent."
But Carter's lawyer said it's a "a terrible condition that she totally regrets."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said that he did not find out that "your age or maturity or even their spirit disease has a significant influence on their actions".
A prosecutor read an explanation by Roys' mother Lynn Roy, who said there's no day in which I don't grieve the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I survive with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains we will bear with us for eternity," says it.
Roys sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "tested" by the knowledge that she would never participate in her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"Not anymore have this one person with whom I have been with each day since my birth, is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to put a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case raised national attention after Carter’s text releases revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Stop up, jump from a building, first yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murder to her British companion in Italy before she was released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new mini lamb of FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up at the Audi Cup as a captain is no chance.
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner to a large season - extra motivation does not harm it.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the additional piece of clothing was very small.
But since the second day of the Audi Cup was, of course, no Philipp Lamm and no Manuel Newer to see, he made himself the tie assigned to him to the arm.
"The trainer has not announced it," the Confed-Cup winner later, after his first use as Bayern captain.
Well, the agreement could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also indicate Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been elected as a game leader in the C-Elf, which came from youth players, debutants and just from the vacation.
Sugarl is distributed to those to whom you are familiar with much that you want to keep at loudness.
So whoever has been elected to enter the inheritance of lamb, can use a small extra motivation only well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew over the field as a mini lamb.
Right behind, this is now his position, the white tie on the arm did your rest.
And at all, Kimmich acted in this start formation as the one who can best take the rod in the hand.
He gave instructions, tried to guide the unplayed troop.
He had the look for the whole, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal with this to overcome his lack of fitness (appeared hardly); Renato Sanches to get out of the devil to the services of the Asian trip (which was only conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle do not notice negative in their first appearance in the Bayern Tricot.
That always worked very well.
Süle ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy from the defense, both acted sovereignly.
The namely occupied Napoli tower often made difficult, and the silver also tried a few times successful in the construction of games.
Although his colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not like we hoped that."
But he also showed a ordinary performance at the debut.
Game shift, speed change: "For this style I was also picked up."
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the new access, one saw after the party.
For example, Rudy did not have one or two interviews in the catacombs, but definitely six or seven interviews.
Kimmich adopted a few snatching statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard from Süle a interesting sentence: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
In Bayern you just have to win every game."
He has no longer to teach the new one.
Alaba motivated ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer reported himself on Twitter shortly before the game and wanted all good to the ÖFB ladies.
The Bayern Legionary is indeed quasi club colleague of ÖFB-capitänin Schnaderbeck and fevers with our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivation syringe.
The famous Bayern shower might also need our ladies well.
Enterprises satisfied with Rheinland-Pelzischer Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often unlikely that the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was neither economic minister of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This can be seen after more than one year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Company (VTU), says: "Whissing grabs the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked."
The largest turnover sees Natus in infrastructure policy: the gap of the 1 motorway between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
Still this year, the Ministry is hoping for a plan-defining procedure, until 2021 the construction right is intended to be.
A role in the plans of the country also plays the West surrounding Trier, which is in the necessity of the Federal Traffic Traffic Plan.
The aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020, says ministerial speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to support regional but international competing companies.
The Industrial and Trade Chamber (IHK) Trier, as is suggested by Wissing, seeks a Rhineland-Pfalz label on the wine to increase the sale in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have sucked for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, the IHK praises.
The craft chamber Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainers in the new Master Bonus, says Manager Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of EUR 1000 is provided for for the master review and EUR 2500 when students make themselves independent within 10 years of master training.
The home tasks list for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is to create facts quickly, at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, head of the IHK Trier business manager.
Of 56 new engineers who want to set up Wissing in the country industry mobility, only 29 jobs have been occupied.
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices.
The CDU fraction vize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, investing the country in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million less in the conservation of country roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country as it wants to fix the lack of expertise in the region.
It is also enthusiastic to the past broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed the network supply in an IHK survey only with the note 3.4.
They complain about stocking Internet connections and breakdowns.
Ex-economic minister Eveline Lemke, however, is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the Windkraft Company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe, where, after four months of disagreement, she was already clearing the field.
Audi is intended to change 850.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter-reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350.000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that "a smarter option than driving restrictions" and thus refers to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is resident - to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the businesses as a callback.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The costs of automotive manufacturers to install installations for neutralisation of the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, which makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.
The German Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel is also accused of negotiating the mighty automobile companies and ignoreing the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the failures of Volkswagens that could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested, but which could return under normal driving conditions.
In the United States several officials were charged by Volkswagen, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former director of the thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought before court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to deal with the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request concentrated on the United States has been extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be severely burdensome: the luxury automotive manufacturer contributes overproportionately to the gain of Volkswagen.
This message has the fleet on Saturday on Isar
The city wants to protect Isar.
In order to join the Isar visitors, on Saturday, a fleet runs through Munich, which has a special message.
If it moves to the Isar again on Saturday, he will see a large fleet between flaucher and Reichenbach bridge there.
And this is not a usual fleet, with Isar tourists.
In particular, the building referral wants to learn.
On the fleet, you can see a great information transparent.
It shows a wasteberg.
The entrance to a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Wahre Love is ..." the understanding of Isar as a protective wildflow is to be strengthened.
Last summer, the fleet went over the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerable and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillos Knollennas and the Laugh against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon signs, the knolnases of his figures are his brand marks.
Also, with 85 the Argentines are still drawing and working on a movie.
His message: Laugh, 'for there is too much suffering in the world'.
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he struck himself as a signator for congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day that was lost in my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he succeeded at the end of the 60s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artists of cities inspire themselves again and again.
Gross, round Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the skiing tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Place in Moscow.
In the early morning, he is still sitting at the sign table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About Calendars, Puzzles, Books for Gross and Small, T-Shirts, Pluggers and Clocks continues to find a lot of spread around the world.
He has also been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with its figures for six years.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a Giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand fists as a opponent.
For the first time, his figures are spoken in the 3D film that will come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
It's not written by him.
Therefore, he rather puts on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wheretless.
Lavendel from the Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in South France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavendel is declined due to the conditions of dryness and the disease transferred insects, which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The Lavendel in the Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the impact of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This affects the lifetime of lavendel.
There is also a small cigarette, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot on the game.
Lavendel oil attracts not only holidayers, it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with etheric oil."
The solutions to be considered include a better water distribution and slowing the dilution from the ground, but also the determination of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thüringian Rhine celebrates its 1200-year-old existence.
The celebration is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Creams, coins, merchants, vagants or a country servant are to be experienced in the city in these days.
The killing of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the Riodoce weekly newspaper usually meet to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
It was told them that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, which were the goal of an attack with granates in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to be standing on the government's or the cartel's paylist, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest break of violence, and while the bodies in the whole country rise, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered his office in December 2012. 589 are attacks and threats under federal protection and until this year there were at least seven dead in seven states.
Her publisher and inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas, are among the last ones.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs on the fassade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although 2010 a special federal lawyer was set up to deal with the cases of journalists, it, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, initiated only two criminal proceedings.
Like most thousands of murders that are associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought before court.
With Riodoce, they are still in the process of treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are unfortunate and although the terrain is even more betrayal.
Without information about the murders, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we all distrust."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot on him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - translated with "Twelve River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Injury tends to flee freely around in Culiacan.
But in the topic of Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, since rival groups fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-sticked miceoles for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for one minute that there is a state of "ruhe" when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the fault that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalizing cartel fractions in war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have irritated the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaperskioske.
The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own security after the seizure of another newspaper who had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the smoking problem," said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and the turnover and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to publish thorough investigations without fear of censur, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dare to treat.
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Price" for its reporting in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trade in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take over the task you like as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead people... why didn't you tell me what happened?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could fluke like a harbour worker, the friend who was generous with arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar against the office, and sit on the same table there.
Now they ask, Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and remain alive.
"You don't like it if you occupy with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their secret start and land courses" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censur and self-conservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "a sense that can be betrayed ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries, where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggler routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the space where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. Days before was known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers searched for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 °C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were assigned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself called untrusted.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug bands are de facto under control.
Riodoce has looked at three main stories for the issue of this week.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposition to the government expenditure focused on the home city of the governor.
And there was a group that took away a kidnap in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the lawyer's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the governing institutional revolution party (PRI), which ruled almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high-quality cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this local, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had viewed the columns of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.
"We had already known what happened before," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slank body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."
Valdez's office was converted to a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they had never expected themselves: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was detected and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Journalists across the country have become louder by writing "SOS Press" in organized protests on walking roads and buildings.
This day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out and killing them because they said the truth.
She has since asked for her re-dividing by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were “omringed” by organized crime, government officials involved and an inferior society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug bands but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were under a roof with organised crime.
Last year, the media guard group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials.
"You die in Mexico because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.
Apparently, the murders have a terrible effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas Card: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were located next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after her director's murder in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cartel with a lead article on the headline with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have escaped from their home Member States or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in a flat in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poetry, admits that the drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexiko goes to hell, and therefore I became reporter," he said.
At midnight the last Friday, when the last edition had already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the climb before the office and drank beer when all their phones began to sum at once.
A number of shooters with bandenrivals and security forces near the Mazatlan Bath had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of Kartell messages in the region.
From the edge of the board, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirenen cried nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez threw a look at the police who kept a guard to see if they were ready.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose medium finger was visible for all Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"How can you just think about closing it," said Bojorquez, "if the same day when Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used tarnung to eliminate his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a terrible.
Researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian mining worker were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his shoty skin was of redly brown - and they said she had something of a "unruly past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" called him "the best-bearing dinosaur who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier, which lived in the middle of the cream period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible well-conserved state has surprised scientists who describe it as "incredibly remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the parked plant feeder is the best preserved fossil of its species.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grew on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock at the place, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology.
They spent the next six years exploring the wild beast within 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth clump.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you only blinded a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was sleeping," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.
"It will come into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurians."
Researchers have found that, although covered with a armor and is similar to a walking pancer, this plant eater was likely threatened by meat-frying dinosaurians.
The strongly parked dinosaur used a red and white tarnation to hide from robbery, and used a protective technique known as counterestimation, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to be better mixed in its surroundings and to avoid his enemies, says experts, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurians.
The 110 million years old creature from the families of the Nodosauriers made the first time in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a teams who spent more than 7,000 hours exploring it carefully.
The amazing conservation of the copy made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shoes and arms on his body.
They discovered the contershading, a widespread defence method in the animal empire, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the contour shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta exceeds far the size of the animals living today.
It indicates that the dinosaur has been hunted with sufficient pressure through meat freaking dinosaurians that evolution favoured the depletion of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals who use the contour shading - think of rice, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which indicates that this nodosurist was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong robbery behavior on a massive, strong-pantsed dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur robbers must have been of the creide time," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life, including its preserved intestine content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was driven into a river and driven out into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea ground.
At that time Alberta was as hot as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably more widespread in the country than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is fully covered with conservated sculpture skin, but also remains in three dimensions and keeps the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early cream time.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you only shone a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he's sleeping."
The creeping time was a time when giant theropods, meat-fressing dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, went through the earth.
Though the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the peasant dinosaur was hunted by some of his fear - inspiring forefathers.
This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was sank and mumified in the sea after death.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-reserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snauze to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long peaks that ripped off his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the parked plant food was swept through Western Canada until a flooded river flowed into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater cultivation preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The stoned remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin residue still covers hollow pancer plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is rarely like a profit in the lottery.
The more I see it, the more confusing it gets.
Steened residues of the skin still cover the hollow pancer plates wearing the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward.
I can count the screws on his soles.
In the weather: Mass Caram Company on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass caram company.
There are many injured, kilometre long stable and gaffers.
At the Stuttgart-München Autobahn (A8), about 20 people were injured at a mass caram company in the late Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information from the police, nearly 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were interconnected between the connectors of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg Landkreis).
The precise number of injured persons was first noted.
It's about mild to moderate injuries, said one police speaker.
A great offer for rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was fully locked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a 10 kilometers [10 km] backstorm was created.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the opposite route - through numerous gaps.
The firearms recorded the marks of the vehicle controllers, which now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on his way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Groups test "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everybody has experienced: nothing else is seated in the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep in your work and have just a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
Come the shepherd and wake up an unsafe or rip the passenger in the middle of the workflow.
Traffic card control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The German Railway is currently testing the craftsless chart control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and thus discount the ticket.
At the moment, a test operation is running on two routes.
"If the offer comes, we extend it.
It will then be available on many further distances in Germany at the beginning of the next year," said a train speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" calls the train the driving card revaluation without a shepherd.
In order to use them, however, some conditions need to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what, in any case, most passengers do.
You must also have bought it through the app of the train that DB Navigator has bought, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And last of all, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" functions as follows: You get into the train, call his ticket under "My tickets".
The test customers then appear a button for electronic devaluation.
The train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train companion comes to place Y at the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with an already worthy online ticket.
So you can continue sleeping, work on, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which is to use the passengers again.
"If you want to relax without ticket control by our train staff, you simply check in in the DB Navigator.
This allows the passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs."
Whoever often drives trains, knows that in addition to delays and missed trains the ticket controls are one of the biggest troubles.
Because you often have yourself, but in any case one of the travellers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the personal card or any other document you need to present.
The result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers, which leads to bad atmosphere in the department or large space and delays in controlling your own ticket and the crew at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart dinner.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How did an activist learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stole over a post from someone from the high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said there.
As nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweet on their Timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was at the time to twin live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo..
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay four hours there.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was no new thing for her and her community.
She dropped her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets over people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who cried, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who had a sign with the recipe: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed where a policeman was standing before a group of demonstrators with a bunch of dogs.
In another video, she said, a different policeman assured his gun and screamed, "I'll kill you all animals."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This isn't the kind of murder we used to and we can typically call."
At this moment, I felt shock frozen.
I was angry and cried."
She bowed a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, she picked her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinema from 11th anniversary.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of people living in the Community and filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who had a flower dress and a suitable crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning “over the black experience and the black condition”.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her," said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be trained in it.
It must be well developed, not only activeism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we need to do to get free to liberate ourselves.
Even if I have the happiness to give her an experience that she personally does not experience an equilatant racism, she is not different from the next black woman kid.
I feel I would show her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place toward the police authority that became a camping area when the activists waited for the possible non-vocation of officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activeism for Ferrell began to adopt.
"My activeism has changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that she, as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, was President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
In weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration of Sabah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado farrar were just trying to "document" what happened.
A question asked Ferrell, "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This Skepsis was nutrited by countless cases of humans, often by whites, in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in a interview, "We had heard that people who were born and grown up in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already collaborated with then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activeism about death transcripts.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other residents, the team of "Whose Streets?" followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary film isn't someone who talks to us or talks to us. We're talking," Davis said.
"This was the main thing for me, as these people are being represented, because so I will be presented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant of the movie.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she loves herself and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
Ferrell's history also repeats the role of black females in the wider black-live matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, which, after the death of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identifies itself as gay.
"Black, heavy women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, female women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it states that "this is not an affirmatative type of action", where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity.
"She was the person who raised this energy," she said.
"It's not a chance, although she was on the front, because in a life on these crossings as a black, sworn woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long gone, but the racism of relations between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on condition for 21⁄2 years due to the blocking of a motorway in a demonstration.
She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home "A Chaos".
Still, she climbs to a song and she feels obliged to remember that since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Droom" to "Size Won": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, even though it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the topic hardly one.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfriend Bitburg" the topic is discussed.
While one says to the bit gallery, "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really classy" (Nicoles Schausten), it comes from the other side: "Don't use any man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Great swallow!" (Lars Scholz).
While the advocates are building on a gallery to move more customers into the city, of which the rest of the businesses benefit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone is bleeding out.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the ground where the farm market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work, this will end.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the reconstruction - to the Beda place with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying in the farm market hall for many years almost week.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of farmwomen are always very pleased.
We have also discovered the mettery for us.
We would wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer.
This is also available in other cities.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers are seated in a market hall in the gallery, the height of the rent is reached.
But it is not likely to be very low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothes, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find this overflowing.
There's already enough of it in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a ordinary weekly market here, it is even more important that at least the market hall remains for us.
For, however, the product offered there is fresh, mostly directly offered by the producer and is above three price.
As you see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, as the rentals there are often unavailable for a retailer.
Damns, special businesses are almost no longer available and what is left of them will then also disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't match Bitburg.
Above all, where is the farm market hall going during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in durable, if the bit gallery comes at some point.
Or does the Spent Bit Gallery already make it possible to dispose of all transactions from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "This just won't work.
And a shop center that stands empty doesn't need anybody.
I think it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery.
But for a farming market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bitburg no more place.
If the farm market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will be disappeared."
A suitable similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticable - that hang on cables from the roof.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen toups and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analytic banned a 35-year penalty after she published the website of WikiLeaks as classified as secret diplomatic messages.
The new exhibition, opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (a suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united its expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transfrau and dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithmical analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomical data could look, a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways of interpreting them and creating the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been speaking openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six infringements against the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her picture was oppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grain, black-white selfie, in which Manning is apparently unwell sitting on a driver’s seat and wearing a platinum-blond pearl - with which it was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette thumb and cage rubber by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.
It was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artists and her imprisoned museums became unequal letters friends who exchanged several letters over two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foretold a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would transform and it would be able to see the exhibition personally.
That Obama would actually demand a few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, two-capable ways to further eliminate the starrous breakthroughs he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a particular reason."
In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded its overwhelming signature below (the "i" in her family name is devoted to a heart) a end to "automatic fragmentation, whose base has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feeter of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all, by integrating the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist).
"What people are hoping to take from it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also to see.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so it's 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novelle.
She shows Manning how she appears from the United States disciplinary classes with a free-speaking phone in her hand, such as King-Kong.
"If they cold your speech, they won," says it.
"Never hold your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia.
"I'll still get the skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if it should, it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by its own genomic simulators, which are together like hordes of protestants.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind their liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
A country-wide human hunting is ongoing for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who is looking for as suspicious after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been incurred with fatal injuries.
On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest orders were issued for murder because of their claimed participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Cook County Office Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority indicates that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of the event, and detectives investigate the stiche as murder, while the police actively search for the two suspiciouss, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of university relations, said in an e-mail declaration that Lathem was now in vocation and was excluded from joining the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter that is examined by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A speaker of the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and willing to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspiciouss to put themselves to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of stay, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Management Team published an explanation to the inhabitants: "The police are currently working on the time and background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives, including a possible home incident."
"We will finish the WADA ride plan in the near future" - the Russian Vize-Remier Mutko
The Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA flight plan was updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA driving plan to comply with the code which describes RUSADA's replacement criteria and has recently been published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to worry.
"All has been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren claimed to have publicly supported dopings in Russian sports.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programmes, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."
Mutkos words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales station RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody wants to accept this report without condition," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the Doping Scandal.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be resumed.
Aldi sells no eggs more
This was announced by the company groups.
It is a pure precautionary measure, and it could not be assumed that there was no disturbance in the health, it was stated in the Communication.
From now on, only eggs are expected to be delivered to Aldi, which have been demonstrated to have been tested negatively on fipronil-containing anti-leaving agents.
Aldi wants to produce clarity and transparency with his customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," Errett said, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of human resources start-ups is on the wax to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it allows companies to carry out surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleves to handle the C-suite leaders and contact the Management Board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for persecuting their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees engagement.
Errett said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a hot card of the company that shows on a look which units have most complaints and which leaders have low consent results - so you can browse down why.
Enterprises come to realize that a former employee has to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you will not become the next Uber that has been involved in Skandale since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of disasters in which those who spoke have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business option.
Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year, in the middle of the Uber-Fall in miscredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently logged in as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "Puls" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the main manager is involved, complaints are directed to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion covered the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and manager of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats his employees badly or unethically, it can experience expensive consequences by consumer-boykott, employees' fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their business centre.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company centre, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees.
Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by leaders who were in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, disaster or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this entire 360 degrees view in the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Enterprises began to take ethics, values and employee commitment more seriously in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical infringements through the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it lasted until the "Social Media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with repeated fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have both supported start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is an increasing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than ever.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are only engaged.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feels that their voices belong and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors reach return when their portfolio companies run well. Businesses run well when employees are working and engaged.
If the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and the use of employees, it is not surprising that you find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture are important.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take measures.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come quickly enough, or at all not, this can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have seen too much trust in the collection of data.
"For if you don't follow, employees ask themselves, "Haven you really heard me?
Are you worried about it?
And who you don't take care of, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, says Errett.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to deal with the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights on the employees, and it hopes that in the long term, this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose business.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It goes to 23:00 when a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the team's new exercise fields at the campus.
Some have pulled out their tricoto parts and showed the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are registered at the summer courses will return to their graduation tests after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"This is a real step mill for the boys the next three days," said Bruins trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 19:15 p.m. to meet the already completed timetables of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playtimes in Westwood carried out practical exercises.
They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their adventure against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the change of rules of the NCAA even if they add another point to the many-employed routes of the players.
"We put this huge burden on them three or four days, and it's very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pressed it, they're putting on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we come until Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."
The UCLA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, given the clear views of its fields from an adjacent parking and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, already occupied with footballs that have a protective network behind a gateway, will not be a easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"That's a real problem, and it's not far from thinking that people rent a room there and then put themselves there to record a exercise.
If you have the video tape of a exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces at parking 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
I don't worry too much about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact review in the fight against false news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third parties and then show their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to combat so-called fake news.
In an opinion on his website, the company said that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to identify possible error messages and to send them to fact auditors which may show the results of the fact review from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of whom believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, where the French electorates have been overflowed with false stories in the preliminary elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they do not succeed, to eliminate hated posts like before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate German declaration that a test of the new facts review will be started in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the knowledge which stories of third parties' fact verifiers are being challenged, people want more context to make founded decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the "connected article" and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages.
Create a comic-Roman: A castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a lushhole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat at Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaary Yorkshireman with a love for historical documents.
"I like to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says mumbly.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another, coming British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpected emotionally found.
"I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobans," he says.
"This is his thumb print!
And letters always smell like smoke, because at that time a fire was burned for the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he would be with himself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who has been struck with old papers that he is supported by National Trust and Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overestimated my welcome"), this seems too beautiful to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyen heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He walked through the terrain and ruins of the ancient castle and spoke with landscape careers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and began writing."
The intime history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as "Hund of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the roof floor".
Daily books, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who had something: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a beer who fought for the two families.
Guys, let everything go his walk!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to come into the English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer' which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer rebellion of 1381.
"There is a record of a rebellion that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
"The farmer rebellion began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good beginning.
Maybe they're connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', who tells the story of the Jesuit patriarch who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century is represented, which centered his own funeral by filling a arch with stones (a discovery made first years later when his arch was excavated).
The Darrells are the Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The Gentlemen seemed to be pretty Gauner, to make debts and to spend money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise inherent."
After the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic-Roman over Elämenmäki, the area of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has been reclaimed by nature since then.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he said.
It was like, "Ah, now I have to get back to the fucking life."
Campaign started: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf sheltered
With the shelter of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday for the introduction of a new roof mark (round show of Thursday).
Even until Thursday, mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there is a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", the makers of the action have been asking on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle yesterday.
"We don't really think this (naturally!)," they write on their released website yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
In principle, we are the strong conviction that we as a Bath Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is important to make a single promise, one which gives the city an indispensable sole position."
Finally, it is competing with other municipalities.
A medium five-digit amount can be costed by the city of Bad Honnef its new roof mark and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Each year in the beginning of August, Ankara of the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and transportation in the Officer's Korb.
Like this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the punish trial.
The meeting took place in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
Under the Head of Government, the five Vice-Presidents, as well as the Ministers of Defence, Internal Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, have now participated in the discussions.
So the civilians in the YAS were in the overnumber.
The government is attracting the cubes in the military.
President-in-Office Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the Army, the Air Forces and the Marine were disposed of.
Since the failed coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of 326 Generals and Admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the series of armies - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile preacher Fethulah Gulen, which Erdogan sees as the wire drawer of the pursuit.
Against 486 persons who are supposed to have been directly involved in the punish trial will be negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already on the day after the Putsch, Erdogan had called the encounter attempt as "God's gift", as he gave him the opportunity to "clean the forces" completely.
But does Erdogan really handle the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the title "Unpleasant in the military headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which manifest itself, among other things, in the removal of the headtuch ban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
In any case, the refining of the army and the security forces continues.
In the mid-July, Erdogan gave another 7395 servants fired by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan tended the military.
The generals were previously regarded as the real masters of the country.
Three times, when they were called, they put on their role as guardians of the world's state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan rejected the power of the military step by step, not least under the call for the European Union's reform requirements.
Former officers say that Erdogan is aimed at isolating the forces.
In the Magazine "Vocal Europe" a no-named officer who was looking for the pursuit of fear of asylum abroad, the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that happens, such development could not make the NATO cold.
In addition, there is doubt about the willingness of the Turkish army in the Alliance after the cleansing.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "sufficient", says NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, more stringent rules for obtaining visa for a temporary working permit and limitations for family-oriented visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft legislation is to be discussed in the two Chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the US citizens from other countries are released Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate route for Rennsteigshuttle
Over the past months, the future of the Rennsteigshuttles has been struggled again - now it is to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it will be built on the marod road on which the tourist track is travelling.
In order to ensure the future of the Rennsteigshuttles in the long term, according to the Transport Ministry's information, building work on the route is still to be started this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and sancing the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country admits to this important connection, especially for tourism," explained Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühle in Erfurt on Friday.
The cost of restructuring the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million.
From this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The Treaty on the basis of which the shuttle is also to be ordered by the country in the future is currently being voted definitively, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and the South Tyringen Railway as an operator are already agreed on the technical details.
"Then the driving plan, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühle.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be concluded for 11 years.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle was to be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the Ilmenau railway stations and Rennsteig.
In the past few months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route of enough people is used to re-order it in the future.
The route is also highly constructive in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just as you thought it could not become more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are currently a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Stifting for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emerited professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founders of the FRR, we have to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the chestwarf and the type of finger nail.
"The people are funny about them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them, and we will see them even more frequently," said Mr Sharkey when publishing his new report.
Modern expups have developed from their blowable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the eye colour of the robot through the shape of the chests to the type or colour of his fingernails.
But it will be even more disturbing, as many robots possess the "performances" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern expups have developed to robots with silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find attractive, such as shakefulness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shock and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted as possible to your personality," warms the website of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods over the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, fixed on Conversation or she can be "in mood!"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlying female properties, the plays on rape, when you go a step to Frigid (hit here: reluctant) Farrah, worried one most.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just hold a different sex toy.
Their origin and increasing refinances point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional assignment.
Of course, most men will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their increasing popularity, they still remain preliminary at the edge of consumer culture.
But what goes through the edge zones can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, where there is a President in the White House who has praised to have attacked women sexually.
The most disturbing aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') is not the graphic pictures, the swallowed bodies and the extruded eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar ratios).
Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, on the point, when it comes to their "performances", the robots do not represent real women.
You can't separate from your companion or simply leave.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
Otherwise, they are delighted slaves.
Or to express it in the 2017 speech: Male
Trumps' great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney into the healthy human mind
It has become a binary evidence of the Trump Era that the political divisions polarized by the US elections have also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Harvest Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of trump-choosing relatives.
We allegedly try to put our filter bubbles.
Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-right poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans of our family, has visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, every one she knows, including the Republican relativeity with which she had fought for decades of politics, is suddenly and very strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I find it in another context that this also poses significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disturbing effect of his Presidency has the power to push us all right.
If we speak of "normalization" and "trump", we refer to the terrible possibility that his girls will no longer dismiss us one day.
However, there is an even more horrible long-term scenario, in which the trump Republican of the right wing "normalized" which suddenly appears to be inconscious of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.
Today, I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for the original version of the crazy man Mitt Romney - the dog on the car roof, the 14% tax on income (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - that both appear as a very mild crime compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify itself as an immense improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carussell in the Central Park, the largest of the New York Park Carussells, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are enormous large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are mumbling and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music means this in a strange way.
So many climbs of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city is not fair to the dream.
Fifty and thirty years later, and I'm still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage - the topic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great circuit in the north of London.
However, the Central Park Carussell is still a strange magical experience, since here two years of age, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I had been able to evaluate the career cell, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced in a buying house to evaluate my "experience" of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could carry my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something over the shop table.
This leads not only to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also to pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is.
The poor woman in the buying house was apologizing, while I was tired of getting her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved out of prison to hospital with breast pain
Pistorius left the prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts at his arms, which he suffered from prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was condemned for murder after a prosecution of the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed stone struggle in the early morning of Valentine's day in 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he considered his friend to be a nightly invasion who was hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors announced their intention to submit this time against the six-year penalty of Pistorius Appell, of which they say it is too careful.
The national law enforcement authority said that it would raise objections to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his punishment will be increased to 15 years when the lawyers are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth classes of feet and epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to the further schools.
Three of the schools are going to the gymnasium in the future, four to the real school.
Schulleiter Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at Biesental City Hall in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of school dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes chose a young eagle, which was raised in the chickenyard, but then released to freedom.
To this end, the cheerful shar made a musical with the title "The eagle in the chickenyard".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it breast out from his chickens.
A small eagle came out instead of a chicken cuisine.
But the hope of making a chicken from him broke, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain, and the eagle went away.
Afterwards, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young goggles, the cylinders wore to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school leader Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (cooks), it belongs to them.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth graduate to feel accepted in his new school.
It followed thanks to the colleagues, the former school leader Michael Müller, who is constantly jumping into teachers, and the parent representatives.
The chicken time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She dismissed her students after two years of education only very disadvantaged because it had been a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the fourth classes.
At the end, all the students had a song of summer and holiday time.
There was great joy in the children.
For the new school year, eight first grades have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal campsite in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campsites in Greece, informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by TV.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegal tentants in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day they were released, while currently an investigation is ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have intensified the control of the free camp and have imposed significant penalties for anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue during the entire season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a penalty.
Software updates for diesel vehicles: What the affected now needs to know
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do Diesel drivers need to participate in the action?
The main questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars.
They are aimed at improving the absorption behaviour of cars of Euro 5 emission classes and partially Euro 6.
Euro-4-diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smethanin from ACE Auto Club Europe provides estimates:
Is the new action obligatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The compulsory updates before apply only to the vehicles that have fumbling software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their restructuring has arranged the power station (KBA).
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next months but have not yet mentioned a precise date.
Daimler has announced to sign up to every person concerned.
However, if an inspection is due, it will be done within its framework.
How long should the re-equipments go?
"Severe to say," says Smethanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on the political pressure.
"For we have seen, the automobile manufacturers do not act to date on the environment."
How long should the update take?
The re-equipment itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop.
Time-dependent it could be to get a date.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group?
The ACE advises to wait.
Probably foreign producers would follow, so Smethanin.
Is a massive price decline of Euro-4-cars now threatened?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In the rural area there is no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait for a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the prizeholders does not want to come from protest.
LL Cool J (49) gets one of the desired awards of the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year's singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographies Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honors.
The awards will be delivered at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, President Donald Trump will take a reception and participate in the award with his wife Melania.
The prizemaker Lear, known with progressive TV series, already announced that he would not participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times" said, "This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to withdraw the funds - and that is burdensome for me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify its viewpoint.
The Kennedy Centre, named after the former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Among the former prizes are Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city tree champion, will be retired next year.
The job is already written, but appropriate candidates are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city champion.
And the work still makes him a lot of fun as he conveys in the press conversation.
He reports of varying, but also demanding, tasks waiting for his followers.
At the same time, he wonders that no application hitherto meets the demand profile.
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the nearest time possible.
Thus, taking into account the regular termination periods, it should be sufficient time for inclusion.
Since Haslach operates for the Administrative Community as a sub-construction authority, the applicant must provide appropriate conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they could no longer fill in them, the citizens would have to go to Openenburg for advice.
But close to the city and itself are important, says Wacker, who reports about a good operating climate and a good mood between authority and citizens.
For more than 30 years in the Office, some important projects have been collected, which watchers look back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the construction office and his employees.
But in the future, there are also various projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla Areal and the Lowerhofen Parkplatz has been underway.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadiumanation is still topic.
Only the latter will be hit with about 1.5 million euros to books, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in everything, great tasks are waiting for my follower.
The work here is fun."
Design is available for a city tree champion with a large space of play.
Haslach's own farm and gardening can be reacted to many things quite flexible.
"You can move a lot," so Wacker, and the design of green plants is often mentioned praising by citizens and visitors.
Since the old city is under monumental protection, it is important to have "a eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the divorcing city tree champion emphasizes.
Without prejudice, the city champion has high responsibility.
He's a builder, "at the end everything goes over my table."
In the case of care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been present for ten years, Manfred Schöner (deep construction) for 15 years.
Also, that his follower remains long, Wacker wants: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job."
Continuity is not only important for a good operating environment, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, according to the city of Haslach, you should be able to present a completed study as a diplomatian or bachelor with a specialist architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction regulation and planning.
The city building office is supported by high and deep construction, construction management, basic acquisition, management of urban properties, urban holding with building and city garden, and lower construction right authority including monumental protection.
Cycle thrown on lines: South trail locked
According to the police, the unknown actors had thrown the blue bike from the railway transfer in the field of Leoben Road (B116) on the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the nearby carriage of goods had to be stopped.
The investigators have gone from two male actors and have been looking for them since the night hours.
A pink-red wheeler and bicycle rider had been observed near the site.
"That goes far beyond a louben area," said ÖBB-speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The person or the actors would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the installation, and the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement, the railway customers could also come to the operators.
Overall, the speaker said, would be going out of a "heavy" sum.
The damage was recovered on Friday afternoon, the railways on the southern railroad could be managed without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had expired on Friday, two of which were related to remote transport.
Trains did not fall out, but they had delays.
According to ÖBB-speaker Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of top lines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to facilitate IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestion system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could facilitate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal disease.
The unhealable state of approximately 1.3 million in the United States and about 300 000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach forces and bleedings, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While the affected are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products in order to facilitate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide into food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harmful tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory intestinal disease.
In experiments, an immune cell that promotes tolerance has been identified in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their invasive tissues.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan, one of the building stones of proteins, to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have made a connection between a bacteria species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan had the mouse in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich diet in tryptophan promotes more tolerable, less inflammable darmmily if the same system works in humans.
The post-physician Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mices had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separately placed, had not.
She suspected that the difference was related to the intestinal microbioms of the mouse - the community of bacteria, viruses and sulphurs, usually living in the stomach darm traction.
The drums of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacteria species were found in the mice with the immune cells but without them were missing in the mice.
Mouse was raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked a darm microbiom and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand the impact of the bacteria on the immune system, the researchers reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to unreif immune cells that were isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance stimulating cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be an adjacent product of tryptophane metabolism known as indol-3-milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mouse, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the levels of tryptophane were halved, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-producering cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach darm tractors.
It is not known whether tryptophan nephew products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially high tryptophane levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a genius
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a genius, Jose Mourinho believes, after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea signature began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-saison game, before the UEFA Supercup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder roll, when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira formed popular.
However, Matic had been excluded from the Blues Preparation-Asia tour and only 45 minutes achieved what Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the League League season.
"He takes time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready earlier than later."
Besides Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva Stadium, when Mourinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wished three more new commitments, but he claimed that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfil three of his four priority new obligations.
"To get three of four, I thank the association for it," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have given great effort."
Boeing Paint Dreamliner in heaven
The US Aircraft Manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in heaven.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the U.S. State of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. State Michigan and moved over the United States in the form of a Dreamliner, which is several thousand miles.
The action took 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner.
The whole was a persistent test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertising before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in heaven.
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD-Chef, Social-Democratic Prime Ministers always looked for elections with some concern to Berlin.
The most important wish of the electoral warriors was that of no murder from the party centre, only no counterwind from the covenant.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees from the Willy-Brandt House have seen the events in the SPD-regulated national capitals with growing disturbance.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year, is not even described with counterwind.
It was deep beats.
And one after another.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPDs and Greens.
"This shows once more: Red Green can't rule reliably," said CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber to the redaction network Germany (RND).
The surprising outturn of a Green Member's group has crashed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the country-day election, his red-green coalition lost its one-voting majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Business Director Michael Kellner has invited the deceitful Dutch Green Member Every Twest to return their mandate.
Transmission to the CDU means a clear falsification of the electoral will.
Each Twest has to return its mandate immediately," said the Federal Business Manager and the Greens election fighter to the RedactionsNetwerk Deutschland (RND).
"It mustn't be all this true," sucks a SPD fighter, when the new Jobs message reaches the party centre on Friday.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the transmission of the Green Member Every Twest to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD countries.
And nobody knows what's next.
The Miser began with the unexpected significant defeat at the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed down the companions of the time.
After the country-day elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westfalen, everything will be different.
It also became - and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite slept the party smoothly.
Compassionately, the companions reappeared in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next depth hit.
Citizen Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of the country, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmony while burning his city.
And because in the crisis communication afterwards he made quite everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has struggled for his political survival.
So now, Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW-abgas business and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister was already in criticism for a long time.
Mixed survey values were added.
Yet, or maybe just why, because in the past weeks, more and more tried to put in the federal accent.
The attempt of the former Mayor of Hannover to strengthen his power in Berlin was also not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz.
They granted him because they promised because a stabilisation of the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
This is because there is in principle no blame on the party-internal twist of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz didn't.
In fact, the partners are trying to keep their own series closed.
Their wrath is focused on the greens, and above all on the deceitful parliamentary parliamentarian Twest.
"It is indispensable and democratic, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, Head of the Partial Links in the SPD Federal Group, the RedactionsNetwork Germany (RND).
Ms Twesten has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person, but on the list of the Dutch Greens, the Dutch Member continued.
The logical consequence would be that she returned her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Head of the SPD Federal Group, complains about a "undemokratic manöver".
"The voter's will was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan because they were Prime Minister," says Uppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate to the Federal Day election, the RND.
"Now, the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the result of elections," Supreme continued.
He asked to explain the backgrounds.
I want to know if there was more or if there were further commitments from the CDU Low Saxony.
Funds for local core III
Whoever wants to be a house in the years to be renovated can soon receive support from the country.
Bürgermeister Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG City Development on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look at what happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been renewal areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding sum.
However, the grant was 60 per cent in the rehabilitation zone II from 2005 to 2016.
For Schindlers, the previous renewals are a "successful" project - it is ultimately important to promote internal development and not only to create new building areas.
On April 4th, the Karlsruhe Government Bureau received the information that there will be a renovation area III.
The sum of the funds is EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 from the country, the rest from the community of Empfingen.
How does a restructuring area arise?
As Schindler continues, you will investigate where the "truely old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area.
If appropriate, the territorial limits could also be moved again.
The STEG represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the content of the Federal Country Programme "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of interior cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be subject to objects, i.e. per land.
The restructuring area would then be defined as a statute.
The grant period for the funds shall continue until 30 April 2026 from 1 January 2017.
However, until September this year, the inventory would only be carried out, in the context of which the stakeholders in the renovation area have a questionnaire to fill in.
In November or December, the statutory decision is to be taken, as far as possible, so that the renewals can be started in the next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing urban misconducts and deciding when and to what extent it is renewed.
A restructuring note will then be recorded in the basic book for each land.
Pietzschmann will come back to Empfingen and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a major success factor for the project was the participation of stakeholders.
Therefore there will be questionnaires that will be postponed to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled up until the end of summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and landbourg", which includes the building condition and the renovation plans.
In the grey questionnaire, the "budget and housing book", information on size, division and inhabitants of a living room can be made.
The blue "business map" is only to be filled in if business spaces are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding.
In addition, reconstruction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds is functioning after the "Windhund Principle" - who comes first, is first.
You can't reserve funds for later "reservation".
At the end of the project, photos of the "Local II" were shown to make the present a "pleasant" recovery.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get in the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the small chip between thumbs and show fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through its company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, in order to ensure that the implantation procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, everything for a price of £ 300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology that begins when his hand is on control.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The decision of the White House to fly a marine helicopter to the South Law for an event that highlights the US production last month, costs taxpayers according to the information of the military handed over to the TIME magazine up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heartpiece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Vice-President of the White House, made a tour through products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine, a fire-car from Wisconsin and a Mississippi forgetable.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, nearly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Law, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event of high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the evening of the event to his commander, the vice-president of the Marine Commander for Aviation.
The message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Law on 17 July at 7:00 p.m. for the event at 15 p.m., and remained until the racing was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours, a second crew would be required for return flight.
The original flight crew was in the event at the helicopter, while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground at the plane during the time.
From the records provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was needed.
The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could injure the destination.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"It sounds like you're closed," replied the vice-president.
The "Made in America" event was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political upper tones.
At the event, the President incited the reform of the health reform that was ongoing at the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to reduce governmental legislation.
The use of the plane known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But demand their use only for a photo-OP, is unusual.
Trump carried out an investigation in February when the President's plane was carrying out taxi services in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the President's plane by its predecessors.
"The White House is enthusiastic with the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters, Vice-President of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Law to dispose of the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimeter sets.
When Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 carried out 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event was among the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units fly 11 hours on this day for non-presidentship support missions.
The White House said that the taxpayers took the burden for none of the other requisites presented at the event.
A speaker of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in postponing the helicopter on the South Law.
HMX-1 does not hold budget records for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event.
However, according to the hourly rates of the US Defence Ministry for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for VH-3D is USD 24.380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit indicate the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
"Defining the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to an RAND study from 2015, the refund rates for DoD do not contain the staff costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At that time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people, are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tiredly.
It is of course appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his round over the South Law for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tough task
Top rides of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga join the table third Searchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will enter Kiel at the table third Searchsdorfer SV tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Despite five parties, the top rider of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga has still received the sense of reality.
In any case, team manager Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Just on the back positions I like the crew very well."
For class and stability at the Searchsdorfer SV, imports from the high north are mainly provided.
"There Danes and Finns can even refer to efforts in the Davis cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"This becomes difficult for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The newer team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the challenger-turnier in the Italian Biella active franchise does not make it to the Bundesliga-Party, the Zdenek Kolar, who is currently playing in the Czech Liberec tournament, comes to his first use in this season.
The chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo, who has not been defeated until yesterday, was at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball with the White Rouss Andrei Vasilevski.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandsc aid, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at Alster, Máté Valkusz could go back to the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was the number one of the Junior World rankings in January 2016, someone from the trainer stack around Marius Zay fills up the frame.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not act happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law on the reinforcement of sanctions against Russia.
"In his urgency to adopt the law," the Congress packed up a few "constitutional rules", he eated.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels shudded against the US prosecution.
Indeed, the draft proposes to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines in the EU.
As a matter of concern, investors of the local OMV, who together with other European companies have financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Guide Nord Stream 2.
The Drohkulisses are huge.
However, it would be too early for an assessment of the consequences, so the official statement of the oil group.
Indeed, Donald Trump would have to raise the penalties to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are his choice.
"The Press" has seen what the group could defend and who could really hurt him.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is placed in the hit series of Netflix
Despite the second pile of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix is not over for a long time.
The three and four stakes were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evil weights of the show.
With the third pile, DEA has focused on the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Cali cartel.
Introduced by four powerful patents, they operate "as a fortune-500 business" only with more government mutations and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the map, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is their head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type who invites American and Colombian criminal persecution authorities to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third pile of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Role Backward: The city sets 46 kitchen aids
The city reorganizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With firm contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city's children's daily places.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over food supply in the city's children's day facilities (Kitas) in its own region.
For Sonja Pommeranz, vice-president in the Youth Assistance Section, this is a good news: "We all have been very pleased."
Continue boiling outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and delivers fresh boiling cooled on.
The city operates in the Krefeld area of 46 children's days, in 44 the children get a warm meal for lunch.
In the last year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables each, and the need grows steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 weeks eat in Kita at lunch," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care, if children stay up to 14 o'clock."
46 part-time forces have a cuisine service from 1 September: they warm the food supplied, supplement them around salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, publish the food, clean, wash and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two grouping as well as seven-group facilities - decides over the time range.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"They are much more integrated and it is easier for the cita-direction to implement educational concepts."
For it is also about healthy diet and cooking.
"The kids are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the cuisine force to the team is useful.
For the kids too.
"They have a well-known power in Kita, a person that is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - as well as the task of the cuisine forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - also has the charm that it has shown to be the most economic in terms of cost comparison between self-regio and foreign supply for the city, says the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are re-enforced.
"But these hours do not fall in weight in about 750 people in education," says Sonja Pommeranz.
The Afghan Democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN.
Elections can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, said the Head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, Managing Director of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the Council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate unlimitedly and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the Province Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has published threats to a electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international fighting acts to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time the elections will be given the power peacefully from a democraticly elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will further strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan independent election Commission reports that 1.2 million women from totally registered 3.6 million voters are registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to the police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends at the Colping Street at 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
But the 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends.
Thereafter one of the actors tried to grab the girl's cell phone and necklace, but it was too long.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigations are ongoing.
GMB concerns investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to ensure by managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie the long-term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company swooped about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees are working in the work that produces hubnobs and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be "experienced first" if their activities would change.
In a letter to the company's branch leader, GMB urged Scotland McVitie's to say "a concern that funding for modernising production lines is not being advanced".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager on business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply.
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force has focused strongly on the local community and the large glassgow area, an important pillar for human employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and the background of the Brexit, the increasing cost of living and the chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a florating production presence at McVitie."
One speaker of Pladis said: "The branch leader at Tollcross received only yesterday a letter from GMB Scotland, and the company will respond directly to it because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade unions representatives.
We had a regular meeting two months ago with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, are constantly checking our businesses - and that is true of all our business areas and sites - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our rabies location, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the inheritance of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this."
Has the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago before Neymar?
The side of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not leave in her persecution by Neymar after she has made an offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record to break more than the double of the previous brand, where Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world's highest-paid professional player. PSG offers wages of more than 5000,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board is insisting that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president against this view?
When Manchester City 2014 showed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning to every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to let one of our players sign with themselves, this will have the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG middle field player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for Neymar.
Roller wrapped and damaged
In the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown actor has deliberately destroyed a roller placed in the king's field road before the property number 30 and thus arranged for the closure of the vehicle damages of more than 200 euros.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422/27 01-0, ask for instructions.
For an accident on the B 215 between pride and reading, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car arrived at him on his driving track, the driver of a VW Touran had to wake out and touch the guide plank.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau on the way to read.
In the area of the local surrounding of Stolzenau, a car came to meet him on his driving track, so he had to go to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guide plank.
In the car there were damages.
The driver of the counterpart car, a Mercedes Benz, had overlaped a truck and continued his drive without taking care of the traffic accident.
It may be good, according to the accident damaged, that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: 'Domspatzen report discharged Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger'
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases discharges Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse candal of the Regensburg Judges continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are Church", explained after publication to the German Press Agency, he was expecting a excuse from the former rainburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Judge Chapel Champion Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI..
It would be very helpful to view the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regrets about their own submissions or their false assessment of the transactions at that time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized the fact that the report on violence in the court patches is measured by "two dimensions".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but notefully the "Grad Media Manipulation", says the author Luceta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to think that is normal," writes Scaraffia.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bayerian broadcast: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth it had been "a very normal educational means", "to get ready with freaking children, like I was one."
It finds it unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Incorrectly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorial band "My brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all that had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report that the lawyer responsible for informing by Bistum Regensburg has presented Ulrich Weber?
A total of 547 Regensburg Judges were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plausibility" victims of violations, 67 jurisdictions.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "As a summary, then it can be found that the forms of physical and psychological violence were applied by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases.
Just in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be more severe.
In contrast to many other accused ones, however, it is noted that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases despite violence, even connect positive memories with him."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal of the Regensburg Judges Georg Ratzinger considers it to be discharged.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidence of violence exercised by protective commands at the Regenburg Judges", gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
Firstly, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he appears as a cholerist and perfectionist, who became handsome to the upper, when a domspatz did not bring a top performance musically.
How did you appreciate this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the efforts and read the entire 440 pages of the report from front to back, you have to ask you, why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it.
He is just devoted to eight pages, and he is clearly released from any suspicion of meditation or conscientience in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the pre-school also took place outside its scope of action.
In any case, it can be pretended to know about it too late or to have not taken the first indications seriously enough.
The domspatzengymnasium, on which he acted, was found by virtually all the respondents as - so literally - "Resurrection", "Himmel" and "better world".
The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent witness, describes him as "warmhearted", "popular", "true", "competent" and "conscious", as a very good-minded teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cooks and bonuses and "all the grapes of children."
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has led to rage.
That he was not only crushed with chairs and threw the key bundle on the ground, but also scattered earfish and all too freaky boys on the hair or ears, he confessed himself years ago, deeply regreted and excused himself for it.
However, to his honorable salvation, it must be said that such education methods were widespread in the relevant period, the 1960s and 1970s, in parents as in teachers.
Do you even remember such discipline methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a worldly school, a state school.
Compared to what it is actually about in this report, namely the absurd sexual abuse and the excess of violence at the pre-school, it is freely a bagatell.
You are wondering whether it is not rather about his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI. that many media just crashed on him.
Many people who have never understood it are still working zealously off the Bayerian Pope.
The truth is, however, that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every way!
The media reported a lot about the issue of abuse in the Regenburg Judges in connection with the report.
Does Georg Ratzinger in the final report also put any development or companionship in terms of sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claimed to have entrusted to the dome champion.
Not even the parents were devoted.
"I never trusted in talking to my father or mother about it," said one interested representative to the others, "It was all very embarrassing."
The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was, and it is, however, that most victims are silent.
If they did not even confide in parents and sisters, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the actors in the profession.
How, then, are the judges' schools Ratzinger's role in the abuse?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed student formulated it as follows: "In terms of sexual abuse ... I see no ... in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had been explored in time and could have stopped the respective actors.
I think it is ... also truly absurd to assume that it has been computed to him ... bubbles have made more incremental or clear or even more open than to their parents, internal leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear result: "The fact that students concerned and/or their environment could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."
So as to sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak from any companionship.
In this way, he cannot be conceived to prevent him or have brought him to display.
Therefore, there is no reason for bringing his good name into connection with these contradictory crimes, as it happened in some cases unfortunately.
In the media, a lot of "vocational excesses" were read at the Regenburg Judges.
The former Judge Champion Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this contempt?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the reporting, everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excess of violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.
But this is, on the other hand, a misuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the university of the courts, between sexual abuse and excess of violence and, we say, other claims.
In addition, the report deals with events from the time since 1945, also from four decades where Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the courts.
The whole terrible prudent education, the cases in which boys were regularly chicaned and mistreated by sadist teachers and suffered disgusting among them, all occurred at the preschool in Nazhausen and Pilenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have dominated.
However, Judge Chapelmester Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he got the boys to face only when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that was, as the most witnesses emphasised, the topic "preschool" tabu.
You were just happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What else was there on the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this is true of Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even positive reminders with him in spite of violence."
That's how the punishment remains to have looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could define only two periods in which the conditions at the pre-school were reported.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just began to set up and from the courses at a school where he was just not working and responsible, (as the Witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then only again at 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger close the ears consistently before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, for in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Judgmentgymnasium, which even reproduces the report.
In this, he pointed out that "the penalty is still practised in the pre-school".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent entry.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when penalties were banned in Bayern too long.
Before that, they happened in a lawful grey zone, as every one of us may know.
There was also a difficult estimate for him, where the affected people may have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit has really been exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
Only in 1980, the school penalty was officially abolished in Bayern.
President Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time of that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about "the case of anachronism", the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards.
That's where the prince is right.
Of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was awful at all times and not to what has been broken in the preschool of opposition and violence on innocent children’s seals, which is far beyond the usual at that time.
It's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all that had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishment, i.e. to draw earfish and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was banned, he also strictly followed it.
What picture of his rainburger time did Georg Ratzinger have in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the topic of punishment also come to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, where the courts played only a side role.
Yet, I didn't say that he was conducting a strict regime there.
But this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without demanding essential discipline, it would have been hardly possible for him to form a world-ranging institution from the more well-known national rainburgers, the true cultural messages of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tours twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and bonuss alone, you're not making a big singer and standing before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger in the conversations with her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and repeatedly experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep believers and heartbearing people, from whom you can't imagine that he could suffer anything but a fly.
I get regularly with how many former courts still today, 23 years after his emeritation, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.
So those who do not forgive him that he once was strict to them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the courts are thankful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good father's teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but he was also a loving respect person to whom they are still watching up today and who are just honoring them.
And please, once again, quite clear: all that is being conceived to him is educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time forever.
But it's very unfair, a man, only because he's prominent and has a prominent brother to make a media sins bock.
There is the evil intention behind it, only too obvious.
For the report, which has just been published, discharges him.
Now, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great earnings and without the outside of Bayern and perhaps Germany's, no one would probably know the Regenburg Judges at last in peace.
