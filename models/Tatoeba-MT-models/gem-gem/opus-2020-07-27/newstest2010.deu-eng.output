Barack Obama receives the peace nobel price as the fourth president of the US
The American President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to accept the peace nobel price here as the fourth president of the US in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The Chief of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who chose him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
The President's couple planned a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its highlight with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the Prestige Prize.
He receives this as the fourth president of the US, but only as the third one who receives the price directly in the office.
The White House has already revealed that Obama will speak about the Afghanistan war when he takes the price.
The President does not want to waive this topic because he knows that he accepts the price as a president who is currently leading war in two countries.
He has strengthened the efforts of war a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the goldmedal, diploma and check over ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to spend for good purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific qualitative work.
The event programme then provides a bankett with the President and his wife, where, except Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 charged guests will be present.
Obama was very reluctant from the beginning to the price.
He suggested, for example, that he feels that he doesn't deserve the price completely.
He also repeated several times that it is not only the price for him, especially for those seeking the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he suggested that this is "invitation to action" for him.
Natural protectors are accused of the depression
The Leitmeritz politics accused the Chairman of the Civil Association "Natural Protection Society Leitmeritz" for depression.
In several cases, he invoked appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his professions, he called for money from the investors for his benefit, said the Leitmeritz Police Speaker, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz Natural Protection Community Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and it threatens him a prison penalty of up to three years.
The sort garbage containers in Brünn do not smell well
In Prague, people can sort the drink packs, in the Southern villages you will find the sorting waste containers again.
And in Brünn?
There you need to reserve for a few minutes to find the suitable waste tones.
I don't want to claim that the separation of waste in Brünn would not work at all.
But I find it insufficient whether the Councillords care for this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste-distribution in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics, but especially through the number of waste tonnes for such waste.
Have they ever tried in the centre to dispose of the PET bottles in a collective basket for example?
This is just art, before all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far is the piercing place toward the stranger Gans.
Mr Underka is not to be angry with his colleagues, but that is too little for me.
Besides that the separation of waste is not an honey sludge in other parts.
Therefore, whole series of my friends do not prefer to sort the waste.
From faulness.
It is too far to them to the garbage tones.
I'm not surprised.
Even after the celebration, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova Street, I haven't seen any colour garbage tones in view.
Fortunately, I came to the right place when I drove the roadway.
But the waste was almost over.
This is still the center of Brünn, which represents the whole city, right?!
However, ecology and any form of aesthetics are likely to make the Brünner socialists cold.
Instead of buying some more waste tons and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brown.
I am pleased that I could confirm my assumption with official statistics after I was looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the ECO-COM company, Brünn is really the worst in the entire district of southern marrow.
The "Paroubek" budget has taken the money for pensions and healthcare money
After the left party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no more money available in the budget for pensions, healthcare and building savings.
But not for the government debt interest rates or for the international judicial disputes.
This causes even more problems that will be on the government in the second half of the next year, says Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the socialists and Communists made the increase in wages for some groups, they expected that the government would additionally borrow the money for the sensitive expenditure, pensions or healthcare. "This is just a suspension of the problems in the future, mineing," says Janota.
From the loans, the interests are relatively higher and the money must be reimbursed at some point.
Too much to choose where to take, the state fund is empty.
If the social benefits or costs of the state operation are not reduced, taxes shall be increased.
For all those who the left party now gave more money: the firearm, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
For the pensions or the healthcare money from whose account has disappeared 1.8 billion, people don't have to be afraid of getting this money.
But at the price that the state is guilty more - the next year, the State Bank will not only miss 163 billion but much more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota, the debt will increase as faster as well as the costs and interests, together with them.
The State will need the money for compensation, then it will not be enough to increase VAT only slightly or to shorten the maternity money, as the government did in its counterdeficit package.
As a result of the defeat of money to some electoral population groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
It is mainly the sections obtained in competition that can no longer be reproduced and possibly approve.
At least get what is not free.
This means delay or setting up of thirty large buildings, endangered is also the European money creation, warns the speaker of the Transport Ministry, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it dissolve the flow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ shares with which the State is owner of the Majority, and then the money will be emitted into the transport funds.
The problem is that the level of the dividend is never safe and it is no longer an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion CEZ flowed from the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, fill the pension account, and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
In addition, this trick increases the actual budget deficit by EU rules to the Nieveau of 5.7 per cent GDP.
But this does not end the carneval of the transformations yet.
Nearly three billion fell the budget for various compensation for victims of Communism and crimes or for expenses for the judicial disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the State can handle without that money is not sure.
That's a pure gambling.
If we lose an international judicial dispute, we have to pay it anyway, Janota makes it clear.
The minister will then have to save the money inside or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing for the two-million-year-old project "statskasse", which is intended to allow the monitoring of on-line, for which the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Ministry of Finance did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans expect the future with a mobile phone that the user can switch by pressing a single key between different operating systems.
The plans presented are promising.
It is enough to just press one key, and from Windows Mobile will be in few seconds in the change of Android.
This is exactly what the American company wants to imagine VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on the mobile phone.
You can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and working profiles.
Both will work parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti indicated by the company VMware at the interview for the Magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be marketed in 2012.
Virtualization of the smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully carried out the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which parallelly the above-mentioned systems run Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full.
Now the company VMware works with the European and American operators at the smartphone virtualization and to the customer, the devices are intended to come within 2012.
Snow deficiency on the mountains causing the hotel owners
Scneeless pists are not only worried about the giant mountain residents.
The missing snow also shocks people from ordering the ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, in Giant Mountains you can still receive free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and silvester.
Our sites are often visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether we think that this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on match", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
If anyone wants the silvester stay in the spindle wheel exactly according to his ideas, no longer should hesitate with the order.
Who prefers the saving and when the quality of the stay comes to second place, he can try to wait a few days.
In the meantime, the spindle mill owners offer only weekly stays for the silvester day.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they must also give up, and go on shorter times.
And then the free rooms will swiftly disappear, Jandura appreciated.
Free beds at all winter dates always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now most of us are interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Silvester Day in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi travel agency, but there are fewer free spaces here.
Good paragraph also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is no snow in giant mountains.
People wait for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the pists are cut off within a week, the Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Reversely and something better than last year it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizon in Pecpod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better than the previous year.
On the silver day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also be well running, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80 percent for the silvester stay, the Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, half of the beds remain free.
Pleasantly, we were surprised this year of January, for which we are already occupied by about 60 percent at the moment.
A little weaker is in the meantime of February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains is certainly rising, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
In the meantime, the giant mountain hotel owners are waiting for a larger snow shaving.
On Thursday it should cool off and if rainfall occurs, it should be on the mountains of snow.
But afterwards, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
United States: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It is almost funny with which student pursuit Barack Obama, the President, with his reputation of the smartest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question he himself considered to be the most dumb.
When he finally swept out his desired Afghanistan doctrine, it showed that he wrote it about the copy paper from the Busch-Irak scenario three years ago.
Not only that he used the speaking type "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forward path" without harassing.
He himself criticized the Bush idea - fresh troop quotas to the Iraq plagued by the civil war - as "unresponsible and in its succession of a karastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on the recommendations of the military was the only possible and so far very successful that today's news about Iraq no longer speaks.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, because objectively he left his follower a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat.
In order to increase the troop quota, he again asked the military, especially the commander of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite the subordination habits, severely criticized the devastating protectors in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation to better.
The President hesitated three months, but has not come to a better idea, and so he has betrayed the general about 10 000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the commitment for another 5,000, even though he initially calculated at least 10 000.
The highest problem in the entire Obama strategy is his project to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that half-up will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war in recent years, the Iraq society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication - no one can rely on anyone and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally correctly founded, remain only clarity buildings that will continue to grow behind the patriarchal family relationships.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the untransparentity of the situations that further complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "dealtable state", which is the minimalistic objective of the entire operation.
Time horizon of the Obama Strategy promoted by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened further and is now at the edge of the explosion.
It believes that the small soldiers who broke out in the war cry about the "Frühheimkehr" can create a miracle here, only a real romantic soul that is not impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the deduction of the troops is purely unreliable, because the Taliban will take this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans’ willingness to participate in the fights in Afghanistan is a naked point.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain their electorates how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hinduchus hillland.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem is not to be solved by troops.
This question must be answered during the period in which America goes to Obama to the victorial departure from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will also mean a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only comforter for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential election, and thus it remains enough time to take another strategy, it would be a total failure.
The managers of the Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive premium bonuses in bar
The leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs are no longer in bar this year.
This announced the company who responds to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of money, but they may only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the case if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, is at the top of the efforts to connect the Wall Street premium with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the JPM organ, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made himself the target disc of criticism after she had set up for the first three quarters of this year almost $17 billion for premium bonus.
The total amount of the premium bonus during this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, even despite the measure presented today, according to the Reuters Agency.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hotest political issue at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, the UK reported that it intends to charge the banks' bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps are also prepared for France.
This year women have won the Nobel Prizes in all departments, except in physics.
Today, five record women in Stockholm have taken over the Nobel Nobel Prizes from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf in the field categories and for literature.
In addition to the four scientists, Herta Müller, was among the German writer of Romania.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostak for research in the chromoson area.
The price for chemistry has been given to the Israelite Ada Jonath, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for information about the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin forgave the Nobel Prize for Economy that the American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which there was no Nobel Prize in this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao have taken this price away for research in the glass fibre area and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these prizeholders has received the diploma, the Nobel Medail and the certificate of the acquisition of the money price.
There are ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several priceholders in each category, the money price is divided into them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has received the most expected peace nobel price in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech he recognized the controversys of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his way and also at the top of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
However, in respect of his policy, he added that in certain situations wars are necessary for fighting world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers the withdrawal. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus received on Friday early the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who thinks of his remaining in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form that was released by the parliamentary assembly on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the subjects of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the ethical deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President's speaker, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
On Monday, Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, which now receives Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should finance with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, however, Parliament voted on the left-party proposals for the conversion of money and increased the money for the government employees, for the maintenance of the social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to increase the budget deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the judicial party on the other side, there has been a sharp internal political dispute, for which the question mark arises about the further work of the Fisherman Officer Cabinet on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Criticians claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of savings measures which have been implemented by the fishermen government in the autumn, and which, in their understanding, will end the government debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to do so today, at the time of discussion with the entrepreneurs, explained that politicians have neglected the "reasonable problem", which is the "invaluable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
He believes that there is no good solution today.
Improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on a broader consensus between political parties.
The ODS Chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is cruel and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, said to the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with support for the CSSD, ODS and Green Party is no longer working.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial edition as "stark expressions".
The CSSD Chief, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to the Topolanek words that the etat deficit was cruel that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The people's party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unmarried" of the world shows a lot of the country, of its struggle and victory despite some criticisms, that the main role was occupied by an American actress.
The story tells about sports, racial relations and Nelson Mandela.
The unremoved fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents the American Oscar actors, Morgan Freeman, in his life story.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood film.
Another significant role Matt Damon takes over.
I told him, "If I'm gonna play you, I have to meet you.
The two and seventy-year-old actress, who had received the price for his role in Eastwood-Drama from the "Million Dollar Baby" box area, already represented the leader of the movement to abolish the slavery, from which the end of which has become a slave holder, a fictional president of the United States, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely someone who is still alive and is as important for many people as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was in prison for his active activity at the end of the apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The demand was how to speak
The film describes a true event where Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to agree the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people remains still race-shaped and economically divided by apartheid.
He believes that he can agree his people through sports, so he decides to agree with the rugby players that belong to the outsides worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role as close to this reality as possible, said Freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak as he did.
The actress said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat with him at evening and be behind his speech.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand.
I've found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it's being transferred, and I felt that I know what you feel, he said.
It's important for me to have become another person.
Matt Damon represents the film François Pienaar, captain of the National Rugbyteam, in which the white players have considered it.
The actress said he had six months of time to prepare for the role in the hard backby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I ringed to the door ring that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the obvious differences in the statue of the actors compared to their actual models, he received positive reviews under the leadership of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good story, very well-exert film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret over Norway: The Russians tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed about Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence granted only yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic rocket was tested near the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful again and the rocket called "Bulava", which originally should be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian Generality as well as the premier, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on the spot at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the sample flights.
Bulava has usually not been started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, one already writes about "Bulava" as a "raket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights
This already 13th attempt, was normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight, technical damage has occurred on the rocket.
The engine probably exploded at the third rocket level.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atom-U-Boot Dmitrij Donski, which drove under the water of the White Sea.
This type of missile enables the shot from the U-boat.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over north is actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian rocket.
Generality has maintained itself this time and claims that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the third stage was only affected by accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged at the first stage.
Even if no test start was done without error, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen non-successful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism, and it is continued to claim that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even bear up to ten hypersound bombing heads with a total weight of not more than 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at 51 years of age
The legendary defense player Vjaceslav Fetisov represents himself in a professional-eishockey game at 51 years of age.
The former world champion, Olympian and Stanley Cup -owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in disaster, and is probably already in the Friday KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career with forty years, in 1998, is at the time President of the CSKA.
After Denis Kulias was injured, we urgently need another defense player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the Agency AP quoted the Coach of the Moscow Club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous Eishockey player will only affect one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of these who can raise the morality of other players, leader Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional eishockey game according to AP.
In the NHL, the legendary Stormer Gordie Howe has played a whole season for Hartford in a fifty-fifty years and has been able to reap 15 meetings and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful Eishockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic Gold Medals, seven World Championship titles, and he also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup over his head twice in the Detroit dress.
He has been a member of the Eishockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai surrendered the trade unions. All overtimes are cancelled
The management of the Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai agreed with the trade union on the cancellation of all overtimes.
Due to frequently arranged overtime, the trade union announced the stressfulness on Monday.
This confirmed the speaker of the automobile factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wishes to agree with the trade unions on one Saturday story this week.
We must not give up our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtimes were proposed for the reason that two working layers would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday layer.
The employees also receive them in the afternoon for the Saturday layer of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtimes.
Either they can pay the overtime supplement or they can take replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Mr Vanek stated.
In addition, all staff of the Saturday layer will be paid the ride money and lunch.
In view of the fact that overtimes were the most urgent and burning point in terms of claims and complaints of traders who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtimes for December.
The employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work 2 overtimes nearly every day after the eighth-hour team.
The subscription of the agreement will revoke the voluntaryness of the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions are to be held on Friday afternoon.
On Wednesday, the trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said that if they can sign on the fulfilment of the demands and sign a common document, they are willing to cancel the stress willingness.
The location in the automotive factory was conceived last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously struggled for constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and alleged misconducts.
The management argued that the employees had to make overtimes to comply with the automotive supply needs.
The trade unions also requested in their Monday Strategy Committee that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday do not have any penalties.
In the area of overtime, trade unions demand to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they demand the payment of 5000 kroner in this year.
The Nosovice automotive factory Hyundai now busy 2000 people.
Series production was started in November last year in the company.
Until September, around 80 000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200 000 vehicles per year.
Czech Discovery: a substance that also works with ‘stalled’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new connections to stop the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to medicines.
This fact overweighs the disadvantage that the compound on normal virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the already existing medicinal products.
AIDS disease cannot be cured yet.
The patient can, however, prolong the composition of medicines and prevent the increase in HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus increases also result in development of resistant viruses against which no medicinal products are more effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, of the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
You have shown that the substances referred to as metalokarborane have an effect on the protein responsible for the increase in the HIV virus.
The Metalokarborans are compounds of drill, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus growth in other ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists arrive in new improved compounds that were prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
The metalokarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-famous cages consisting of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are combined by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Heavy and persistent virus
HIV protease is an HIV virus protein that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease splitting, there would be no mature virus particles.
If we disable the HIV protease, we also disable the increase of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report, published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of connections in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effects of this series of substances against HIV protease are tested in the reagent glass, including their persistent (resistant) variants obtained by HIV infected patients.
The effect of Metalokarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicinal products, but does not lose its effect on the resistance variants which are often ineffective against the medicines used.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its further characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, makes the Metalokarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective anti-HIV medicinal products, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Structural Biology Laboratory of Institutes for Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of Sciences.
Conflict on behalf of the budget. ODS started on fishermen who fights
The Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for the next year as "great" and the government of Prime Minister of Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The statement of the ODS was referred to as "severe expressions" by the President of the Minister.
It is supposed to be time for the analysis.
The vice-president of ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet with support for the CSSD, ODS and Green Party is no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it is the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it is his remaining in the office by means of parliamentary links.
The approach of ODS and Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrally different, Necas has pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, with Linkpartei amendment proposals over more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for government employees, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of social democracy to increase the budget deficit.
Czech Republic should finance with a remainance of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has fulfilled the government's wish, because the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provision.
Disappointment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a feeling of senselessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has indicated that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened with his withdrawal in the case that the amendments would be adopted, the situation would look different.
According to the Czech television, Janota signed up to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He indicated that he was considering his remaining in the office.
The reason for this is his disappointment of the budget.
To what extent, according to Necas, fishermen are speaking for the further fight with the budget deficit, the nominants of social democracy (CSSD) who had made the changes to the budget have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly that it will be withdrawn if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to healthcare and pensions or the service law.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not fail
This is the case of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not made any mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a U.S. text message.
It mentioned that in some ministries people are sitting in the vice-president function who admit to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decide to avoid fighting the deficit height of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct that they are based on the left majority that is currently in Parliament".
Then he claims not to be able to expect the support and tolerance of citizens' democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if this will be up to date, I will address it, Mr Bartak, nominated Minister of Defence, said to the Journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer fled afternoon at the European Council meeting to Brussels.
The ODS came back on the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS in Parliament would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the members of the citizens' democrats to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear as a bearing children, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not pressed back in the political debate on the budget by the absence of the President of the Party in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice my voice would be missing.
As I abstained from the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, above all, the Bolshewization of Parliament and destruction would be all positive, Topolanek reacted to himself.
After the new timetable of the CD (Czech railway) less trains will be driven for about the same price.
The Czech Railway ends or limits some less loaded fast and local trains from 13 December onwards, while other connections are strengthened.
The total transport volume will be reduced by two per cent from the date of validity of the new driving plan compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. basic and customer driving tariffs are not amended.
For example, several connections to the capital receive the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The quick train will no longer be driven to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Lower speed trains will also be driven on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned for the railways in the Hradec Kralove district (Königsgraz), totally by eight percent, to a rise in Prague and surroundings.
Two night trains are also lifted on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and, on a few days a week, the operation of some fast trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis is reduced.
Among the biggest changes, the introduction of the new direct road from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to travel.
It is the fifteenth road of the Esko suburbs transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electricity of Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - main railway station.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains after Sumpery/Jesenic will run in two hours.
With the Pendolino, the passengers are no longer able to drive to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's account for regional railways: increase by 200 million
The highways are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, totally the railway receives four billion crowns for the next year for the so-called liquidity loss, like this year. The local trains provide the districts, totally pay for it in the next year, eight billion crowns, with the State shooting three billion.
This year, the regional routes are 200 million of the Czech crowns expensive.
For the local and fast trains, the railway has refined a 10-year contract until now, the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps it has not taken to increase the price of the large majority of the licences.
Changes occur only in single-day network licences CD net and in cheap Internet driving licences eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the CD Net price is increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven stick, until now it was united for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Millitantes capture more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante today kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some basic schools and their teachers.
This was indicated by the Agency AFP, which originally informed only over 65 kidnappers.
All 17 children held were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
It was kidnapped in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 millitants claimed to use the hostages as a living sign when fleeing from the police.
The local negotiators are now endeavoring to produce the rest of the hostages.
According to the AFP Agency, the miltants are part of the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded vengeance between the two local family clubs.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the recent massacre, where 57 people were killed, was obliged to stand.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23, which were associated with the election in the Governing Office, were 30 journalists.
Because of the suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this South Philillippinian province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influenceful Ampatuan clan was arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim Separators are also active.
But they reopened peace negotiations with the phillippinian government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinema "Invictus: the Unmarried", which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
Morgan Freeman has received the role of the world's famous fighter against the apartheid, who had been claimed to have been chosen by Mandela a few years ago.
The role of the legendary South African champions in Rugby, Francois Pienaar, received Matt Damon.
With the film's start, the reactions of critics and the public are also loud.
Nelson Mandela
He is named Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakar prize, then in 1993 together with the Clerk the Peace Nobel Prize.
He was elected to the President of the Republic of South Africa in the years 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to the cinema in a time where in South Africa, on the one hand, the preparations for the world championship, while at the same time the media shake the world public with anxiety news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants from the black dominant majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are first and foremost positive, despite many reservations against the occupation of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new movie.
Of this role, I have made many years and I have prepared well for it.
Multiple times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that, as I say, I could receive his energy, he took up the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can learn about Mandela's personality and his message with this movie.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects every man, he supplemented.
In the dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the book template of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the role of the enemy`: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people united portrays the South African human rights prosecutor within its first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two races and for the year and day of each other, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he is also in his role in the South African National Rugbydress to the World Cup field, which then won South Africa.
For entering the racing in the dress, which is almost a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, mainly from the white audience and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may be accomplishing the people to join a single people again, leading the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the excited situation in South Africa improves, that will first show itself.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, such as in recent interviews for the LN of the Rugby-Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The mastership begins on 11 June 2010.
In the louny area, transformators burn for several 10 million crowns
In the morning, the fire broke out at the transformator of the company Ceps in the circuit in the municipality of Vyskov in the louny area.
At the fire, according to the speaker of the district fire force Usti nad Labem, Luke Marvan, took six units.
Originally, the firearm wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is deleted with a mix of water - foam and special waste materials.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformator incursion lock.
No one was injured, the havary did not jeopardise the safety of the management system, according to the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage has been estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will be counted only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new in accordance with Mandatova.
For more than 10 years, Ceps' society has not done anything similar, mistakes such are rare, supplemented it.
The supply of electricity was not interrupted, according to the speaker of the CEZ company for North Bohren, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the Trafostation did not affect the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as a single operator of the management system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformators with which the electrical energy is transferred in distribution system and directional route with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura raises criminal prosecution against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises penalty for blasphemy against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the southern wall district, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice district and the leader of the Olomouc district, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute Inteview in the radiojournal.
The complaint is linked to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some regions.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term agreements with the Czech railway.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take the roses out, while we have only presented the offer over the extent as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway that were completed last week.
That's how nothing remains to us but to fight us.
Due to this blasphemy of the Society Student Agency, Jancura said to the radiojournal.
At the same time, he indicated that he has evidence from all areas that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
We are therefore preparing a complaint for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the investigation of the penalty advertising to continue the Jancura Medial show, which serves him as a free advertising for his society and for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call for further leaders.
I suppose that this issue will also be clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the case of regional rail transport and uses lying and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million crowns in advertising that will point to the disadvantaged step of the district.
He said to the radiojournal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas, and it would continue after the new year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional railways with the Czech railway and had not issued tenders for the order in a high 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such behaviour is lawless and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, Jancura said that he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we do not avoid that we can lose the bus licences.
He imagined himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, said Jancura to the radiojournal today.
Free and voluntary vaccination against pneumococcos
Immigration against pneumococcos changes the habit from January.
It is the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But votes are now reported that the duty vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcos culminate.
The Medicines Institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines to pay health insurance.
Experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Free vaccines for August kids
From January on, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcos, born on August 2, last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Those who have started the vaccination last year or earlier must also pay for further recovery vaccination themselves.
The first vaccine dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcos.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the recent children.
In general, experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses spends 300 000 to 450 000 kroner a year.
However, they save the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the State has spent approximately 500 000 per year for all vaccinations of children.
The obligation vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococs cause mean ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
By Pneumocococcan infections, we die in hospitals each year after study up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the obligation to vaccinate children against pneumococcos was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be duty?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be obligatory for the future.
From January on, it is to be paid and voluntary by the insurance.
That the mandatory vaccination would be better, mentioned for example the Head of the Civil Association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
Its association has long been used for pneumocococco vaccination.
The experts at the international conference at which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have succeeded in doing at least this.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcos.
At this moment we do not consider this at all, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, claims the doctors.
The chairman of the specialist company of practical children’s doctors, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then you could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccines "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine was started as a voluntary," however, Cabrnochova says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococcos from next year.
The vaccination against pneumocococcos is also broken in the fact that it is paid as the first area vaccination by the health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance should spend the money for prevention so that they save for further treatment, Cabrnochova delights.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, there is a concern about the practical children’s doctors relating to the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and the doctors should then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members feared that the insurance could "extend the money from the hospital insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance pays them.
According to the estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40.000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son is involved in "museum thiefstal"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings in the value of $20 million from his father's museum.
According to the police of Pennsylvania, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was attached to 90 paintings in his vehicle.
It says that Frank Frazetta Junior and another man would have used a bagger to enter the museum into the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of shapes such as the Conan of the Barbar and Tarzan.
As the news agency Associated Press reported, the artist stayed at the time of the event in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family feast.
The Agency reported, according to a police edsman's statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all paintings into a camp".
The Agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior did not agree to have granted any permission.
Labour defends ethics and tax increases
Ministers defended the tax increases and expenditure stops reported in the pre-etail report against the criticism of opposition, economy and trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling had given a chance to "squeeze" to show that he meant it seriously with the reduction of the deficit by pushing out the decisions until after the election.
The treasure officer also decided to target workers with low and medium income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social insurance and a 1% capture limit of the 2011 public salary settlements.
Social security
The trade unions, however, have protested that low wages receivers are punished for a recession which they have not caused and warned against the forthcoming "problems".
The increase in social insurance - about 3 billion British pounds per year - has irritated the private economy, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the attention should be given to the economic growth.
The increase limited to those earning more than 20 000 pounds per year will cover about 10 million workers.
SWARPUNCTIONS OF THE EXTERNAL ETAT REPORT
Increase in social insurance by further 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy decreased by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50 % tax on bankers' bonuses
1 per cent increase in the tax on the company for small enterprises rejected
Tax discounts for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of government pensions by 2.5 %
According to the estimates of the treasury, someone with an annual income of £30.000 will be worse by £90 per year and someone with £40.000 per year will be 190 pounds poorer, while a person with £10.000 annual income will be more than 110 pounds.
The ministers said that their objective of half-financing by 2013 meant "tough decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional taxes would be charged by the 5% of the top earners.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms argued that the sketched tax increases and expenditure stops compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone".
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit half and this is essential for the next four years," he informed the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth until the end of the year.
The Labour Party's predictions on future economic growth – which influences the extent of the new debt and the speed of the deficit deficit – were questioned after the treasurer was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to decrease by 4.75% this year - much more than the decrease by 3.5% predicted in April, while the debt would be higher than expected before.
"Forgotten opportunity"
The conservatives, who want to start a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against the Labour 's school crisis', said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that the ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and press "cynically" before difficult decisions until after the election, which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"You didn't say anything important about what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "You had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass by."
"The significant announcements are made only after the choice, whoever wins it."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour persists that schools, hospitals and the police are preserved from future reductions, different from in the proposals of the conservatives, which see the deficit capture more quickly and more coming.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained by tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argues that the plans are "built on sand".
The political editor of BBC, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements, as the above inflation adjustment for some invalid pensions next April, some of the treasurers would suspend the decline of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour persists on providing extra aid if people need them most and that the situation is reviewed again in September 2010.
Hollow Etat
Although the Ministers have not provided food details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public expenditure will only take place on the medium-term basis.
The recognised tax investigation institute said that the figures of the treasurer would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in future also in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only transfers the pain to later," said his leader Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements are made only after the choice whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser to the economic audit firm Deloitte.
"This was only the hollow pre-etat report. The markets recognize that."
The FBI examines "American Citizens' arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI examines the arrest of five reported US citizens due to the suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested at an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab Province, the American Embassy in Pakistan of the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated whether they're the same men who were reported as missing in the last month of the U.S. state of Virginia.
The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be Pakistanic descendants, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a jemenite background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the complaints that are being sent to them and under what circumstances they are held," said Speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI Speaker Katherine Sweet said that the Authority was informed about the arrests and was in connection with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistan authorities to find out their identity and the purpose of their stay there, if it is actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistan Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house that belongs to one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house before and that no charges against the men arrested were lodged.
The news agency Reuters reported that it refused foreign minister Hillary Clinton to comment on the arrests, but she said that the United States must "more work with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported as missing by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "missuses" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization of Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report detailed "missuse pattern" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report indicated that he was struck and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected the earlier criticism of his human rights balance sheet.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedshad, thousands of people were arrested and killed in Iran, resulting in the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Thousands of prison sentences and chargers said that at least five people were condemned to death.
The BBC-Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, some of the abuse claims recognized and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Traffic Institute.
But since then, there has been no more tolerance for criticism from the authorities, said our correspondent.
"Falish confession"
Amnesty International quoted the 26-year-old computer student Ebrahim Mehtari's report, which said he was accused of the "working with Facebook networks" and of the protest against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a wrong confession and was still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, told Amnesty.
The struck presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrations who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape claims, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been held in a container in a prison in Kahrizak with 75 other than eight weeks.
Amnesty recognised that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to examine the disturbances after the elections and the reactions of the government, but Amnesty, the mandate and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow was used to turn a true sign into Bristol into a competition pist.
The captains of this park event attracted 16 half-professional skiers and snowboarders fighting for money prices.
On the top of the hang in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short jumping chain at the beginning of a 100 meters long hang.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said that there was a beautiful look from the top of the hang, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great look with all the lights of the city that glitches below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some of the right talents."
Prices were awarded for the best artistic pieces or tricks performed on the hang.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still her and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time in which Swiss electorate voted for a ban on the construction of Minarette and the concerns about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a founded and well-overlooked report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most so-called European societies — and being integrated.
Some readers will read this new book of admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French do not love headstrokes" (Original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely argumenting study of a dispute that shared and busy the country over another and a half decades, and the effects of them are still to be observed today.
In addition, the newest book offers a more comprehensive and courageous spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in this area.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now offer 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as it calls Bowen "Islamian spaces".
He is a good listener, he gives back discussions between teachers and students about the questions they are most concerned about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a cottage (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim husband?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a zins-oriented banking system to obtain a hypothec?
It is these seemingly profound matters, he claims that they are the daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media are busy.
The author recognises a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizenship in a modern secular society.
You don't have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are mistrustful of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen are mostly disagree with their salafi counterparts – the prosecutors of the purist sinus islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – which today shows a small but influential presence among European Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French policy makers (and the intellectual elite, who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a harder treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to make their historical compromise with secular Republicanism.
He recognises a "degradation of value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you tend to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Most Faithless View of the World
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that she identifies is melting at an alarming speed and takes life with itself, which can not survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have come into the recent open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their chicken waters.
Richard Ellis, a author and Illustrator, signed in "On thin ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural story of the icons of the north, the ice bear.
Immigrated in the complex history and policy of whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of the arktic researchers who have proved themselves in hunting on the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a ice bear as a courageous 14-year-old fermentary to the lake, who struggled only with the gun flask of his muskete, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears, captured when they swimed behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers, were brought into zooes and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 ice bears showed a imagination.
Even today, zoo plants still typically possess a million piece of the lives of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The ice bear in Singapore became very green by the algae that grows in the hollow hair of his pels.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent the survival of the species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the arrival in Greenland and Canada continues where hunters in helicopters and motor-sliding inuits use powerful storm guns to bring their prey to the route.
Ironically, the ice will remain at the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the Scientific Magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packing insight on how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphere scientists nor oceanographs can explain the speed of the changes appropriately.
But this is not a lack of explanation attempts.
The pioneers’ trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century were the first time that the packet was confused.
Under sea boats veerfully in the Cold War the moving grey during the underway.
A useful supplement is satellite measurements and the large range of messing zones to icebergs, but still a lot is achieved by unangry people camping outside the cold.
Anderson looks into the strange, small world of the flu system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by the salt water ranch halls, which are pressed together during the freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little miracles in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice goes, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, we could be."
Marine infantists were among the 6,000 who settled in Arlington Kränze.
The Upper Free De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours with the bus to put a single crane on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other marine infantists, who took the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Peace Court in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they entered.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of over 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to put cranes on the graves of Veteranen in several sections of the Arlington Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate hundreds of graves at the courtyard in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who are taking this trip each year, standing in various cities along the way to perform events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has expanded the event to other states.
This year, volunteers put more than 16,000 cranes on the graves at the Arlington Friedhof, in areas at the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Friedhouse in Arkansas, in the New York Battery Park and at the United Airlines-Flug 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation spent more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said that she took the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a dead professional soldier.
Although your husband is not in Arlington, Hunt said, this is their way to give back something to the victims.
She said that is a small contribution that we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Incorporated in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the widespread racial surfaces and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the first and second world war and Vietnam war as a goal, since they are not visited as often as the newer graves, the organizers.
The mood was joyful, children played and pairs kept on their hands, while wearing the fresh pitch branches to the gray-coming grave stones.
Each round crane was dark green with a small red loop that was attached to the upper part.
The section 60, which is nearby and where most of the veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations spent 1,000 cranes to decorate this section, but the dark atmosphere of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in ice air.
Some read, according to the names measured in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white cards that had been put in the damp mud whose graves had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who forgot bitter tears before her son's grave.
She has driven 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave site of Marine Infraranterie sub-officier David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the U.S. government of Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested a contractor of the U.S. government, selling mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. with a seat in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as the USAID, the US authorities for international development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the United States' Interest Representative in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The specific points of charge have not yet been published, although, under Cuban law, a Cuban national or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything, under the charge of the "hazard".
All so-called conterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Government enemy graffiti and statements are considered to be a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Mr Sánchez has repeatedly requested an authorisation to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the Castro Brothers in Cuba and the Obama government, which sought a "slow" approach to improving relations with the island.
The message of the arrest was first reported on Friday by the New York Times.
The new US policy stresses that the United States will produce a counterfeit when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year; they are used for sending text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited to the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government sites, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
For many websites, access is limited.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting for crimes such as drug smuggling behind grids, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the US Interest Representative in Havanna.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information on arrest.
The arrest and prison are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently produced a hard report on freedom in Cuba with the title "New Castro, the same Cuba", a reference to Raul Castro's office as the leader of the country, who replaced the older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused were very often arrested, sentenced and arrested within one day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries move together for more dialogue willingness.
Pakistanian government representatives reveal the plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aiming to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said that they hope that this case could help to discover a broader network of terrorist advertisers seeking the Internet for radicalized young men.
Researchers said that they had been looking for an indoor responsive, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had found them because one of them had given comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet video page YouTube.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's Secret Service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermigration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held over days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the unreasonable mountains in the northwest, which became a terrorist refugee.
They were considered part of a hidden operation.
Therefore they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged at all and continued to seek the right recommendations to obtain access to the Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistan criminal authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are consulted by the FBI - underlines the decisive role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US Secret Service has made it a matter of highest urgency to put human assets within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization act as a parrot who do not let those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spiones.
American Wishers' recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Kaida, analytics said.
However, because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda values, they are also considered unprecedented attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, ranked analyst of the NEFA Fund with seat in the United States, said that in recent years terrorist groups have become much more careful in order to allow access to those who have access, since the US home services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to put someone into these groups, what better way could you go than follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand climate-"Action" in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded more courageous actions in the city's Bella Congress Centre for Climate Protection.
Demonstrants said that 1000,000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates were rather of about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists burned small blowing bodies near some government buildings in the city centre.
On one day, when the climate negotiations supported by the UN had little, thousands of activists walked through the city with transparent activists on which "There is no planet B" in English and one in Spanish, which explained "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travels to Peru, the country of birth of their mother, make her aware of the heartwarming problems that the country has to fight with because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why I decided to participate in the great demonstration - to extend the word and appeal to the world leaders, to make a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not a easy task, but it has to be done now and there's no way anymore that leads it around.
The police stopped the demonstrations from approaching the Bella Center too close to and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or included pocket knives.
According to the Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a viewer who did not want to be mentioned, since he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrations in black clothes burned several blowing bodies near the Copenhagen main channel, in which several ministers are near.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, and added that they started as light missiles, but then followed by "a few big explosions".
In the interior of the Congress Centre, people gathered in front of television screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest seems not to have reached the consciousness of the main functionaries, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate dealer.
When he was asked whether he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he answered in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He then went on in Mandarin and said, "Because the place of event is big, I can't hear what happens outside."
He noted that it depends on the individual's perspective, whether the demonstration would damage or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "man can also say that they disturb the negotiations or freedom of other people".
Test data show thorough racial climbs
The evidence of mathematics performance was welcome to the public schools in Washington D.C. last week.
Although the district of Washington is still far behind the schools of the country, which produce maximum benefits, the evidence shows that the four- and eight-classes in the past two years have made faster progress than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) national evaluation of educational progress, is the thorough performance gap between Afro-American and white students, both at local and national level.
The average number of white classes from Washington D.C. increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) in the last two years, but only by three points from 209 to 212.
Performance climbs increased in reality between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the Afro-American Eight Classors remained essentially the same, he fell to a statistically neglectable point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data as the sample range was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The climb, which separated white and black fourth classes in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has grown in this period, the difference with now has little decreased by 58 points.
Some educational supporters of the district expressed their concern last week that the results that were celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were most of white students who are already powerful children.
This indicates that we have raised the overall assessment by treating those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, member of the Executive Board of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group entering for equality of education in Washington D.C.
I don't jump up and down for a span of two or three points, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Grundschule.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said that the message of checkpoint numbers is that the centre schools of the city need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what scares me is that we don't turn closer to the time and energy that we should use for our high school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weaker students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new lecture plan, the Wilson reading system, which aims at students in the upper classes of the primary and middle school, the basic skills of reading have not been mastered at the beginning of their school course and which are significantly behind their same-age classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that puts the front of children’s garden to the sixth class of games and life-sighted experiences, was brought to Washington under the former head of school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work on the best measures to benefit the students below the level of notes, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and continue to provide the additional money and resources for the low-performance schools needed to reduce the climb.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, investigating urban test results.
The conventional cure is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could lead to political retrospects working against this important point of agenda.
The weakness point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that it is trying to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the city districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements to close the performance climb is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the Charter Schools.
You have to increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he considers to be "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than a future prospect
The bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 rises out and blinds for a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the bricks and the smaragd green grass.
Gracielas parents have hardly completed the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was stored in Silver Spring and now lived in Riverdale, had never set a foot on a college campus.
Her attitude and those of the other Eight Classors of the Group, who explore Gettysburg, where the education costs 38.690 dollars per year, was rather the one of a disgusting visitor, than the ones of an enthusiastic future students.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" Graciela cried, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was reported the low professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The college in Pennsylvania was the seventh who visited the children on their three-day tour and now they fully accepted the intentional message: The question is not whether to go to the college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Hispanic immigrants who do not end high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but there are also hundreds of thousands of people who receive college training that is necessary to rise to the middle layer.
In fact, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispano Americans closes the college – which is a remarkable performance, since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came into the United States without having completed the high school.
Their success stories are important, says researchers, because for a generation that will play a huge role in the labour forces of the country, they show the way forward.
Those who explore powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for the school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals and find ways to compensate their lack of confidence with American schools.
But consulting programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially if these efforts remain for a longer time.
If you look at incoming poor children whose parents do not have the experience and skill to help them search through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supporting network for these children from the preschool to the high school.
The federal programme that Gracielas's college tour had financed is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - turn up one gang - and provides more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems to start college preparing programs that start when incoming poor students are in the middle school and continue to run until they have completed the high school.
According to the US Education Department, the programme has helped over 10 million students, of which more than 60% went to college since 1999.
Iraqi Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has been able to bring larger oil companies back to their damaged infrastructure at two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 agreements concluded with foreign oil companies from the Iraqi Ministry of Oils point out that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that gave a command has drawn the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thin seed representatives of American oil multitis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
After 6 years of war, Iraq finally opened its gates and, instead of US companies, gave Asian and European the way, Ruba Husari, the publisher of the Iraq Oil Forum, said an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, which were still underlined by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday and political instability by the deduction of the U.S. military, are likely to have prevented American oil companies from engaging more in Iraq, which has the world's third largest proven raw oil reserves.
U.S. companies were in some cases disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and rather risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies who could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been assisted with technical advice in recent years, have been empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors at two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two large fields.
We all know, said the speaker of the Oil Ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the great world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its companions and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
For the pre-payment provision, companies issued tenders, which were then compared with the fee per barrel oil, which the Ministry was ready to pay in order to increase the outlet of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In the event of an obvious U.S. rocket attack along the Pakistan border to Afghanistan, this week is expected to have been killed a top planner of Al Kaida, so representatives of the U.S. terrorism fighting reported on Friday.
This would, if it was confirmed, be the second fatal attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organization in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabians who were supposed to have been killed by a number of missiles in the region in accordance with the US source and Pakistan authorities, which took their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North-Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistanian civil secret service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Local residents who were suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the place and quickly took all the remaining of the "completely destroyed bodies".
The local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. terrorist control showed uncertain evidence that Somali was one of the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, which led terrorist groups operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracy throughout the world, noticed a leading official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the tender character of the US-American air attacks on Pakistan.
It also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe, taking its central role as being given.
He adopted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and put them into operation plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. representative said that Somali had rapidly risen in the Al-Kaida hierarchy and had best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but this does not reduce the danger that he represented for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban leader who was killed since September when a similar attack on Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed.
The pace of attacks by drones of the CIA has been declined from an average of six operations per month to two since summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline can be based on improved terror groups' tactics, which have taken steps to reduce their attackability and, at the same time, brutally kill suspicious informants, the page reported.
The leading UN missionary in Kabul will withdraw
On Friday, the leader of the UN in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said that he would be withdrawn from his office in March, thus ending a stormy term of office, which was defeated by claims of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
The Obama government decided to send further 30 000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The United Nations Sender said that he supports the increase in troops, but he also expressed his concern that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which is to begin in 18 months, could motivate other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and thus send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a call interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help with the political change in Afghanistan.
The army increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civil side, he said.
Eide said that he does not place his office, but only meets an agreement in March 2008 against his family to stay in Kabul only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN-
General Secretary Ban Ki-moon is now passing on to have time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he better starts looking for a follower, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the journey of my pastor and my arrival.
Ban started searching for a replacement according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he considered the Swedish-Italian-voting Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Bagdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eides position in Afghanistan was tested after his former vice-president, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the presidential elections in the country and to exchange evidence of massive fraud.
Ede has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - have undoubtedly damaged the mission because already a large degree of skepsis in relation to international interference in the elections.
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civil representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American armies in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to set up more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Ede expressed his disappointment about the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the UN conventional regimes have undermined its possibilities to bring qualified people in.
The UN rules have been so designed that I have been able to set only one person since May, he said.
It's a catastrophe and it can't go on like that.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran has to expect additional sanctions
Defence minister Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon hang "between additional sanctions" over Iran because he has not participated in discussions about his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of approximately 300 US soldiers in the North Irak during a 7-day journey through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq and played the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good choices, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years that has been unpredictable to war."
The Obama government considers a sanction package targeting the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates announced that some sanctions could also affect the average iranians.
He said that a "packet of positive and negative incentives" is needed to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons", because "your people will suffer incredibly" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion from the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American Government joined the European top politicians in the warning that Iran must expect "glowing" consequences if he does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its Atomic Monitoring Organisation, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
In discussions in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that he would resume the discussions on the restriction of his nuclear programme and refrain from a substantial part of his stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for his medical research reactor.
The US Government has urged this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
Iran, however, seems to have left the negotiations to the provisional agreements since that time - partly, experts say because Iran's leadership is unanimous about whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community with regard to some proposals which it had already agreed at the beginning of October, openly said that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, has gathered in a way as they were never in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set a deadline for Iran on 31 December to respond to these proposals before he continues to pursue other options, including those referred to as "repressing sanctions" by Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
In an opinion delivered in New York, the Iranian Representation with the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "unfunded and unfunded claims" by some of the Security Council members on Iran's nuclear activities and said that they are willing to continue the discussions with the United States and five other world powers, "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oily Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish government representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and because of the sharing of public income.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays in the US plans to reduce the American force from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to disrupt the Kurdish concern about the coming troop withdrawal. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We won't leave you."
A change in courses in the older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters who held lectures to them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
These lessons they learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who, due to the low birth rate and the older population this summer, suddenly began to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than one child, was their answer immediately and definitively: "Not in any case."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of one-child politics in China, which has produced two generations of notorically thick, abducted individual children, who are lovingly called "small emperor", is a crises of population in the country.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per pair compared to 6 at the time this policy entered into force, the UN
The department for population issues is determined, while the number of populations of 60 years and older in 2020 is to increase from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent explosively by 2050. This is far above the global average of approximately 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and elderly people accounted for almost 22 percent of the reported inhabitants of Shanghais, while the birth rate is below one child per pair.
Xie Lingli, Head of the Shanghaier City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples in a productive age need to have babies to "help to reduce the proportion of older populations and to facilitate the lack of labour in the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old - but not as rich - as the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive relaxation
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial available, which has been introduced by the dominant Communist Party until today.
Parents who violate this policy must expect huge penalties - up to their three-fold annual salary in some regions - and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese representatives have attributed to this policy that the critical use of natural national resources could be avoided, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of policies.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to drive away.
Many couples had also allowed sex-based abortions to be carried out, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude to one-child politics.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been individual children -- and the tone of many harsh struggles was mildered in 2007.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to allow two children in which a partner is a single child.
Shanghai was the first Chinese city in July, which launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Placates who taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by directives that detailed describe who gets into question for a second child and how to apply for the authorisation.
The city administration has sent urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and to push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outer areas of Shanghai said that there is a rise in the applications of couples, who want to have a second child after the campaign started, but the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000 inhabitants, as an example, only four to five applications per month are still made.
Disappointed Shanghaier officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city will still be around 165.000 despite the campaign -- something higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghaier municipality Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have children.
They want to give her the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was also legally allowed.
But they have, as many Chinese, only a small sickness and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West judge one-child politics falsely as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, you're robbing us the possibility of having more than a child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other pairs indicate psychological reasons for their arrival.
Wang, the head of staff, said she wants only a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used that everyone cared for us.
We are not used to care for others and we do not really want this."
Chen Sieian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unblomer.
For parents from the middle course with double career, by which the birth rate is lowering, he said, it turns to be successful and to be egoistic.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
A single child, he said, also sets huge demands for the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the room question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is nine months old, you must already have a lifetime ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are ready to do this once, said Chen, but not twice.
Our generation is the first one who has achieved a higher standard of life, he said.
We don't want to offer too many sacrifices.
The UN Group develops plans for reducing emissions
The UN's climate conference - which has so far been awarded by wild poses and mutual accusations - has put back a focus on Friday with the publication of a document, which for the next 40 years has recorded an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases, where the industrial nations would have to train the largest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a definitive policy agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, has highlighted both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was considered important progress in a negotiating time, since next week more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen.
The text, which has been formulated by a UN working group for this purpose, swears over the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large threshold countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature increases would be that of policy makers.
The process will be given a great flexibility, says John Coequyt, director of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-sided document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the leading representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, called "the great whole".
It shows the basic risk of a possible agreement in which industry nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020, compared to 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent during the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
In addition, the European Community has awarded the discussions on Friday an incentive by its assurance to provide 3.6 billion US dollars per year over the next three years in order to support poorer countries in adapting the effects of climate change - from the master of floods and drying to the avoidance of forests.
On Friday, however, the same verbal fireworks, which the conversations had decided last week, brought.
The U.S. Climate Special Representative Todd Stern has rejected formulations that require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger thresholds, if not financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government is driving a harder line with China, as representatives of the Bush government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the rise of larger thresholds and take measures, says Stern, who also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern delivered his opinion an hour after the explanation of the Chinese Vice-President He Yafei, who said that the leading American air conditioner either lacks "the sense" or it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
The future economic march of the great world powers is at stake, and both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrial nations and the developing countries, has opened broken lines.
The current struggle relates to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, whereas China and the United States reject themselves because of their obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozens of influence rich countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great forces are fighting for who should bear the costs of braking the greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have taken more aggressive action to account for the countries with very high greenhouse gas charges for their actions.
This is clearly a game, which will develop a new economic rule, so Ulate, who is also working as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries who are most exposed to the effects of climate change claimed that they would continue to fight for a legally binding Treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the discussions will in best case lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a draft contract on the early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the islands of the small islands have "political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand measures from the developing countries, such as China and India.
The discussions received a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions must be resolved before the government leaders arrive in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, like the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister, disappeared their planes and rushed through the gates of the Bella Centre to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to put off claims negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the congregation -- 13,000 people go in and out every day at the Congress Centre, guitar-playing activists organize nightly shows where they make fun of the countries who believe they are betraying and selling, and draft contracts are being made hand-to-handed instead of by e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just based on: almost all important ministers are now here and from Wednesday 60 government leaders in Copenhagen will be.
We come to Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President of the Global Policy of the Organisation of Conservation International.
The weights are coming.
Great Britain’s first 225 km/h fast train defines the Monday feeling new
On Monday morning at 5:13 a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce an admission trip which represents a revolution in the traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed pendant train in the country will reach 225 km/h at its lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and set 93 km back in 38 minutes.
At Lord Adonis, Minister for Transport, lady Kelly Holmes will then enter on board the first Javelin Pendler Service from London.
He hopes that the new United Kingdom service will eventually connect to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large urban areas of Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living pendler cities, working hours would radically reduce and the change of aircraft and car to train would reduce the national carbon emissions and the stables on the streets.
In the theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
However, the many billions of British pounds, which are needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still bring the brake in the British high-speed glasses.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will submit the report on 30 December, according to the Times.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which London is to connect to the West Midlands, will pass with a five-metre gaming space in urban areas and in places where the impacts on the environment are controversial.
In the open area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route, which would lead a single high-speed route to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel period between London and Edinburgh would decrease to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first subroad, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with today a little more than one hour.
The drafts offer the trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters long trains can drive on it with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This would, again, mean that in London, a final station would be needed where 20.000 travellers could be completed per hour.
Given the spatial restrictions in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station would be expanded to undergo the high-speed network.
Train experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures will mean that a final decision will be taken only after Parliament's elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains should first change from the high-speed routes on existing railways in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to travel between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered to be a decisive stop point to ensure a change from a plane to a train, a direction for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers appear for hypothesis for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading sub-house member of the Conservatives, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the costs of an orange, which he is building in his home in his electoral circle.
The prison speaker of the party, degraded by David Cameron because he complained that underhouse members must live "of magnificent rations", has increased his hypothecum by 75,000 pounds in order to build an oak timber cultivation at his second house in Rutland.
He allowed the taxpayer to account for the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The managers of the sub-house approved the applications at that time and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditure of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-house members, has a two-story house in a village in his elective district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses a purchase price of almost a million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living rooms and dining rooms, but the Fees Office, an expense control point of the underhouse, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he cultivated a winter garden called "Orderie" in the plans.
Neighbors describe him as a "glashaus for entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited by the Committee on Standards and Privileges to take a view of increased monetary recording during a recent investigation of his previous hypothesis contracts.
The Committee has released it last month after an examination of its expenditure from the breakdown of the rules.
In 2004 Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of more than 271.406 pounds (30,000 euros) from his London house to his electoral circuit, which he bought in 1991, one year before his election as a Member of the Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received approximately 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a hypothecene rate.
In April, its claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS hypothec has not changed during this period, which suggests that the total increase in the financing of the funding of 75,000 pounds (85,000 euros).
The normal stabless RBS hypothecence rate fell from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the sub-house show that Duncan continued to claim its right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month in May.
Duncan lost his position as the opposition leader of the sub-house in September after a undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the expenditure scandal that parliamentary members would live "of magnificent rates".
"In essence, if you work for the state, you have to live on magnificent rates and how S***e is treated."
He said, "I have spent my money for my garden and raised the right to a disappearing small portion, measured by what belongs.
And I could have demanded all the fucking sum, but I don't."
The parliamentary member, millionary from his former career as an oil-gross dealer, was attacked for the first time in May because of his expenditure, when it was clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before he had declared with the Fees Office that this could be considered "overdriven demand".
As a protester in Duncan's Rasen, an activist buried a hole in the form of a pound mark after being known that he had requested 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When he was questioned about the elevated hypothec yesterday night, Duncan said: "This had been approved both by the Fees Office and then by Add to the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate on excesses and strikes or a disguise of the rules or similarities.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clear."
Come all of you believers to admire Brighton's Advent Calendar
Beach cabins in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries by creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their houses with Christmas songs for each December day.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to view the latest cabin every day from 17:30 to 18:30 p.m. on free light wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dry fruit baggage pieces.
The Christmas songs selected up to now are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a honorable clergyman of the Chichester diocese and leader of Beyond.
He said, "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach cabin advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and living place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated on Saturday and Copenhagen worldwide to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate heating, where the police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, are marched in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations Climate Conference, which should lead to a conclusion which could enter into force from 2013 until Friday.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish Chairman of the Climate Conference, increasing mobilisation in the world contributes to the climate, which is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the train had passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed completely in black, crushed windows with patch stones and inhibitors, established a journalist of the AFP.
Anti-unruption police have intervened immediately and without respect.
The police announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your appreciation mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, were arrested in the east of France, in April, at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of demonstration, has undergone the conditions under which hundreds of militants had been arrested "without distinction", sharply criticized, and has underlined that about a hundred of you were "always held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and seat position.
The more peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrations have stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the planned speakers, welcome for an evening with light light, with the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the demonstrations have been travelling with fines and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, and some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of you with heavenly blue rainmantles, have made a first race in Copenhagen in the morning, as you have followed the call of the friends of the earth,"blue times" for the "Climajustiz".
Today we go to the streets to demand a reconciliation of the ecological debt to the benefit of the south , said Lidy Nacpil, Philippinian activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue like this and say: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, water run where you can walk, as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of the Climate Diplomation, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
MEP José Bové, the design of the globalisation critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climage law and social justice": "Today there is no difference between fighting against climate heating and fighting for another world."
The Asian-Pazifican area, where many islands are particularly threatened as a result of heating, has given the start-up of the demonstrations.
Approximately 50 000 people have gone to the streets, according to the Australian organizers.
In Manila there were some hundreds of people, mostly students marched in red and hated bandanas, in which you praised the sun's energy.
In Hong-Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, march of some hundred demonstrations took place in order to require an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network have gathered some hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille, South, in Lille (North), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abchasia has chosen his President, Georgia denounces that it is a "Strike" here.
On Saturday, Abchasia chose his President, which happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian region as independent, Tbilissi denounced the "Streich".
Approximately 131,000 people were invited to participate in the first election after the Russian-Gorgean war of August 2008 for control over the South-Ossetic territory, another Georgian Sessionist area that was recognised by Russia.
The electoral rooms have closed GMT at 17 p.m.
The electoral participation was about 58%, according to the Abchasian Election Commission responsible, a few hours before the electoral closure.
The first preliminary results should be published in the night from Saturday on Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former President, Serguei Bagapch, are gradually rejecting the idea of a reunion with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On his part, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, repentant that Abchasia is now under a safe total occupation, has explained his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
Besides Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the autonomy of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it a part of Georgia, which is occupied by Russia.
After it was separated from Georgia during the 1992 - 1993 conflict, with several thousand people died, Abchasia wants to prove by this choice that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have chosen Lord Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to a choice room in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palms before the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Great signs on which Bagapch is seen at the side of the Russian President and of the Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are located everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the Head of District, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor elections.
We, the Abchasian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a reference to the support of Moscow, in particular with regard to the decision to recognise Abchasia's autonomy.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, answered a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements reached with Moscow in the previous year, as the one in which Abchasia leaves Russia the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Copenhagen incidents
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready to use, have taken about 700 people at the edge of an important demonstration.
Forty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cave in the Danish capital, which will receive the delegates from 193 countries, which are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Parliament marched the peaceful train towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The demonstrations have stopped about 500 meters from the centre and have not tried to enter.
A stage was built to welcome the planned speakers for one evening with candlelight, taking part in the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators who were completely dressed in black and had been armed with backstones and inhibitors began to hit discs, a journalist of the AFP established.
Anti-unruption cops have circulated you immediately and have handled without care by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police announced that 600 to 700 persons were arrested and made clear that they were mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extreme violent splitter groups, which have already been famous at the Summit of Nato in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
By the evening, a policeman suffered an injury by a patch in the incidents where, according to the police, about twenty persons were preliminary arrested. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in control," explained the speaker of the police, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the regulators cream in the air.
Most demonstrators who traveled by train or by their own vehicle from German large cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the heavenly blue rainmantle, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after calling the "Friends of the Earth" into a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climage rights".
"Today we go to the road to demand that the ecological debts be paid back to the people of the south," explained the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't tell us anymore: We still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that squeeze, there are water runs through which you can run, which was never the case before."
The first time in the history of Climate Diplomation, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation counterparts has approached the environmental organisations.
The French Member of the European Parliament and the globalisation critic José Bové, said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer a difference today between the fight against earth's heating and the struggle for another world."
The organisation of Oxfam has mobilized several individuals, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asian-Pazifican area, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to the heating of the earth, has led to the demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50 000 people have gone to the street according to the words of the organizers.
In Manila, some hundreds of people, in the majority of students, dressed red with bandanas, have made advertising before the city administration of the philippinian capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrations have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organized by the "net of 350" several hundred people, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and in Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
The fields of geography and history, according to Chatel, are strengthened from the school reform of Lycéen.
The National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview that in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" appeared that the phages were strengthened by geography and history from the school reform of the Lycés, even if they were not required to be taught in terminals (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) have now every four hours and the same program," confirmed Mr. Chatel.
For the minister "must be overcome this shine holiness," because after him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but in general a concentration "the best student".
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a subprofile of the scientific one," he continued. He emphasized: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who had been intimidating about the lack of historical geographic education in the terminals on technical lyces."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey appeared in the Humanité showed that almost seven out of ten French (69%) criticise the State project of the removal of obligatory education in history and geography in the S terminals (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also lacked this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
The minister answered that there was no question about restricting the philosophy of the programme of the S terminals.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (study and trade unions) had called on Tuesday to protest against the project, which, according to their opinion, will be the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister argued that at the beginning of the year, in Master 2 (M2), they undertake a professional suitability examination and at the end of the year of an approval test, in which their teaching skills are examined.
In addition, they carry out practices during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as a teacher in the practice.
He continued to say: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you can reach more hours you spent before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the minister explained that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a case that does not exist in education."
He confirmed again that he wanted to cancel the school card "to 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the use at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to deal with on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP noted, the Peace Nobel Prizemaker Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts call for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions to the audience.
You want to do something to reach people and to wake in them the feeling of learning more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the pool of the school.
"The experts were elected around the twenty participants, even after their charisma," he clarified.
"For air conditioning, you can speak for hours. But the main goals can also be presented in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely with the help of films before about 50 people.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed in the hope that the listeners might take away from the fact that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on a completely serious scientific dossier."
The videos rotated by these conferences will be online on the page of the school from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will take place every two months.
Payment delay : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the trade unions of the penal officers called for a general day of action to achieve the transfer of the premiums and overtimes of which payments were suspended for budgetary reasons until January before Christmas holidays.
The second trade union of prison officials ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on the employees who did not have a service to demonstrate on Tuesday tomorrow before the prisoner and to block them to pay attention to the "theft of what is to them".
The third trade union of CGT-Pénitentiaire called on "to unite itself for a strong mobilisation in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the overtimes, night supplements and the sun and holiday supplements in December will be burned as "shard and unacceptable".
The first union of criminal officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Society (UFAP/UNSA), called on "General Mobilisations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the penalty agency and the Ministry of Justice explained that the overtimes increased significantly in 2009 and were not all in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims are paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of the penalty officers in which the payment is guaranteed next month.
"I am very well aware of the efforts of the staff to maintain and modernise our penalty system," the Minister of Justice informs in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the prisoner to take measures immediately so that such a situation, which has arisen by a lack of estimation of the overtimes, will not be repeated in the future," added Mrs. Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December wage is more magnificent, except for the management staff that comes into the enjoyment of high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA for which the "budgetary forces" must be held.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional FO union in Marseille advocates to boycotting "all congregations and calls" up to new instructions.
"The staff are not going on Sundays and holidays at work, if then the hours of October in December are still not paid. This is also true for their overtimes," also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
"In a time when more and more tasks are taken to us without more staff being stopped, the attempt to enrich the staff's money is more than inappropriate," says the CGT trade union of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is incorrect, as the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he distributes Christmas ever better gifts than he gets himself.
The American President, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas for the first time with his family in the White House, has been proclaiming at the TV speaker Oprah Winfrey that he will distribute ever better gifts than he gets himself.
When a special broadcast was broadcast on Sunday evening through the ABC channel, the President and his wife Michelle gave insights on how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrated home.
Even Bo, the small four-bened companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog of course also receives a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected the claims of her husband for the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she necks the President.
"That's why," he appealed to her snatchy and pointed to the first lady's pearl chain, "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour radiation in an unforced atmosphere with the well-known TV operator, Barack Obama had supported so fiercely during his election campaign, the President and his wife also talked about gifts that she loved as a child most.
Barack Obama remembered a bike with ten walks and also a basketball that his father, which he very rarely saw, had brought him to Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the President.
"But a lot later in my life I understood that I had this ball from him."
The first lady remembered her puppet house.
"I didn't know how to order the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the chamber. But I loved this little popping house," Michelle Obama told.
Johnny Hallyday again surgery, RTL confirms that he has been transferred to artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again surgered in Los Angeles because of significant "injuries" after a surgery in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was moved into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated in the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Wednesday to Thursday after the American doctors had discovered "injuries due to the operation of a bandship incident", which he had suffered in Paris on 26 November, his production company in Paris, which added that these damages would have re-operated.
However, the singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and informed that a new medical advice would be available at least in 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was moved into an artificial coma to avoid "smerches and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, there was a little more certainty about the condition of the patient than he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
CRL also confirms that "from certain sources", that after his first operation in Paris, "non-line drenage" was made.
The Rocker had been surgered in the International Clinic of Parc Monceau because of a bandship incident.
The intervention planned over several days was carried out by the neurochirurg Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments against RTL.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was introduced on Monday at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles due to a follow-up infection after the intervention.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was convinced against RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley". However, he assured that you need "no worry" to make the rock musician, as this "a good fighter" is.
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him it was stupid to put himself in a plane after such an operation for twelve hours, that's not how it goes," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts good on antibiotics" and that "the infection was damned."
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he had no special concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the health of the singer has grown since he brought in a hospital in July nine days after he had crashed on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was the speech that Johnny Hallyday had a "small darm cancer OP" which led to a light infection.
At the end of September, the singer, as planned, took his long "Tour 66" as a goodbye tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer was trying to move on the stage.
First in mid-November, the people surrounding him had to denote a re-introduction to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet on its favorite distance
French Frédérick Bousquet, three-fold medal winner at the Swimming World Championships 2009, took an international title on Thursday about his favorite distance, 50m free style, at the Euro-2009 on the short course in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a real record flow was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verrazto over 4 x 200 m layers and the two other through Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the gentlemen.
Shade for Bousquet, who wanted to take the 50m free style after the World Record, whose record he holds in the large basin (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in swimming, 50m free style, the 28-year-old French claimed in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet rejected the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever bigger and in this case I said, when the world record is in my range, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all the swimmers started in polyurethan suits that are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their Epos in Istanbul, which started the same competition for the first time in 1999.
The use of the combination has not been paid for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and World Record at the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m free style (3:32.77), yet with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Gleesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't reach a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
United States : Country plates at Zola estimated to $1.5 million
A Roman plate, which appeared in the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, says the art dealer Sotheby's.
This record is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the third century after Christ and has always been evaluated with $150.000 to $250.000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionisus are represented in a sophisticated architecture decor, surrounded by Satyren and Bacchusfigures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby's, on Tuesday towards the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is surely what the buyers have offered most to now," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes far back.
The plate was nearly 300 years at home in the famous collection of the Borghese family, afterwards she showed pieces for piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the IIIrd French Republic and President of the Council before Marschall Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
In the search of the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of an "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the Fresko "Rougon Macquart".
Zelaya's excursion attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been destroyed
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for transfer of the falling honduran president Manuel Zelaya on domestic ground as no longer compatible after this lead had rejected by the Putsch government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya held in the night, it seems that everything seems to point out that it is inconsistent about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft set by the Mexican Government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transfer of M. Zelayas, was returned to its exit.
The Putsch government wanted M. Zelaya to "recognition" and to ask him for political asylum in abroad.
However, the crashed President rejected this because he wanted to return to Mexico as the most welcome, official Head of State.
The Putsch regime "has experienced another failure by moving me to give up on my costs (...), they wanted me to take off," said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, where he has often reported to speak since the beginning of the political crisis that has been holding up in the Mediterranean country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the crashed President who had escaped into the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with some accords.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted a request for guidance, which we unfortunately cannot accept, because it does not include a request for asylum, had explained on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Putsch Government, to the honduran radio HRN.
I'm not looking for any country around asylum, Manuel Zelaya had responded to an interview with the Telesur channel whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible trip from Honduras, so he had underlined, he would only be president of the Honduran people.
On Wednesday, the rumors of a trip to M. Zelayas mobilized the followers of the crashed president, who opened up to the Brazilian message and gathered around them, and the military there had strengthened his effort.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch Government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the light of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the Socialist Venetian President, Hugo Chavez, was disturbed on 28 June, on the day of his organized national survey to prepare his re-elective, against the Council of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and had escaped into the Brazilian message.
If he leaves this, he is arrested for high betrayal, whose accusation he is accused of justice, so the Putsch government.
The President Roberto Micheletti has succeeded in organising a presidential election on 29 November to trigger M. Zelaya.
Although Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the controversial election, the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, argenines or Brazil were rejected.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against M. Zelaya's return to the office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.
Wall Street in the wake, the US trade balance nourishes optimism
The New York exchange completed with a high Thursday, the numbers of the US Trade Balance prove a curriculum of the United States shares and their partners: the Dow Jones has added 0.67%, Nasdaq is 0.33%.
According to the figures at exchange closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10.405,83 points, the Nasdaq again dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The expanded Index Standard & Poor ́s 500 was charged by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
There are good news from different industries, Lindsey Piegza judged by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotic under the presumption that the market focuses only on "half full glasses", so it measured.
According to Peter Cardillo by Avalon Partners, the investors are especially fixed on the numbers of the American trade balance, "which has improved activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared to September.
In contrast, the analysts had expected to increase with a deficit.
Imports as well as exports have increased.
The major news is the increase in the total volume of trade, particularly in the export of goods reflecting the economic growth of the main trade partners in the United States, Christopher Cornell commented on company research Economy.com.
On the other hand, the unemployment reports in the United States have increased in the last week against all expectations and have now reached the status of 474,000 requests.
However, in the last four weeks, the average value of new job seekers had fallen "to the depth of the year," Scott Marcouiler of Wells Fargo Advisors stressed.
The obligation market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has increased to 3.482 % compared to 3.432 % from the evening of the service, the profitability of the loans to 30 years to 4.492 % compared to the 4.408 % from the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of power-sided partisans pfeife "Damen in Weiss" from
On Thursday, some hundreds of cuban-powered parties have excavated the wives gathered in Havana for the purpose of the world-wide day of human rights by political prisoners and also destroyed another announcement, due to which a good dozen dissident was temporarily arrested.
Forty "Damen in Weiss", wives or nearby political prisoners, were excavated on the open street of partisanians of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the Fussmarch to the centre of the capital in order to demand the liberation of political prisoners, so a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Lower with the Yankes!, "Soldner!", "The street belongs to the revolutionarys!", "It lives fidel and Raul!" scanned the powered partisans with lifted faust against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil agents who appeared to "serve protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Damen in Weiss" had been played in Havana in the evening before, where it was neither injured nor arrested.
On the other hand, a dozen dissident, who was temporarily arrested by civil politicians, which also took place on Thursday's demonstration in view of the International Day of Human Rights, confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
The police have, according to this journalist, forced the dissidents built by the government under violence in civil vehicles.
The temporary imprisonment of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates to the Sakharov prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Damen in Weiss" organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of the "bitte for the release of all political prisoners", whose number, according to dissident list, is about 200 persons, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, from which up to the date 53 are behind the grids.
The Cuban authorities feel the regime owners as "soldner" or "agents" in the service of the declared archfound, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that the Cuban television reported the demonstration events held on Thursday between militant pro-regation fighters and "Contra-revolutionary" reports.
The Cuba, led by a unity party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disadvantaged rights and freedoms, in particular of freedom of opinion.
Wahnsinnige kills eighty-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-messed madman killed an eighty-year-old one on Friday by late afternoon to the main business time in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five more people.
According to the first inquiry, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-olds in or before a pharmaceutical on the Boulevard Jean-years with two knives and accordingly, police data, with the presence of Witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is reported by an officer of the police syndikate Alliance in the hospital to expose the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he knocked a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the threes, has intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were severely injured to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life, as he, according to police sources, seems to have affected vital bodies.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events, and she is supposed to have been hospitalized in a police source in the state of shock.
The armed man, who seemed to be under alcohol or drug influence according to police statements, should be disappeared immediately on the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have hurt two more passengers, apparently randomly: a three-six and a forty-year-old, with the last one of both severe.
The scene remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives, which he had crossed behind his back, explained in the area of Arnaud Pressé, a responsible man of the Syndikate Alliance of the area of Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passengers, including young people, should have tried, according to the reports of witnesses identified by the AFP, to resist the crazy one.
I saw a guy in the three-shirts with a green west.
Three youths tried to get in.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, Alberto, a cellar of a nearby bar, reported.
A horde fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke the army.
On the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the number of the house 61, two city policemen, including their boss, have tried to arrest the armed man and have been injured with knives, so police information.
The event has been played in one of the main strikes of Clichy-la-garnee, where a number of businesses are located.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought it to the first-help postage and noticed a clapping wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came injured by cutting wounds.
The forces of the state police have finally arrested the man who had no certificates with him.
Nanterre's State Prosecutor has commissioned the District Reference of the Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92).
The crazy one was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not been heard in court.
A police source does not preclude it from being transmitted to a nerve healing agency.
According to another police source, six cops petitioned him at the police commission in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "in a state of surgery" as "all spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the tather course".
United States: Polanskis lawyer calls for reconciliation of criminal persecution
The lawyer of the French-polish filmmaker Roman Polanski called for the repeated time on Thursday in Los Angeles (Californien, Western United States) to leave criminal persecution against his client who is currently at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral contradiction of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", has raised major procedural errors before three judges of the court of appeal in the second district of California at the time of negotiation in 1977.
I ask for a penalty, said M. Hummel before adding that the behavior of the Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was responsible for the proceedings, "lacing down a cold back".
He believed that the judge Rittenband, who died now, had discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him that Roman Polanski deserved cultivation house, before he fell his prosecution.
This discussion was raised in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), especially by the questioning prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September to have the authors of the documentary film "belogen".
If the Court of Justice refuses to terminate the criminal procedure, Mr Hummel requires the conduct of a trial which would allow him to present the evidence of his arguments.
The prosecution has repeated the proof already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the lifting of the deeds charged to the accused cannot be seriously considered, as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old director had escaped from the United States in 1978 before the proclaiming of the criminal measure because of "legal sexual relations" with a minor age of 13 years.
Since that time, he has no longer traveled to the United States.
The Vice-President of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, explained that Roman Polanski must be "to attend the negotiations".
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused ones who are a way of escape?, asks Mrs Asayma.
In their opinion, "the film maker asks the Court of Justice for a favor and thereby despises his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days of time to announce their decision – even emphasized that there were other escape alternatives.
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the cessation of criminal persecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also asked again for abolition of the criminal procedure.
She reminded that her client would no longer endure it to be distressed by any reconsideration of the Affaire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Two and thirty years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, on the occasion of an American arrest order.
After spending two months behind grids, he was condemned in the expectation of any delivery to the house arrest in his Chalet in Gstaad.
Wall Street is braked by the rise of the dollar and closed without a course.
The New York exchange closed on Friday without a course, in a market that was shaken between better than the US indicators and an increase in the dollar: The Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
On the basis of the final figures available when closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has delivered 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"Early, the market is quite calm," Mace stated view silver from Marblehead Asset Management.
"He remains strictly limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned to "contribute to improving market views to the solidity of the economic recovery," Charles Schwab's analysts merged.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus already two months in a row and much more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers has improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes were reduced by a new increase in the dollar price, which has reached the highest level compared to the euro for two months, thus pressing down '' the sectors affected by the economic situation', explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
This has resulted in some loss of technological values.
The obligation market has decreased.
The return on the treasure loan over 10 years increased by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482% and the loan over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Choice of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month's rounding through South Africa, the 112 candidates will cross the last barrier on Saturday to realise their dream: to be chosen to be the most beautiful woman in the world and this before a billion TV viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is organised for the second time in a row in the surroundings of Johannesburg, five of them have already taken their ticket to the semi-finale.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were cut to Miss Sportive or also Miss Top Model during her African stay.
This was a truly thread of pleasures.
Beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cap Horn, were just extraordinary.
I have seen many things and made a lot of experiences!" said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be transferred live on Saturday, from 17:00 p.m. (15 p.m. of Middle European Time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to surrender my crown.
This experience was just fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, stressed Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous experience exchanges with candidates and the rediscovery of "atmospheric landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, meetings with the press and Safari, the Miss is now focusing on competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to enter the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was chosen in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as Aishwarya Rai, which was chosen in 1994 and both were Bollywood stars.
It is of course the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about the appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organisers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defilate in traditional efforts and do not forget, in the bathroom suit.
The idea is presented by a TV operator, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the former beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and by a Miss World Committee responsible, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is a world of hardly overwhelming heart and pride to receive, assures Julia Morley, Chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time cost the bike and the local kitchen.
However, the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand.
Not usual for a Head of State, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, is undoubtedly the release in Cape Town (Southwest) to football world championship in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people who I might probably never get closer to.
I'm sure to return to the 2010 World Championship, promised excited Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is very positive, according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," insured his son David on Friday at his arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it's all going very well, explained David Hallyday of the press at the exit of the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 13 o'clock local time (21 o'clock MEZ) from Paris.
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would be "invited" to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was introduced to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection after a surgery on 26 November.
The singer was "assigned this night in Los Angeles to an artificial coma to facilitate his intense pain and to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors of Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles to an artificial coma, which was introduced in Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection after a bandship operation on 26 November.
The singer had to undergo a surgery in the night of Wednesday on Thursday due to the recent invasion of the diseased changes.
On Friday morning, his wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French University of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer of the AFP established.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and traumatic surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles Hospital on Monday.
The producer severely burdened Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer on 26 November in the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he made the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were totally distressed, explained Mr. Camus.
I heard that a court may be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has traveled too fast and this has traveled with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally called this doctor, who assured me that he viewed this trip as totally unproblematic, which had surprised me very, since I myself have two band disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before he announced at RTL that after the operation "without drainage, without everything" the singer would have left the hospital.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very famous in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practised at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematom after a brain bleeding.
However, he is also a doctor with doubtful reputation, who has been sentenced several times due to failures of surgery and not to forget, due to tax withdrawal and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the physician chamber, called him "a man without screwle", who has to be responsible for "regularly" before the Chamber Board and "everything other than recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This declared that the intervention would be "finished" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The surgery "does not cry out bleeding and therefore requires no drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been exercising since late summer, seems to be questioned.
It is obvious that it is too little for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), said Mr Camus.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) is energetic and calls on the Party Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal
On Friday, the Federation of Parties, supervised by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, responded intensely to an acquisition of the seal, who once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, from the Chairman of the Party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, urged him to use this seal no longer under threat of judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he considers that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had reached the left hand.
The Defence Minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To stress his efforts, he had received the support of the member of Hervé de Charette (ehemaly UMP, now at NC), who claimed the ownership of the UDF brand, as he first applied for this brand in 2004 at the Institut national de la propriété industriale.
However, the business counterparts of the UDF party alliance supervised by François Bayrous's friends broke silence and made clear that they were not able to dismiss and set a time limit to the Minister and to the Member under the threat of judicial persecution, to stop using this seal and to transfer the ownership rights of the brand.
In recent days, you have made a number of statements that you would suggest your political movement to take the UDF seal +, wrote the party bond in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the Party MoDem and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Alliance.
They also believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the slogan + the present UDF +, on their political material and on your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, declared the UDF's business office and urged the NC party to "unreasonably remove the name of UDF from all materials and (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette called for "to transfer the property rights of the brand to their legal rightors".
If you refuse this, we will raise a complaint against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their writing, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978 and reminds that Morin and his friends "had taken the choice" to leave them in 2007 in order to create a competitive movement, as it had already been done in 2002 to found the party "UMP".
According to the signatory, the party Nouveau Centre has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 adopted the three-year accession to the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business body to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the company continues, "was he at the time when he applied for the brand name, not a member of the UDF for three years, but of the UMP.
He profits in scandalous and fraudulent ways, from the lack of the rearing of the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
In addition, you consider that this disrespect is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC strategy: "It seems more valuable for us in politics and life to make ourselves a name rather than try to come out of anonymity by deceitfully applying a name on which you have no legal rights."
Affaire Liliane Bedencourt : François-Marie Banier is condemned for the exploitation of weaknesses
On Friday, the Court of Justice of Nanterre decided to assess the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionary Liliane bedencourt claims, he used a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to swallow himself some of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photographs, will have to be responsible on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the exploitation of weaknesses before court, a criminal offence that is committed to a punishment of no more than three years and a penalty of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that there will actually be a process in this affaire that is worth the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are feeting and at the same time have the cubits of the cosmetic imperium L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also arranged a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane bedscourt, which is jointly carried out by three doctors.
The Erbin and the main shareholder of L'Oréal have so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions presented during the investigation of Nanterre State Prosecutor.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to present a report before 10 March 2010 in which you will clearly explain whether and when Liliane Bedencourt may have been found in a state of weakness.
I think she will carry out these investigations.
I'll talk to her, explained the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the negotiation.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the Court.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, which you need to protect, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has launched a criminal prosecution against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artists, and accuses him to have exploited the weaknesses of her mother for years in order to swallow donations of a total of a billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt had always rejected to have been manipulated by the photographer who she views as a long-term friend.
Although the court would have to examine the acceptability of the complaint initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers of the lawyers led to a large family deficit on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three letters sent by his client to her notar (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusts the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "Please explain my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years, one to two times a day.
Françoise I have never been able to speak since her marriage."
The prosecutor of Nanterre is once again of the opinion that the applicant had no right to respond to this, especially because a prosecutor has rejected its application in recent days to initiate a judicial procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bedencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no foreworm.
Nobody has the right to act in their place," confirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to give a judgment after the process of permissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers.
Manager Revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Information?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing ...
For over a decade, the management of large companies in relation to their employees, the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: "values" for the staff is definitely the best, as it was previously designed to hang on the consumer products by the technicians in the work.
By giving the customer in the centre of the companies the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separated factors preferences of customers to hang again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the top of a much larger phenomenon that affects the employees in particular.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the company's intellectual functions, especially those of R & D and, which is even more crucial, on those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) calls for a proactive approach from all parties involved (...) and a future-oriented viewpoint; it claims a use by the employees that is completely contrary to the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we demand an operating revolution that would consist of setting employees at the centre of the company's affairs at the side of customers.
The very related benefit of internal opinions
Will the internal opinion questions, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to his wage recipients, encourage this revolution with regard to the management praxis?
I'm afraid, unfortunately not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that, given a new situation, it ended with many circumstances, the whole thing was going to do priorityly what it has always done.
Also because authoritarism - one of the pathologists of power - increases proportionately to its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Formerly from the large engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanical.
They take over by intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory recently reactivated by the US "Neurowsensciences" and uncertainly widespread by research institutions and media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to engage the "Hebel" (sic) in employees' engagement, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey published by Ipsos strengthens the leaders in a position to a mechanical control system that is inappropriate for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behaviour.
It is to integrate a basic protocol in any consideration or practice of control: for the payee, the commitment for the company is only possible if it appears clearly to be a means to achieve a part of its dreams, ambition and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their company on the basis of a given Doxa, which allows them to assess their perceived image of the company, what it offers them to achieve their goals of life.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and predict their "social performance" and place their human resource management back at the right place.
They thus create a fertile soil that is favourable to the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama praise from right
On Friday, the American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama in Oslo in the evening before, and was satisfied that the peace nobel price in 2009 defended the term "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who had spotted the award of the price to Obama on 9 October applauded this time the President's speech, the example of the former Vice-President's candidate in the 2008 elections Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained that the face of the right wings of the Republican party in the day newspaper USA Today, and added that it itself brought the topic of a "many necessity" war into its just published memoirs.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, strived to justify the use of violence in Oslo on Thursday; a way to explain his decision of nine days ago, to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, represented the opinion that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former President of the Representative House, who particularly recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway", said that this speech was quite historical.
The former Member, who is considered as a possible candidate for the republikan nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said that he was pleased to have seen a "President of the Left", who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they were "not free and could not deliver a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama held "a very American speech".
In addition to being "cosmopolite" as "he always makes it," he spoke "as an American President," when he pointed out that the Europeans "live in a safety blaze that they have not created themselves and for their protection do not do much," says Gerson.
Among the few, not convinced rights, the former UN Messenger John Bolton, a Falk of Era Bush, called the national Review Online website "smart, high-speaking and inspiring".
On the left side of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the withdrawal of forces.
If you pack the war under the deck of justice, the massacre is simply justified to the innocent, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left remains praiseful on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, who still believes that the Nobel Prize was early forgiven to Obama, called the speech itself for a speaker like him known for his talent as "monumental work".
The speech in Oslo "is offering a schedule for controlling international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," says California’s daily newspaper excited.
The New York Times believes that Obama "announced the necessary discourse" and calls his speech "darkness and example at the same time".
Driving drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that ensures Christmas supply
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening that ends the Strict Command and the threatening heavy supply passport.
At the signature session on Friday evening, the State Secretary Dominique Bussereau responsible for transport welcomed the agreement launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiation.
After a second negotiating night, the negotiators divorced early Friday morning in the hope to sign the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And that even though the three employer associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 a.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "had damaged the companies very much" and "it was to be afraid that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4 % for lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9 % for the highest wages groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for employees with the lowest wages rises from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"This isn't very much, but we're starting little first," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed to stop blocking the supply centres.
"There will probably always be some contradictors who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
The TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although it was" difficult to grant these salary increases in view of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wages groups.
"This agreement is based on healthy human understanding and respect for employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said "a acceptable compromise" in this regard.
The Agreement also provides for the increase of travel costs by 3 % and the maintenance of the total road transport unit in the first half of 2010, which will in particular allow the issue of 13 months and the modernisation of tariff contracts.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of the charges for employers at EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment from the government to the draft revised finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly in the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for "a identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the undertakings attached to this organisation and to then to apply in the event of an extension by the Ministry of Labour for the whole of the profession.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", insured Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The UNTR Association ranked a "fraudulent trade" because the 100 million euros "was already promised to compensate for some of the carbon taxes".
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but not to scatter the Gans-Essen on the nearby Christmas days, the Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens to "small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry to have a large grave in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest highway network in France for the large Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of striking between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independence of the Paris passenger transport management), which continues to wait with their demands for wages.
At this important shopping week before Christmas, no trains took place between 10:00 and 20:00. On the centre line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the centre line was ready to run one of four trains.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the travelers to travel.
The purchase chain Gallery Lafayette, which is 200.000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big businesses technically".
The line RER A moves through the Paris ballast area from west to east.
The RATP section connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of the two trains were planned to the main time of transport, and almost no one during the poor time of transport.
As already on Thursday, there was no human feeling on the hike, since the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had focused on the situation.
As early as the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) had run over much less than otherwise, especially because of the lack of gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) Jack explained Nbakina, engineer (29), he would be extra "a half hours earlier to get to work".
The SNCF, which had planned the care of travellers by employees and ordinary forces, pointed out that there had not been any breaches at the Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haud arrived or drove across the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strugglers were again held, and the results that the associations had been reviewed after the meeting with the leadership headquarters on Friday afternoon were "sufficient".
The RER manager proposed the specific development of a protocol for RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, professional courses, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they demand a long-term wage allowance.
The CGT was upset that the RATP itself puts its wage proposals in brackets and emphasized that the leading point "is not able to solve a problem, while this was possible for the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that there was a new meeting for the "great review of working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership point that until the date rejected any discussion during the strike, and attended a meeting after a relaxation of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to line RER B after an infringement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage allowance from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euro variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, where millions of travellers are travelling daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have many years of professional experience, have a breakdown loan of EUR 2.200 to EUR 2.700 and a wage allowance of EUR 600 to EUR 650 for shift services as well as for sun and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Curdian party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the pro-Curdian chief party of the country; a decision followed to the promptly angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the government’s work enormously difficult, endeavouring to reach the Kurdish community in order to end the conflicts for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved, as it had become a "State for activities which are disadvantaged for the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", said the President of the Constitutional Court of Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would be adopted unanimously by 11 judges, whereas a majority of seven votes would have been required to hang the resolution. In addition, he pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including the Chairman Ahmet Turk and the parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for the period of five years.
The judge also announced the suspension of parliamentary immunity, which enjoys Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confirmation of the parties' goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The leaders of the parties expressed their opinion in front of the judgment that the parliamentarians would prefer to leave Parliament rather than to meet as parpartose parliamentarians.
The decision followed a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP to follow the "Weises" of the Worker Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political acting window of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that "no connection" to the PKK will be held, however, refuses to call on the government to negotiate it as a terrorist organisation.
The judgment of the Constitutional Court works between the Government, who is endeavouring to meet the Kurdish Community and to propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to allow the support of the PKK to be seen by the Kurds and to end the conflicts.
DTP leaders confirm that a resolution could lead to a relapse of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of arrest of the PKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to conflicts with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the Court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered before the premises of the DTP in the millions of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is mostly populated by Kurden.
The routine forces set up tear gas granates and water vacuums when the demonstrators began to throw Molotovcocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Turk assumed that the decision of the Court would "deepen the distress."
"Turkey cannot clarify this question (Curdian, note, i.e. editorial) on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained the press.
The decision was also regretted by the government, composed of a party which was based on the Islamic movement.
"We are opposed to the closing of the parties in principle.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedization of the democratic opening supported by the government," says the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"It is obvious that you can focus on a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in the past months.
The snow invasion can come
A really broken winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not just because he wants to discourage the citizens, the winter service manager of the FES says.
Specially so that his employees can test and control the entire vehicle technology.
In the weekend it could be so far for the first time, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is carried out according to a precise plan.
As soon as it cuts surfacely in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A routes with large-stroke vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include main roads, such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fireways, ÖPNV routes, pedestrian zones and routes with casualties, such as the Atzelberg Street.
The service of the FES begins at three o'clock in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moisture that is better.
This is why the FES begins at three o'clock in the night, "to make the routes free until the professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult when it cuts only at 7.30 p.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make space for the scatter vehicles".
Only after that, if it is not further cutting, are the routes of supply and locking, including the Council-Beil roads, on the line.
The last priority has side and sideways.
There will be complaints, white Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES's soccer population is being put on the road, dangerous points and transitions.
For all cycling routes, the FES is usually unable to take care of.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps the bridges in the eye from 22 to 4.30 a.m., says Brauburger.
Since it is on this fast smooth, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is on the way.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The Ways of Dinosaurians
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-fressing dinosaurians: the two meters long and 1,50 meters large animal ran on two strong back legs, had a long skull with sharp, bowed teeth, short arms with silk crabs and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday magazine Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in today’s New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangéa at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relatives, the spread and characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began to grave on the Ghost Ranch in the north of New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones on one day, which is unprecedented for depots from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis of Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as new species.
In the course of excavation, they brought together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Found confirms theory about Dino-Frühgeschichte
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaurian fossils from the trias are extremely rare, mostly you find only single pieces."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but he confirms some theory about the early history of the dinosaurs, says about Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts discussed when the Echs split into their three main development lines: the meat-fressing theropods, of which later the Tyrannasaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, which were known as "long-healing" and their relatives, and the plants freshing Ornithischia (vogel basin sauriers), among which, for example, the species of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
He shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, at the skull of Tawa hallae, the researchers found evidence of air bags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than those of the mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had air bags and light-building bones, the common ancestors of both groups have probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive Dinosaurs so far lived in South America, the scientists follow that the eczess appear for the first time there.
Thus, the three development lines had been divorced early and spread from South America across all the continents, which then became a single land mass as a supercontinent of Pangéa.
For this, the fact that the team with Tawa hallae found the remains of two more, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot descend from a common migrant ancestor argue the researchers.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science Study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An older species, silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says Bonner Paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted image because in South America there are simply many primitive Dino-fossiles remained, while there is hardly anything to find on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant agricultural crustaceans of the earth's middle age, it is still ridiculous.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the forefathers of today's crocodiles and flight saurians and with many other ecsses.
By the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the relativeship at the border of the Trias was extinct to the jura.
Success history was not forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but not the other reptiles.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could hit the competition out of the field.
At least the success story wasn't forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite invaded a group of animals to blossom, which had also developed in the Trias, and since then induced a shadow: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto are on the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Doctors from Naples are there, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casinos of the Frankfurt Goethe University strikes waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also of universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarizing with the protesting students at the Campus Westend.
In a German and English explanation "missible" they have the police action caused by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had released the building occupied by students and teachers in the educational strip last week because walls and artworks had been decorated.
Five students were injured.
The damages, judge the signatories, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching events by students and teachers by a police command".
The space represents a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "delegation and criminalisation of the protest" and disregards the content.
The Bureau has withdrawn the necessary discourse.
The teachers are demanding the immediate establishment of criminal persecution.
The majority of the owners have not supported the damage, says it.
Protest legitimated
The youth of the trade union Verdi and the German trade union also solidarizes with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for your own future, says Verdi-Jugendssekreter Alexander Klein.
However, Hessens Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of university president and police.
We are grateful to the President-in-Office.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a recent hour on Thursday in Wiesbadener Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, as the CDU-Landday Member Peter Beuth said.
Otherwise, this saw the opposition fractions SPD, green and left.
The CDU takes painted walls as a premiere to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, it has been cleared.
The left has submitted an application that calls on the Minister of Inner Affairs to report on police action.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years she was considered a secret city, inaccessible for western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly guarded location in the Soviet Union for secret armor research.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 km from the centre of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro- and nanoelectronics are here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had contacted the Frankfurt Science Location Riedberg - with the universities and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "Protocol on closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow Vice-Citizen Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, signed for Frankfurt Planning Desert Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural scientific focal point will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
The FIZ's companies will be able to take foot on the growing Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian science companies want to engage in contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the Great Concerns of Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planstad" for armor research.
Selenograd (letterly translated "Green Town") received his name from the forest hill landscape where the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about the "new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the depth of a railway station, more than a monstrous building project that will crash the city of the baden-württembergische Landeshauptstadt for a decade in a salvationless building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 came from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headway stations with rails that ended in the middle of the city were then considered as traffic-technical fossils of the 19th century, which acted like brake cloths of a modern rail transport, as it once took a lot of time to span locomotives from behind to front.
Come on, hold on, go on, go, go, go.
And therefore, the main stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a doorway station located on the half-way of the trans-European rail magistrale between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "Heart Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost invaluable in the Hessian and Bayrian capital to implement depth.
Headway stations, however, have no more in- and exit problems since there are modern turning trains with motor vehicles and steering cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now going.
Country and local politicians have undertaken it.
The train is part of it, even because the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project of the Republic of Taxpayers and not of the State Groups are.
The project can be somewhat justified by urban construction.
There is a new city space, which - believes you the computer-generated graphics of the planner - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful for the transport system rail.
The tram station and the train expansion are intended for the passenger transport, which - typically the 1980s - was a huge growth.
At that time there wasn't the competition of the cheap flyers yet.
Modern transport policy must, however, first of all focus on strengthening freight transport, as transport on rail is much more environmentally friendly than by car on the road.
However, the new construction line does not work for freight trains because of strong rises.
Even more grave is that S21 indirect also takes many other railway projects.
Some six billion euros are to be banned in the Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It stands, in the next decade, the money will be missing at other nodes and anchorages in the network.
Totally sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the nearly 180 kilometres long distance through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the trace has been built at the time lupent rate.
It would be urgent to press right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rheintal route becomes the bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government verifies judgment on the airport
The country government has left open in Wiesbaden's landday whether it will go into revision against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH).
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to make the more than 400 pages of the VGH judgment legally examined, said Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had written that in the case of the construction of the planned Northwest Landbahn in the Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as the national government provides, should not be compatible with the legally mandatory protection of the population against nightlight.
The coalition must decide until 4 January whether it is against the judgment in revision.
The opposition criticized this suspension and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from an audit at the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The SPD fraction head of Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered as "writing".
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word, said Green Chair Tarek Al-Wazir in reaction to the FDP Wall Logan "We keep Word".
Minister Posch rejected the punishment of shepherds, trying the state government to come to their night flights with "justice and tricks".
A precise legal examination needs their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they showed the opposition, the statements of his group on the night flight ban had never been.
U.S. banks pay back help
The crises shocked U.S. large banks disappear their state fences.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid back the assistance from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund to a total of EUR 45 billion (about EUR 30 billion).
And the Citigroup also plans, according to a report by the US Sender CNBC, to reimburse state aid.
The institutions want to eliminate the restrictions associated with the adoption of the money, such as the limitation on the payment of managerboni and the remuneration of high fees.
The Bank of America had bought about $19 billion of fresh money for investors.
The remainder of the sum took it out of its own box, which was well filled by spare sales.
President Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money talks helped over a very difficult time.
The Money House had raised itself to the highlight of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market for exemption from its liabilities to the State.
Even on Thursday, the US Bank could announce a approximately $20 billion severe increase in its capital, CNBC reported on circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to say.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Quick Choice
Everything went faster than thought.
Shortly two weeks after the ZDF Administrative Board had pushed the official chief actor Nikolaus Brender out of the office, the transmitter may present a successor.
Yesterday evening, the Board wanted to vote on staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin, was a favourite.
However, there was no confirmation by the transmitter - officially in order not to interfere with the procedure.
However, it would also have played a role not to further damage the ZDF-inhibitor Markus Schächter, but should not pass through this proposal to the Administrative Board.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 Gremium members.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the conclusion of the edition of this issue.
Two weeks ago, with his proposal to extend the Treaty with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, Schächter was failed in the Management Board.
Only seven members spoke for Brender, seven voting against him. Brender's election was a heritage defeat for skakers, but a expectable one.
Because the majority of the Union in the Administrative Board had signaled weeks before the election to not want to confirm Brender in the office.
Organized the opposition to the Chief Actor of the Hessian Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that the ZDF's news broadcasts had lost at the rates of occupation, he rejected another term of office of the chief-looking chief actor.
Therefore, until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was cast.
Lastly, even 35 national lawyers were involved in the debate which considered the approach of Koch as constitutional.
It has nothing to do with it.
To the person
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied politics, educational and Romanistics.
Afterwards, he worked at the Southwest Radio and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey changed to ZDF, first to "this journal".
Following stations: 1988-1990 personal reference of the Chief Actor; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; up to 1998 Head and Moderator of the "Morgenmagazine"; until 2001 Head of ZDF External Policy; since the leader of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the selection of Brenders, which was selected on Wednesday by the Media Magazine industry as the journalist of the year.
Koch's counterpart in the Board of Directors, the Rheinland-Pfalz Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty in such a way that the staff proposals of the intelligence cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the ZDF Supervisory Boards also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended to the Management Board with a wise chess train - he strongly criticized the body immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both the chesses without face loss for the positions of the chief actors and the Board of Directors without suspicion of encouraging a participant to the office.
In the partial arithmetics, Frey is counted on the left-liberals.
Study Becoming Destroyed
Partial success for students: After a year of educational struggle, the Ministers of Culture of the Countries finally joined on Thursday: at a meeting of the Ministers of Culture and High School Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions in Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to cope with their study in the future.
In individual cases, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only complete with one single test.
In addition, the workload of students is to be reviewed and "a realistic and acceptable measure" ensured.
Politics and universities also want to facilitate the recognition of examination services between the universities within and outside Germany.
The countries undertook to make common structural provisions for bachelor and master studies more flexible.
There should also be no country-wide rules.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Cultural Ministers and Uni-Rektors have carried the vibrated word of better studyability in mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council decided to partially reduce the number of tests drastically: "Every module usually closes with only one test," is stated in a 30-page paper which is intended to partially re-regulate the authorisation of courses.
With the "decisive reduction of the test load", the accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm explained that a "failing development would be required to stop which significantly impaired the studyability."
In addition, the "studyability" will be the "decisive criterion" in the future.
Modules such as content are "restricted to check", whether "unnecessary entrances of students in the choice of
Events would be avoided.
Students would have "required to have gaming rooms, allowing and promoting their own initiatives".
The rules should apply when authorising new but also in the examination of existing courses.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, however, which means that it takes until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed.
For this purpose, 10 accreditation agencies in all Member States are subject to the accreditation council established by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had called on the countries "with emphasis" to influence the agencies so that the fills of substances are not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual countries, universities and universities have already agreed with the Ministry of Country on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Pfalz gave additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
The aim of the money is to set up universities, mainly, tutoral programmes and to strengthen study advice as well as auditing and foreign offices.
Country and universities want to spend ten million euros for this purpose.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring a novel of the law of higher education into Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
Study design is intended to become more flexible and to ensure the recognition of performance evidence at other universities and to facilitate access to master.
By the end of the next year, all courses of the country will be reviewed for their studyability.
Government and opposition had again disputed on Thursday on the conditions of study in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Chairman of the Juso High School Groups asked that the design of education policy should no longer take place "back closed doors" of the Ministers and High Schools in the future.
At the latest after the educational stroke, students should now also speak "a word."
Supported the future academics from the President of the High School Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Federation of Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough to the Bonn Decisions: it demands a legal right to allow each graduate with a Bachelor graduate access to a further master study.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that the current generation of Bachelor Students will have sufficient master studies places with the best possible terms of study, says GEW Governor Andreas Keller.
The countries need to set out clearly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on free access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Incoming in Germany and out is almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem of Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which these in disturbing language fetches the arrival of a dissident who won freedom, but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian banat, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a child book publisher before transferring to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded with various literature prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetics lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he is head of the Hessian literature forum at Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
On the last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, he took a considerable extraliterary view of "German literature in Romania in the mirror and decoration of their securitised acts".
Söllner is visiblely insecurified and leasing a statement in which he admitted his colleagues to Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, as an IM for the Romanian Secret Service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendants, Söllner had received the German language price in 1989.
The recruitment trials had begun swallowing, first in 1971.
I am, closed Söllner, "that is a person who hasn't defended himself enough against the Securitate's intimidation attempts."
The Lyrik Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Nearly at the same time as the Nobel Prize Honoration for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literature scene and, in particular, the Community of the German authors coming from Romania is shaken by a case that makes known the grounds and defeat of a political system based on monitoring and focus.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say, not only actors, but also victims.
In his Securitate Agte, IM Walter played a role, according to the confession of Söllner of the literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of the IM Walter.
He "screw him out in all the different points for him at that time," said Markel.
It would be a moral need for him to make this note.
Söllner's declaration was unexpected in the form and before this audience, but completely surprising is not the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate spits, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
In some cases, the subjects may be thought to be speculated and probably also knew what clear name was hidden behind the deck name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the very procedurally secure viewing of the Stasi acts in this country, the management of the rear-uses of Securitate monitoring is still very different.
A systematic information has been repulsed and handicapped in recent years.
One of the Birthler Boards of the corresponding National Council for the Construction of the Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was only founded in 1999, but the release of the documents has been more dramatic since then.
Only since 2005 there has been a law governing the management of the documents.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, following the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former Securitate-Chef from Temesvar deliberately spoke about the prizemaker.
She's got a psychosis, and finally they've only been interrogated once.
The infamity of power meant to express itself completely in the form of freedom of speech.
Surely, the case of Söllner, as is so often related to distorted debt, is inevitable.
Why only now? Who was damaged? The sensible reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more by knowledge than by debt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than one footnote.
Saturation Attachment Champions League
It seemed like a adrett dressed outside servicer from a very nice Christmas celebration on which a sports product manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, in accompanying an orange plastic of the equipment, increased a quarterly hour after midnight into a called C class. ̈
The man with the marking glacier was driving because of the city he was still alien.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol wasn't at last in the game, and the 55-year-old was so little sleeping for happiness.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work is just going on.
Or let's go right now.
In the words of the Swiss only three days earlier committed: "We have reached the eighth-finale," namely, in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let the success blind: it will be a brutal hard fight against the decline."
The "much more important task" is before Sunday.
Then, in Mainz, it is important to repeat the kingly class performance in the liga everyday.
And dispose of the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three gates by Marica (5th), Wood (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Dispensation
The eight-final of the Champions League (Hinspiele 16/17. + 23/24 February/Replay 9/10. + 16/17 March) is released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminating consensus of the Babbel follower remained.
Not only with the supposed healer who had communicated the insecure Stuttgart professional in the short time of self-confidence, use willingness and joy of game.
I went to the players and told them that they should think about their strengths, and stopped them to be more courageous, said the soul climber Gross the sounding success recipe that had no effect under the therapist Babbel.
He has evolved a certain magic, admitted Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann, "if a new impulse comes in the football, sometimes happens things that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week of injury break, announced the best player in the place, tried to describe the discovered "phresh wind" and the functioning of the new supervisor: "He is a man who takes through and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the present situation."
Under Babylon, it was evident that it had failed.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns Sportsman Horst Held
But the VfB Stuttgart needs most of the constance.
Like Gross, players and managers guarded against excessing the victory against a replacement weak and completely overrequired defense of Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awake gave Khedira to remember.
And Horst Held's head of sport reminded that although a seasonal target was reached, the other was still in a further distance.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that hero was not held after celebrations on his 40th birthday even after the first home victory for three months, was on the events of the weekend that were freshly experienced in the form of a TV interview by Torhüter Jens Lehmann direct before the start of the game.
There are decisions that make others, not the Jens, contended the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown the board of leadership weakness and decided to change trainer on pressure of puberting fans.
Also that his free day was deleted after games, Lehmann valued as signs of lack of sovereignty and misery.
Lehmann's statements were "perceived by pure egoism", ceiling heroes back and announced consequences for the final man.
They're not going to be friends for life anymore, the two forty years.
However, they agreed with all others that without preparing the training team, the playful and fighting strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a great share of success," said Hero and Lehmann unisono - and also the man with the plastic garments agreed.
WM-fight in gravity
Heated Duell in Bern: The Challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko provoked again and again with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title by version of the WBC.
The judges' judgment was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains Box World Champion in gravity.
The 38-year champion, according to version of the WBC association, defeated on Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson unanimously according to points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already two times the world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, the K.o, all expected, did not work.
Klitschko built his balance sheet on 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to be struck because of injuries.
Johnson's challenger had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
Before about 17,000 viewers in the Berner Arena, the 2.02 meters large Klitschko wanted to dictate the battle, especially with his left leader hand.
However, the 11-centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duell, repeatedly dealt with the world champion's struggles, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to the goal.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to come over the rounds.
He provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, but his strokes met the world champion rarely.
He was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had provided some twins before fighting in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "shocky zombie", which "nothing can be right."
During weighing, the champion was provoked on Friday to push Johnson the sunglasses from the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth Victory for Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth battle after his Comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of expiry, he had struck the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and returned his "his" WBC belts, which he had had to deliver in the past.
This year, he rejected Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I only got a hit in this battle and is physically very good in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return into the ring.
But his dream remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is World Champion of the Associations WBO and IBF.
But the belt of the WBA wears the British David Haye, after he was able to throne the 2,13 meters large Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had previously canceled a planned fight against Vitali Klitschko in September in the summer.
It seems that its promotional company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in the London Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin called Defence Minister Guttenberg for false information about the Kunduz business as a liar.
SPD and left demand information from the office.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings on the Air Attack of Kunduz, the opposition defence minister Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) has undergone a conscious misleading.
The minister said to the fatal bombing event on two tank trains from September "scientificly the falseness," said Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news release "Day Sight".
It is called the countryside: he lied.
The order to kill had been issued in disregarding the rules of the International Army of Protection for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that the NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it had become known that the attack was not only a destruction of the kidnapped trucks, but also a goal of killing two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. Air attack requested by the German Kunduz-Kommandeur Oberst Klein was killed or injured by up to 142 people, according to the Nato investigation report.
On Saturday, Green, SPD and Left asked Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) to comment immediately before the Federal Day and also to explain what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghanistan policy of the Federal Government - and whether the Kanzler's Office, the Federal Army and the News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green Collegin Renate asked for a short time.
Government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm decided to reject the criticism.
The Office did not influence concrete action by the Federal Army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the presentation of the Ministry on the backgrounds of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert were also raised.
According to the SPIEGEL information, the two Guttenbergs have informed correctly and fully about the backgrounds of the Tanklaster attack.
Officially, they had denied the existence of the Nato reports and held sensible details to the minister.
From the environment of the two top officials, however, announced that they had even referred to the Defence Ministry to several reports, including a two-sided document of the commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunting report.
In the meantime, Wichered was supposed to have asked in a letter for clarification of the fact, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, says it.
The Ministry did not comment on the claims on Saturday and pointed out that this was cleared in the Federal Day Examination Committee, which wishes to construct itself on the next Wednesday.
The dream world
Some see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in psychiatric illness and in drug noise, the limits between imagination and reality are diminished.
As long as it happens in sleep, it's all right.
If we lie in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can devote ourselves to the wildest ideas and imagination.
But whoever experiences traumaous conditions in the wake, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world is usually considered crazy or drug addiction, at least as a specialist.
However, such pictures and voices are not only in psychiatric illness or in drug noise.
Our imagination is our fault: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make sure that the limits between dream, madness and reality are faded.
Traum-like changes in watchconsciousness may occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case wrath.
Even though triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard from Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Practices Carlos Castaneda, Shaman depression, psychosis and hallucinations, can lead to similar processes.
Hallucinations or disturbances occur when the balance of the neuronal agents of the brain - all in front of dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholine - is eliminated and the interaction of different brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and disgusting thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him anymore
The link of madness and dream has been working philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristoteles understood hallucinations as a form of dream in awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatric Psychiatrie, in 1861 found a "great similarity of irrration with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconveniences, insane forms, senses of such ones".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turned into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and silent.
The gravity has no more power over him, he's swinging on the room deck.
He feels a trip.
Behind him, devils fled with bloody red, distorted frats, twisted.
They hunt him, hit him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pains on the whole body.
Noise, bad voices dry from walls and radio.
He can't endure them anymore, the voices that insult him and insult him.
Henning T. screws two cables out of the star plant, knobs it to a trap and attachs it to a crochet on the roof.
He rises to a loudspeaker and puts the trap around the neck.
Jump.
The strike is loose.
This is to be a teaching to you, crying the voices in the thromboeful choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself heal!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoide Psychosis, also it is manic-depressive, he takes medicines, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his disease, he's been married for three years.
In the psychosis I've experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The trug images are cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population is sick at least once in life of schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, the affected can usually no longer distinguish between internal and outdoor worlds, they are in a superior state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Particularly widespread is the voice hearing - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also rare.
The affected person is no longer able to separate important things from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is overflowed by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the sleeves for a flood of ideas and imaginations, the deeper consciousness layers.
The reality in the Psychosis is subject-centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Oberärzt der Klinik für Allgemeine Psychiatrie in der Universitätsklinik Heidelberg.
The Shizophrene is located in the centre of the event, everything has a focus on it.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he is, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot make them active.
Shizophrene therefore often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balancing is usually not possible for them, the fraud pictures are cruel reality, wake up excluded.
Once in life a hallucination experienced
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sense and spatial structure of the reality that is perceived in the psychosis remains fundamentally maintained."
The miserable thoughts and hallucinations are found in reality, the promotion of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why our brain strikes capriols, researchers still present puzzles.
Exceptional conditions can lead to the short-term loss of reality in every person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic layout for schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the solely determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damages in the case of affected people.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example, by a mother's virus disease during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery of how the neuronal system is disturbed, which does not even manifest itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis when the disposition is available.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain goes hot
The crazy thing is, psychiatrists suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines to get rid of them, others spend money for drugs to get what, the liebecker psychology professor Erich Box says.
It is often only a question of the view whether the fraud images are considered pleasant or unpleasant.
Box has collected reports about hallucinations and threats for ten years, last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The irregular world in our head".
Hallucinations include the typical companions of Psychosen, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
In addition to psychic disorders such as borderline or depression, these include often illnesses such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or alzheimer and pearl brain traumata.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain of healthy people is hallucinated.
Hallucinations, according to box, are composed of memory content, which are usually retained.
They occur when the Hirnareale, in which senses are processed, are overactive or too minor; if our brain runs hot or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also riding, stress, love shame or other mental exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents indicated that they had at least once in life experienced hallucination.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visits the gymnasium there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
In the break, it may occur that a sluggish boy with long, dark hair talks about it.
If it answers him, the students look surprised at it - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
You think the shocked girl is a sponsored day dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
It can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
I'm crazy?, she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other trumpets aren't real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are most distressing
Often the fraud pictures are also a burden.
If she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material because the teacher in her eyes and ears just presents a new student, while explaining to all others hearing and visible on the table mathematical equations.
At night, the appearances are most distressing.
If she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is too rare and too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreams of the pictures she sees, the frats or the girl with the bloody cutting wounds on her arms and legs, appearing before her open or closed eyes.
Let me alone, she's crying on the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell her that they would think they'd be crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She lived with her friend last year and she lives with her.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Wahn is also an artwork of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from riding, he is likely to have hallucinations after a while, says box.
I suppose the brain is then under-occupied, and I'll take care of his own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl was afraid of other children, she often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Papa since she can think is not her physical father.
Since in visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain areas are active, which also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish fraud pictures and reality. "Every experience," says box, "that happens in the brain, the reality forms there.
Hallucinations are also pictures that cause the brain to appear, so they act so real."
Even nightly dream images consider box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not vary fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenes, psychological health are able to recognize their fraud pictures as irreversible.
The box therefore advises his patients to estimate hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our too consciously focused world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologyized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief of the Hospital for Psychiatrie and Psychotherapy of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A Psychosis is a severe, suffering disease, but it also produces positive, creative - male is also an artwork of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroide experience form, a special form of traumatically modified watch consciousness.
Oneiroides are high-complex, detailed quasi dreams that the experiencer considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the wake state in the afternoon.
The oneiroide condition of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience a motoric paralysis in full consciousness.
If a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with a own imaginary world disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to tackle a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is reflected in the imagination.
An intense form of intelligence and sense in an incompatible situation that enables us to be able to create our own ability to not fall into a non-consciousness loss.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness goes on trips after a cardiovascular surgery with subsequent heart transplantation for days, while his body is condemned to motionlessness at the intensive station.
Claussen is dying into a self-created world, visiting alien times and places: He experiences as a bedside, old man, on board a train laboratory, a robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among audiences, who produce noises from blood.
Located by a Greek on the motorcycle in its home country, surfing with his Spital bed in the Firnschnee of the Alps and hitting a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal travels differ fundamentally from any dream for clauses.
Dream is another condition, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of mental travels are overwhelming for me after years and in the nearest detail.
Clearer and more intense than real experience.
The intensity of this experience spreads the horizon of our other life-wide experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneiroides, psychosiss, hallucinations and drug noise show how brutal our inner images of the external reality are also in guard.
Any change in consciousness state, the psychologist recums, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow invasion can come
Burda
Children are to take the publisher at 27 years of age
The new publisher Kallen is a intermediate solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his company in the hands of his two children, he said to the SPIEGEL.
The holding is also intended to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children inherit with 27 years of age and have the strong will to enter the company, the 69-year-old said the SPIEGEL.
The details of this have been carefully regulated.
The question whether they are also active in the company is only after that.
The question whether they are able to do so.
You can't present 7500 employees to his children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
That kills the children and the company too.
On Thursday, Burda had announced that he would withdraw from the presidency of the Board of Directors from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for the company's assets came to it and after the exclusion of Jürgen Todenhöfer also those for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the publishing.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who today was 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to "brow over 10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should also be 100 percent of the family in future, says Burda.
With a view to the cases of kickedance and shaeffler, Burda said that family companies are not sure before the destruction: "There were always families that were inflicted by a capital addiction that had completely speculated and thought they could rise up to the very large player.
My strategy was never that.
He had no world power dreams, so Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Jumper, and I don't want to play with 'time' in the Worldliga, these shops have become too large.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least this is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a store store with a area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao, Madrid, where everything is only about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located in the eighth floor, you can find among other respected companies such as Hedonai, who provide an entrance with laser; spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and for beauty treatments; the hairdresser Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that shows through her tea house with more than 130 different tea varieties.
To enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner, while having a fantastic view of the capital, or to rent the relaxation area for two hours, to put your own "beauty party" with eight friends on your legs and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass champagne, these are only some of the many possibilities that Spaxisón offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest face and body treatments and for hydrotherapy.
For example, for the cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has these types of devices, and there are also virtual trainers who care for customer training units and thus offer them a perfect personal training.
You start a training unit by typing a personal password on a touchscreen that is located against the devices.
Next, you will show various videos how to perform your training units correctly.
The leader of the fitness studio ensures that 15 minutes (included heating and dizziness exercises) are perfectly sufficient to train the body muscles.
If then, after training your body, you want to overlook the hairstore, the Luis & Tachi company has a room in which treatments for re-establishing the hair practicing, glance and health are offered for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusiveity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10 pm early until 22 pm at night 365 days a year.
The most diverse Dekolletés
Christmas is getting closer and therefore it is a good opportunity again to copy the appearance of the stars and get their feast clothes in our clothes.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that need to be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has selected an excessive and very complicated decolleté.
Endsa and Barcelona with the electric car
The Endsa power company created the "LIVE-Buro" together with the city of Barcelona.
It is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the capital of Catalan.
The "LIVE-Buro" (introduction logistics) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and meet agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subventioning, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is to be developed for the promotion of electric cars and opinions and measures in the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport in the future.
3 "electrical cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
Endsa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include such activities that are related to energy and, in particular, their performance.
However, it is not at all the only initiative to take part in the endsa with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a Horizon of Rest" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied the Spanish automotive industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "a Horizon of Peace".
In the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again reminded of the measures that the government started to support the automotive sector during the year of the government.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we today have a panorama of negligence and the closure of some of our main production works," explained the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automotive manufacturers to produce in a highly competitive industry in Spain, we can see a quiet horizon for the award of this industry, which is our largest export sector," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which, on the other hand, provide more than EUR 3 billion for investment.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended for the development of new models as well as for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to boost demand, in view of the 2000E plan, which are applied in cooperation with the autonomous communities and the automobile manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows the emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by 6% in average, which led to a "strong growth" in authorizations that increased by "40%" in November.
At 20.000 square meters classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the international classic automotive fair is organised, an exhibition for experts and lovers of the world of engines.
This fair will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pabellón de Cristal of Casa de Campo in Madrid.
The exhibition area of 20 000 square meters 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands.
Not only classic motorcycles and vehicles can be admired, but also all the articles that can be found in connection with the world of engines at the ClassicAuto Madrid will be found.
Thus you can find accessories, spare parts, parts, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, mini-cars, etc. for the exhibitors on the fair.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classical engines that will enthusiasm the collectors and lovers.

Equality tests are also carried out with classic cars and motorcycles on a separately configured race track in the field of the fair area.
Mazda3 i-stop: Environmental Sports
Mazda wants to prove that sportivity is completely compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently introduced the automatic stop and drive system of the engine, baptized on the name i-stop, a device that is currently available only for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 appears through its good notes at the overall image.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its behavior, the mechanic, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are very good at the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seats, it can be found that the front seats offer an excellent ergonomic and good hold.
In addition, the game of the driver is excellent.
For further consideration of the unit consisting of the instrument table and the armature board, you can find that Mazda is located with a variety of buttons and switches in the viewing colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futurist inner design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, decline from the proximity of the German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which all want to be excessive.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can drive more comfortably with the car.
To all of this, a large-scale and clearly shaped baggage room comes.
The stop and drive system is currently only available for the 2 litre petrol engine with 150 PS and a 6-changing.
This engine is a real enjoyment. It evolves through its feed, through its quiet noise, its performances and by its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in walking and its low consumption, even if in Mazda, above all, the diesel models are most sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the sampling is a speciality, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
The serial extinguisher is mainly the assistant for the change of tracks (RVM), which thus eliminates the dead angle, but also the control elements for the traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive inner levels, the board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as the chrome 17-inch flags.
In addition, this version also includes, as if it were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable bixenon lighters and the sound system BOSE with CD loader.
Fazit
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars in his class.
It is particularly outstanding with regard to the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the diversity of equipment.
In addition, those who do not leave many kilometres per year can also buy the i-stop version, which is available only with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 PS.
The only negative on this model is a slightly high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 euros for the test-driven model Sportive.
However, as an equivalent to this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day on the new highest passport.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensibility for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is excessively restricted, a device that allows you to read only its emails, without an opportunity to see certain attachments or to surf through the Internet.
It enjoyed his five minutes of glory when it chose the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
It is more unlikely to see it on the Straße, but the idea itself is especially of interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example only half of the price of the flat rate of a iPhone.
After the company has seen the success of it, it has placed two new devices on the market: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a life-long free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as his American counterpart, however, has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about EUR 12 a month, includes roaming for all Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to avoid all the data to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the country border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of the roaming with flatrate is incredibly enticing and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for abroad, but after my experience, you already need a doctoral title in physics and a good glass to read all the small printed.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission regarding affordable roaming tariffs for Europe was almost always neglected.
In the area of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and that rightly.
That a small device like FonPeek (which it is always amazing that it has the name of Fon, although it has no Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariff, means that the telephone providers need to reconsider and start considering various possibilities how to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices, the download of books and further requests is included on the Internet.
Without conveyance and without hacking.
It is an Internet-capable device and one pays for it only one time, namely when it is purchased, and not a month for month.
And that's exactly what I'm expecting one day from FonPeek, a purchase option with lifelong Internet access as it already offers the Peek in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
In particular, I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
As President of the United States, they appeared in a dress and a mantle of this color when Barack Obama arrived, and have chosen the same colour again to accompany him with his, without doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the peace nobel price in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has carried very similar models at both occasions: auβer that it was almost the same color - a glanced green yellow - the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and dress of the same fabric, and for this it was wearing something largely sticked or a necklace.
It is even so that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress at more than one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the type of substance they are made from.
At the introduction, she had a dress of top and in Oslo of a patterned seed.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with semi-height paragraphs and for the second time a definite model, but gold colors.
Also the hairstyle was different every time: The hair was put up at this occasion as a hair crane, at the previous she wore the hair open.
75% of the occupational mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want children.
This results from the study "Fruchtbarkeit and Career of Women in Spain" conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey under 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt: 75% of the occupational women see their career opportunities on the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are large differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether women are working or not and, if so, what kind of profession they are doing.
Those of them who do not do any other work in the House only work for half a day or have no fixed working contracts are more mothers and have more children.
On the other hand, women with a fixed job, especially in the public sector, suspend the establishment of a family and maternity and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age with a fixed job get their first child in average only 3.7 years after the merger, an increase to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment, who have needed longer to achieve this, and who have joined her and the first child has only achieved much later.
In addition, the kind of work has a great influence on maternity, even less than the calendar with regard to reception," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is even higher, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also observed in women with the same age.
For example, women in the group aged between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they only have the primary graduation or higher education, were at average 25.1 or 32.1 mothers for the first time.
In addition, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While women are married with a main conclusion before their first festival and receive their first child, the women with a middle or high school graduation are doing exactly different and are looking for a finding and marrying after it and then get their first child, defining Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to the list of ambassadors who have been enthusiastic: Diane Kruger.
From the next year the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the widely known advertisement "Because it is worth it."
The main performer of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will become another famous cover, like before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones who joined this exclusive club were allowed for the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
For the men, the cosmetic company has only exceptional messages: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (People of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award of prices for the British fashion industry
The British have an important word in the fashion world.
Your highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today - met at the annual award of prices held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
For this reason they all appeared.
The ex model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, which was chosen to be the best model this year.
The poker game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Assessment" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) to the thirty X-ray pictures of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearful genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a fear of the glowing heartpiece of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not save any fears or lighting.
Auβer that this book is a delicious reader, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here's a few cuts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensible drive, just as I always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unhealthy fate, the moral without blame and the innocent without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegoric Christ, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between abuse and ignorance, with a thrilling poetic humor, without any sense, like the knives that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was brought into her ban by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that was to come into heaven on the way to corruption."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 summits in the worldwide literature, one has to climb up on the north wall, on the wall, where the best mountain climbs are always trying to get new."
About William Faulkner: "There was a funny cauz.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the inheritance of a good owner of the county, and again, he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams proved to a certain grave."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy cry from a bridge out of that personality from Munich, so that his echo was swallowed down to the night of the 20th century in his literary way. This he made during a journey on which he flew before himself and with a speech of violence in front of the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeped down and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses are engraved by Spencer: ' the sleep after the effort,/ after the storm of the port,/the rest after the war,/ after a satent life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her baggage she always had her depressions.
The husband took it with full normality when she told him that Eduard VII spioned it between the Azales or the birds sang in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotician whose literary talent was still much grewer than her crazyness."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos otherwise than trying to influence Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet mean when he didn't bring Baroja to Faulkner's weapons?
So what did Cela do, except to destroy the fame of that man, so that he could put himself on this podest?"
Fee aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our district last week in the town of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age lived next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixer that we picked out of the animal home and weighed just six kilos, and then they missed him two footsteps and hurt him hardly.
Our dismantling can't be seen in words, because it is impossible to understand where, as the fun of a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal is supposed to be carried out on the line.
This is still the incredible attack that a woman who walked cozyly received when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared her own life, for if such a crazy man attacks a dog, he may be the same with a woman, a child, an elderly master, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a usually quiet district of the city at five p.m. on a very common Tuesday.
The dog's been crying all day.
Of course, we have advertised in a nearby police department, but we have great doubts about whether this will bring something at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to clarify that the figs of criminals were Spanish.
Our dismantling over the event has led us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what must happen in the heads of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on a animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for the animals and the persons remained.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for the use of the helmet
In collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), the tyre manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially in the younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies today announced.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of an engine bike accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport security, which "more than merely covers the design and manufacture of products that become more and more safe every day" and further confirmed that it also contributes with other actions of educational and informational nature to get closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, running under the Slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and just because they are always compulsory as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, which must be one of their main goals to develop ever safer products.
The sale of small cars rises a bit again
After almost two years the car market for small transporters finally begins to see a little light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in reference to the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first growth at all after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, with the figures presented by the manufacturer's association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are at present only with great caution, since the reference data used for comparison from November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a fall of 60 % in respect of the previous year.
However, it must be noted that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months remain 40 % below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January there have been a total of 95.853 vehicles sold, but in this number all vehicles consisting of the small transport market are included: offcomers of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small supply cars and lighter cars/cars.
Furthermore, there are still the same weather clouds in the sky, which make the demand the most compassionate, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private persons, the large proportion of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, who in nearly 100 % of all cases do the purchase with a third-party financing.
For these restrictions, which are the result of the turnover of the credit institutions, you must also include further factors, such as the increase in unemployment rates or the duration of the poor economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, financial support has helped little to buy a vehicle from the 2000E plan.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, but also for self-employed and small businesses is entitled to buy a small transporter up to 3,5 tonnes with a CO2 excess that may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday again, Ganvam had reminded that it is essential for the State to focus on these small loaders as well as, of course, on industrial vehicles (cars and buses).
The car merchant association for 2010 predicts a year similar to the previous year, for which it is expected to have a sale loss (for passenger cars and terrain cars) of 19 %.
Support for brake maneuvers in critical situations is now obligatory
As the anti-blocking braking system ABS at that time and as it is now happening with the ESP stability control, the aid systems must become a mandatory equipment in the European cars for braking in emergency cases.
In fact, they are already obliged to all newly approved passenger cars and light small transporters, for the remaining vehicles a carding period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measures adopted by the European Union aim to improve the protection of fusion users, but these brake systems can also help to prevent many accidents.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exercise more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake maneuver that recognizes the system based on the brake strength carried out by the driver on the brake pedal.
However, this system does not exercise this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation carried out by the Bosch vehicle component manufacturer, one third of the drivers in an accident were no longer able to enter the brake meadow before the congestion and half of them had not braked with full power.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the other hand, the brake aid intervenes with maximum power in the brake system and thus reduces the brake time and thus also the brake distance that a car reverses during the brake operation.
According to a EU study, up to 1.100 fatal accidents in which mergers are damaged could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would even be fewer accidents - one is expected that every fourth accident could be prevented by personal damage - once the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that recognizes obstacles (via radar or camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exercising a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake spedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the congestion is inevitable, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the occupation of the Opel-Werk in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) was already informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first April week, probably on 8 April, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer pointed out that it takes more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the affected side already agrees on each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which is first presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM will ensure that a decision on the sale of Saab will be taken in the next days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American automobile builder to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to be in contact with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the Dutch manufacturer's option of the Skyper port car, which has back coverage from the Russian Converg group, wins increasingly stronger.
If none of these buyers should reach an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to sleep with Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
At the control of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the boxster S as the basis and really made it easier to make it easier for 80 pounds, with which he now brings only 1,25 pounds [1,275 pounds] to the scale.
In order to create such a thing, they first rejected the automatic unfoldable roof, which was replaced by a tent linen roof by manual drive, so that one alone spared 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3 "sweep" further 15; by the removal of the air conditioner 13; by the removal of the air conditioning system, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 litres, so that another 7 kilos were stored; by the installation of sporty bacquet seats again 12 and with the light 19-inch trails again five.
Then, by the absence of the audio system CDR-30 again, six kilos less and by the exchange of door handles from material, the missing kilos had been reached.
Although it is also available with the double connector PDK, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-use hand drives, mainly on the smaller landways of California, on mountain lines that truly survived very curved.
In his driving behavior you can only give him the note in vain.
However, the reduction of its weight has not resulted in the fact that it would no longer be so safe on the Straßburg.
It is rather the opposite of the case: since long, we have no longer tested such a small and light model, which, at the same time, also gives you a feeling of greater security in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low walk in the time required until we give him the commands to rush, brake, recover and then get back to the new everything out of his engine ...
He does everything you tell him. The car does everything we're doing to him with our hands on the driver, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as precise as well.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has been excellently successful and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise that has already been used at Panamera for the first time.
The acceleration ability is incredibly brutal, regardless of whether it stands out or when it accelerates again.
The feathers are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the Landstraβen, on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder, was quite damaged, but the car mastered the sleeves well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route; and that although we found ice at some of these curves in the morning grey and roll split in the morning.
As a summary, it is an ultra-slight car, a car with which you have an inscriptive driving passport, as it may be more rare and in it is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be marketed in February 2010 and cost 70.831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetic line Coco Cocooon and an occasional starlet in the fashion views of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck starity as her pockets of Chanel.
A lot more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
Basconia gives himself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 in his visit to the complicated Fuβball field of Maccabi Electra and thus come to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, which was with eight three times the best of his team (29 at the rating).
The team from Vitoria could replace the significant failures of Mrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of use and team work, even if they were to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits from the perimeter out with 16 evaluated three times contributed to their final victory.
The game started with the leadership of the blue reds, which set themselves on the top of the display table from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the crew from Vitoria came out of the perimeter, it was already possible to admit that they had come to the playground with well-heated hands.
It was English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava decided to play a inside game by Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received at his return to the crew with pepper and applause, which is his home to expand its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" rating of splitter is already admitted that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Yet, despite the clear advantage of the break, the game was not yet decided and the Mackabears wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that on their field, not everyone wins, and thanks to the ever again-attractive "Hand of Elías" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini decisively contributed to the turning of the "yellows" the rod (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but everything other than dead, had to prepare a few games with meeting security to get back air and one of them suddenly came to Mirza Teletovic's gun, which with three almost consecutive three-folds and with the support of English and Ribas, provided that on the advertisement table was displayed a relaxing distance from (54-67) which the host could exhibit at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaves were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they earned in the first thirty minutes honestly.
Nonetheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their teams did not and tried to restore their crew by three points from line (70-77).
Yet, and although splitter was put from the place because of fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defend himself well and although the Israelites were still picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being commanded
Unicaja lost in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in the group B of Euroliga to him, and that was marked in a game that was characterized by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the interior game, which made the Greeks facilitating the victory.
The malaga team was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship or of the opposition team, which is perhaps one of the strongest Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their first quarter game, the Andalusians were allowed to begin dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them through Omar Cook and one through Guillem Rubio, the host blinded at 12-18 in the 9 minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of unicaja, even though the local team with an interior game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis was able to show the advertisement table for their benefit in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute in which, due to an action, it had almost come to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to finally get warm and his superiority on both sides of the game, while the excretion of the English Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez himself left clear traces at Unicaja.
Among their players in the interior field and the Lithuanian foreplayer Linas Kleizas, with its three-fold, they increased their advantages in the 19th minute to 44-32.
An upholstered hunt was impossible
The third quarter of the game was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, proved superior and even made it possible to compensate for the difference of the game carried out in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27 minute, which, again, brought the lead within the group into fluctuations.
Unicaja tried to get away from the many failures and the excretion of the injured shot Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the three-fold of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope of 66-57 came back.
Yet it was actually impossible, since the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centuries within the basket area, was not to brake.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic created it in the 37th minute to allow the basket difference to rise to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be struck and had to take the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your profile in Facebook?
Facebook users are now able to learn their salary, which they should earn because of their profile, thanks to the new application of Trovit, the search engine with most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the user's salary on the basis of more than 140.000 jobs available at Trovit in Spain. The users are available a form in Facebook where their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish employee in average feels "bad paid," explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmerer receives an annual gross rate of 45.226 euros and a franchise of 31.059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros that a Spanish man deserves.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net content of 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the most poorly paid work in Spain is the net of a cellar with EUR 11.592 per year; followed by the work of a seller with EUR 14.725 and of a worker with EUR 15.667.
The most searched posts in the Internet in the last three months are one driver, half-day posts and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a departure date
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its message in Tegucigalpa.
The President withdrawn from the Office must leave the diplomatic representation at the latest on 27 January 2010 if his mandate is officially out of service
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must have left the message that he had found since 21 September asylum before that date.
"He is convinced that he has to go on January 27, as his mandate goes on this day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The transmitter also quoted the former president who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the fixed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back covering of the government of Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (which showed Porfirio Lobo as a winner) Zelaya assured that he would stay in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried this week to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed to refuse Zelayas to recognise the status of a asylum seeking politician who wanted to force him to "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you!
After the most attractive days last spring, when the inflation of the assets was the dominant atmosphere on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no case surprising, as this is its natural condition, in an environment where the makers make decisions on a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly allow the liquidity to be free at interest rates that are moving around zero, so that the banks buy assets to calculate.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct sales of assets are as well ended and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, start to spread some sand into the gear, as the BCE has already predicted with its annual auction, the next week.
Therefore, the investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are just witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The refugees of the stock exchanges and the differences in business bonuses are rising again, even though they are far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to state private risks and to increase government debts again.
You are now reposing on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which, again, leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the Eurozone in terms of Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision with regard to the evaluation of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to bring the defenders of moral risk to silence, who had again attempted to create a consciousness of the world economic policy responsible for what they had caused, since they had reduced the devastating effects to which the limitation of loans to the loss of jobs, when they should have actually entrusted a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates, and the development in Greece was also predicted earlier.
A government that dismisses government debt, elections and a new government that draws the same emphasis.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sokrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It doesn't make sense that Ecofin Hungary is rescuing from the non-compliance of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus granting a Euro Member State no longer to comply with its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and its citizens to take action in order to maintain the stability of the state money in the need of autience.
Yes, we are as expected before a episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excessive amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same speed as the European company bonus.
However, if European differences were to decrease and the Spanish continued to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a farce. While the preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutions to prefer their scenarios for recreation and to correct their scenario up for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, who will come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this promises no long lifetime, despite warnings.
Once again it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment it is "serve in driving".
Connected branches
The Chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, appeared first yesterday before the Subcommittee of Parliament, where in these days the strategy on the supply of energy in Spain is discussed in the next two decades.
After his appearance, on which the Chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, followed, Galán of the press gave some points about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion from this date until 2030, subject to the prerequisite that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this was not the case, the investments needed would be not 60 billion but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it is no longer to invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international associations.
As from 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for the capture of carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW is needed more, under the prerequisite, of course, by other "supportergia".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been adopted by the government, is on a line with what his company has called for, in no case wanted to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "there was made clear in this direction in the long term, despite some" individuals", as she referred to as the Chairman of Iberdrola.
Be it as it is, Galán believes that you should already take the decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, because it will need some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to attack them.
Ferrovial gets "Handling" from Aer Lingus to ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at ground airports, the Swiss Swiss port, is the preferred partner of the Irish flu company Aer Lingus for baggage services on ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement which has not yet been published has been set up to five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castilia-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares, signed yesterday a protocol on cooperation for the creation of a Innovation Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure.
The alliance plans to invest from 20 million to 2012, of which 50 % will be from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the examination of the energy efficiency of motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and Bouygues for his first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the approval of his first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately EUR 1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to set up in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city management wishes to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration had decided for public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project after a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and Maut Management.
In the expectation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to $1.7 billion Australian (1.047 billion), competing with three consortia, especially from European construction companies, in the last phase.
The group named Transcity is directed by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second is one of the best deep construction specialists in Italy.
Contrary to the Acciona team, the Consortium Northern Direct, is formed from the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for the infrastructure and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and last consortium, which is in closer choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the daughter company of the German construction company Hochdeep, which belongs to ACS), also the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, who specialized in public construction.
The Australian Infrastructure Market promises massive construction and privatisations, but it has a barrier to overcome because only the purchase of a local construction company will allow you to join.
A strategy that has been followed by those companies, in addition to Asian references, and which must only be followed by the Spanish constructors.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market by its participation of 30% in high depth, owner of the abovementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is very important in this geographical area for the sector where it is already known as a energy provider and in the dissolution industry due to its activity.
Among other assets, it has already its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads to the group of companies who were assigned to build and manage the Adelaide dissolution plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to obtain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground wall line, which is promoted by the Office for Infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and the Northern Link (North Resident) is designed to link the western motorway in Toowong to the surrounding road in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 kilometers through tunnels. It is the largest measure for stair-reducing on the streets of Brisbane.
The charter issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this wall section is already intended to open for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is assumed that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two driving tracks in each direction, an electronic wall system and a complex ventilation system.
Queensland's government participates in financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For the high-depth, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia forgives considerable contracts with the government of 154 million, which were signed yesterday.
The sub-corporate ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with a glass fiber cable through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create a fast Internet access for 400 000 people and occupy the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower's construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet started and the high depth has received 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, Manchester, it also competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools to 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has been able to build a tunnel over 2,1 km long for a motorway in Slovenia over the total of 64,5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the allocation for building work to extend the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens his experience in tunnel construction.
The beginning of the construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has allocated the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the Sra Agency. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company informed.
This contract also provides the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore has been selected among 16 agencies presented to this competition written by Renfe, 4 of which came to the end, among them TBWA, who was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be charged with the design and production of campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom due to the excursion of competition.
France Télécom has imposed a penalty over EUR 63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas in France.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers at the edge of regulation.
Together with this penalty, the former French monopoly and state company have collected more than 560 million euros in punishments since 1994 because of their disabled competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority guarding the competition considers that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and is therefore reverted.
Trade in application
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company followed the example of other telephone providers and opened an application trade page on the Internet for increasing revenues which are not derived from the telephone connection.
In principle, this application website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until this quest will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476,4 million.
The Champions League has developed its origin in 1992 as a source of revenue for the Fuβball club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476,4 million since then, which brings them the third and fifth place of the Fuβball clubs that earned most money in the liga.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
Leader of this list is Manchester United.
To win the Champions League of UEFA does not only bring commendation with itself. It is also one of the main sources of acquisition of the large associations.
According to the UEFA, up to 5.362.5 million euros have been distributed to the 105 teams (of which are 12 Spanish), which have participated in this event since its foundation in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is located at the third place of Europe, who earned most money through its participation and who, next to AC Milan, won the only one three times the tropical.
The official Catalan master and last winner of the former Europecup in 1992 is the fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also took the most money through their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in the third place of the countries that could make money through the champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, in contrast to four bie Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated financial allocation procedure applied by the UEFA.
In this financial year, the organisation, whose chairman Michel Platini has entered, accounts for revenues of 1.090 million through the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 Fuβball clubs who participated in the qualifying round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.3 million.
In addition, those who struggled to participate received 3.8 million through their bloat presence, in addition to the 550.000 euros for each game they struggled.
There is also a bonus for gain (80,000 euros) and for an unequivocal (40,000 per team). The clubs that have arrived in the eight-finals receive three million each; the four who have arrived in the quarter-finals are 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a Fuβball club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million of fixed income.
Barça again earned 2.5 million in August with his victory at the European Supercup.
However, there are still variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money will be allocated proportionally to the value of each individual TV market.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has 4 places allocated.
The last year's master receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group had the details of the purchase offer of shares in yesterday, with which it wanted to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29,9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In the concreet, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, paid to ten years and with an interest rate of 1 % annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos-Accounts closed by EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa assesses the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jerez group gives the shareholders a 15-day period to inform their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had been in contact with the Authority.
At one conclusion, the deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to structure its management.
When the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar were trying to stay at the edge of possible purchases and the judicial crossings of his ex-manager, they announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as the leader of the internal book review.
A decision making her the first woman who has a high position in the food business.
It is a newly created post which is directly subject to the Chairman of the Group.
This is everything but free of polemics, because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspicion of redirecting more than 230 million of Sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Sos moves more capital over the next months.
With regard to the loan of the Salazar yesterday, the ex-consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the movement of 212 million without their deliberation.
CNMV approves the public exclusion invitation of Paternina submitted by the Investment Company Mer
The National Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion invitation for Federico Paternina submitted by the Investment Company Mer last 9 October.
The supervisory authority declared that it approved this tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions comply with the legal laws and thus the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted, following the amendments last 2 December, could be considered "sufficient".
CNMV also announced that this offer aims at the acquisition of 55.000.08 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which is 8.95% of the capital of society, comprising EUR 6.142.786 in shares authorised on the markets of Madrid and Bilbao.
Auβ also has been announced that 5.592.778 million shares have been fixed which cannot be transferred until the conclusion of the tender and the price of Federico Paternina has been fixed in accordance with the legal laws.
New vehicles monitoring programmes
In these days of inmates and accidents, not only the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged into the workshops where a consultant has to assess the damage caused and the repair costs.
No single accident is equal and the calculation of the costs for the parts and hours of work can be a long-term and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between EUR 20.000 and EUR 30.000 by hand, including the parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a question of minutes
Therefore, almost 100 % of the consultants use this type of systems.
The service and application providers for the evaluation of accidents and maintenance collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group of Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are produced with their products.
The two other companies competing on the tool market for monitoring and drawing up a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is everything other than easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, the sales manager of Audatex, is cooperated with 63 manufacturers and importers, each of them provides the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed will be increasingly larger until the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engineering came on the market than in the past fifteen years.
Once a new car comes on the market, the work starts for the companies.
It is a durable task, because each of the but thousands of vehicles must be catagolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model generates a "intelligent" graphics on which you can "click" various parts of the vehicle.
If this is a very sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure is accelerated quickly.
