Fire deleted in French chemistry
The big fire in a chemical work that is particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been deleted. This informed the prefecture of the Normandie on Friday. The fire was broke out in the night on Thursday. Nobody was hurt at the incident. The fire war was in use with about 200 cleaning vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
The buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and children's gardens were closed on Thursday. In the chemistry work on the shore of hisses, additives are manufactured. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by the US-miljard Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
In the work, about 400 people work. The chemical factory already in the past provided hit lines - about when 2013, by a leak, the gas methanthiol was eliminated and the surroundings were largely smoked after faulty eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flow into the city's wastewater system.
Woman cancels her job to search 57 days for her disappeared dog
For two months a woman from Washington was looking for her lost dog - and announced her job for this extra. The seven-year-old border Collie was pulled out of the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days from the pond was missing every trace - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I got bad," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Then when they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone away. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had paniced a dog
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee said, "It was gone about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately run out. Probably a loud donder had put the dog in panic.
With Flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But from days on, they were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced their job as a post employee to continue their search for Katie.
"Float the tears"
57 days after Katie’s disappearance, Carole King got a call: A man reported and said that Katie was in his court. But when King arrived, Katie was already gone again. She was looking for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her handy under a tree. "I just got her armed. I didn’t want to let her go," King said, "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flow. People stopped in their vehicles, went out and armed us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found them."
Losses at the Federal Army: Machine guns disappear traceless
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six type MG3 machine guns are still disappeared.
In recent years, the Federal Army loses numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shot ammunition, including three machine weapons. In most cases, the opposition speaks of a "angry" scale.
In the Federal Army, weapons and ammunition are always disappearing - many of them are so far loose. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has booked the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and nearly 20 000 shots ammunition. This is the result of a listing of the Federal Defence Ministry, which the German Redaction Network reports.
According to the paper from the Office of Defence State Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one armpiece and 3474 shot ammunition have been reappeared. The disappeared weapons and parts of the arms are, among other things, six type MG3, eleven guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns and two type P8 guns. In addition, there are no 30 weapons pipes of type MG3.
The magnitude of weapons and ammunition losses in the Federal Army is "angry," said the Left-Day Member Martina Renner. This would be so much more, since in the course of investigations hardly found anything again. The left politician spoke of a "difficult balance". Renner criticized that in the listing it was unrecognizable whether there was a disappeared ammunition also those who were found in the context of the investigations against the suspected federal war officer Franco A. "And that although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned because of the ownership of this Munition," said Renner.
Oil tanks "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after it was established by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tank "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data from Resolutely showed, the tank was in motion and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated in the United Arab Emirates.
The tank had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but first he remained in Iranian waters. From the redership it was said that one wanted to wait for an official message from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" was brought on 19 July by the Iranian Revolution Guards in Hormuz's Sea Road under the punishment of violation of security rules. However, it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary fixing of a Iranian oil tank before the Gibraltar belonging to Britain.
The road of Hormuz is one of the world's most important seaways. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have intensified considerably over the past months. Trade shipping was taken into the conflict between the US and Iran. There were several incidents with tanks and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of people in the Peaceful Revolution
In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizen Angela Merkel had taken the commitment of the people in the DDR, who had gone to the road at the peaceful revolution 30 years ago. Courageous citizens would have taken the DDR regime in vain, said Merkel at a festival of the Thüringer CDU Group on the coming day of the German Unit in Erfurt. The mayor reminded, among other things, of the occupation of the Stasi central. "The state security was taken of the horror," she said.
Musk pursues delivery record
Teslas Quartal may keep record ready. Despite delivery trees, there were last losses in the electric automotive group.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car group a strong boost on the stock exchange with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100.000 deliverys," Musk wrote to Tesla employees in an e-mail published by the "Electrek" branch blog.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musks newsletter. The challenge is to bring the cars fast to the customer. To this end, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible.
Investors liked that: Tesla's shares went with a plus of more than six percent from the trade. The course has no longer been awarded for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered up to 95000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this purpose, six-digit numbers are required in the current and next quarter. Especially the most favourable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the winnings margins. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
Puzzle solved: That's why we can't kiss ourselves
A type of brake in the big brain prevents people from cocking themselves. This found scientists of the Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they announced on Thursday evening. It also made progress on the question why children are so vigorously opposed to cocking only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the approaching of a kittening hand triggers to laugh before touching. This lies on a deep layer in the big brain, which already triggers the laugh at the expectation of the kitten.
According to previous research, rats reacted to "laughter" in the ultrasound area when they were cooked by humans. This "laugh" is communicated by the part of the big brain, which serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self - touch
So far, it has been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-removing and touching by others - so that people can't kiss themselves. But the Berlin researchers now found in the experiments on rats that the laughing as well as the activity of the whole brain is being suppressed during a self-removal. This is also the case when living creatures are bruising themselves. During the external touch and cheating by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse has been strengthened.
However, passing the self - touch and touch by others at the same time, should the laughing also be oppressed. This suggests that the brain of rats could not just distinguish between the self - and the touch of others. The new findings suggested that people can't kiss themselves because the self - touch activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats have also been trained to kitten themselves. Thus, they broke this initiative in the experiment early, sometimes showed refuge behavior or a frightening star. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of children. The ambivalence of the kittling is a behavioral reaction that is the same in rats and humans.
Disaster disappeared: Great fire deleted in French chemistry
The big fire in a chemical work that is particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been deleted. This informed the prefecture of the Normandie of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire was outbreaked on Thursday in the night.
According to the authorities, no health-threatening substances should have occurred. The samples taken do not give any reason to worry, as prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured at the incident. The fire Force was in use with about 200 waste vehicles.
Schools and children's gardens were closed
The residents were invited not to leave their houses. Constructions around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and children's gardens remained closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of the US-military Warren Buffett

The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by US-miljard Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in Parliament after the suspension of the compulsory break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country without agreement from the EU on 31 October, Brussels should not rely on his demand for changes to the Brexit Agreement. As he wants to do, however, it is unclear.
About Cox, who used for the rest of Britain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and again this country would be to carry out the EU exit." Cox had been murdered by a legal extremist during the referendum battle in 2016.
Oslo and Utöya's attacks are revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a Memorial is revealed on Saturday in Norway for the honor of the victims. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron roses. They remember the roses that had been placed by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the dome in Oslo.
At the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed - the roses were cast by people from all over the world, including survivors and family members of the victims. For opening, among other Kron Prince Haakon and Chronic Princess Mette-Marit are expected.
On July 22, 2011, the court terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first shot a car bomb in Oslo's government district and after the island of Utöya, thousands of participants in a holiday camp of the Youth Organisation of the Social Democratic Labour Party were shot.
Iran releases British Tanks
The UN General debate did not bring a solution in Iran's conflict, but now there is a problem less. The British oil tank "Stena Impero" held in Iran could stab in lake again. It could be a puzzle in the peace plan of Iran's President Ruhani.
The British oil tank "Stena Impero", held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Reederei Stena Bulk announced.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew now travels to Dubai for medical investigations, explained Reedereichef Erik Hånell. By lunch the ship left the Iranian waters. "Beautiful that it is over," he said to the Swedish television broadcaster SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called the determination of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolution Guards had set the tank on 19 July under the contemplation of disregarding the rules of the maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well in the circumstances accordingly, said Hånell. They would have behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and exciting situation in the past ten weeks. The redeedry is now working to bring them back to their families as soon as possible.
The British Government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar, after the "Stena Impero" was established: there was a supertanker with oil from Iran at the beginning of July, which was supposed to have been intended for Syria, to be put to the chain. According to the delivery, the authorities were dismissed against EU sanctions against the War Country of Syria. The reference to the ship had been received by the United States.
The Iranian spoke of "Piratery" and threatened with consequences. In the middle of August the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Resistances that it was about a exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" free, rejected London vehement.
The road of Hormus is one of the world's most important seaways. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil exports are shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have intensified considerably over the past months. Trade shipping was traced into the conflict between the US and Iran. Several incidents with tanks and drones occurred.
Behind the tensions between Teheran and Washington stands the nuclear dispute of both countries. The Americans cast the Iranian leadership to want to build nuclear weapons. Iran rejects this. The United States was in 2018 alone out of the international nuclear agreement, which would prevent Iran from constructing an atomic bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has undermined the leadership in Teheran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a more stringent and more advanced agreement.
Because of the dispute about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tanks in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the US is working on a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the Hormus Road of New York at the UN Full Assembly. With the "Coalition of Hope" initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran and the Arab Gulf States wish to ensure the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf without foreign protection powers.
India has a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predetermined as "war winner". In view of the criminal duties imposed by the American President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers are forced to rediscover in the People's Republic. Financial heads of Asian companies who consider moving their production from China into another country call India in an UBS survey as one of the preferred alternatives. This is not only the inequalities of the Chinese-US trade war. With a gigantic pool of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be created as a result of the creation of a major role in the globally degraded production chain.
But now India itself has been focused in Trump's focus. From Haudegen in the white house denoted as "Königreich der Zölle", America has withdrawn the trade advantages for 2000 products from the threshold country at the beginning of June. The United States inspects India prohibitively high duties and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the rices with India are freely an adjacent scene. In addition, America looks at the world's largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's power rights in the South Indian Ocean. In this background, a salvation of American criminal law against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who entered just a second five-year term, is likely to weigh in security.
However, the problem lies in another place: The empirically hardened These that open markets accelerate economic development, has a serious situation in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under modi. Its reformer aims mainly at the bureaucratic error, which in the multi-national state has been exaggerating any entrepreneurial spirit. Corporations now receive fast construction permits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a stronger insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the prerequisites to ensure that both companies with high debts seem to liquidate more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In India, economic optics have made a lot better in the first five mode years, but in trade policy this is not true. In order to protect internationally low-competitive companies from foreign providers, the national conservative government even created new barriers.
In the west, the modi of the Nimbus of the energetic reformer, who radically renews his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister only knows all too well what vocabulary western managers like. In the core, however, the "India First" Advocate never rebounded from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian firms from being forced to release anachronistic events and thus become fit for global competition. Business people who survive thanks to the defence of their industries, belong to the stam choosers of the Modis Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and congratulate this short-sighted policy.
Addition of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is to be attached to a report in Paris in the next week. The former Head of State will be found on Monday at the Montparnasse Friedhof in the south of the French capital, reported AFP under call on the Chiracs family. It will take place in close family circles. For Sunday, a public grief celebration was held in the Pariser Invalidendom, as reported by the media.
Targeted the competitors: Dabo is the first secret hero of the light athletics WM
The world's top was already at the goal when in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium, the world's top was playing heartwarming scenes. In the first race of the men over 5,000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to swallow dangerously. He could hardly hold on the legs, run in unhealthy attitude, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the west African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly interfered with him and supported him the last half of the stage round to the destination. However, the forces were still enough to stop the running armband watch after the target. As if the scene wasn weren't already kurios enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly pulled the attention of the collected journalists. Shakefuls he first wake out, didn't even want to talk about his hero's act. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only one suffering mate. And, however, he would only be proud to represent his country that was invited to the World Association. Under normal circumstances he shouldn't even start. "This is why I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this in the evening with stress - and much more intense than he would have thought. For this hero's act will be remembered. After all, Dabo's competitor Busby even left the goal and voluntaryly took the last place - more than five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Baraga, who won this precedence. It had not been used anything at the end, because only with much help the busby was disqualified at the end of the World Light Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying there in Lisbon, had arrived to set up a personal best time at the WM in Doha. This was done, according to official data at 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already once." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Million Mash: Egyptians are ready for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in the area of possible governmental critical protests. In the centre of Cairos, there was an increased police presence on Friday. Several U-Bahn stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir site were locked.
In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls and the mobile phones of pedestrians were partially searched for news and photos related to protests. Hundreds had been arrested, according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, it had come to protest with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. They were against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and misconstruction. A such open protest against political leadership had not been found in Egypt for years. The Spanish exile of Egyptian construction entrepreneurs and actors Mohammed Ali, who took the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million march" on central places in the country for today's Friday. Ali calls for a "Volksrevolution".
The number of arrests related to protests continued to increase in two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) (ECRF) counted more than 1.570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) as well as the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. Independently, these figures were not confirmed. The government also confirmed and commented.
Random arrests
Many people were "willingly arrested", "only because they were "at the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW informed on behalf of lawyers. In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, the claims against the arrested are sufficient according to their lawyers from "distribution of false information" to the membership of a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, were asked and searched for arbitrary passports.
HRW also criticized the censur in the North African country. Thus, the government blocks Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online dealer: Shipping dealers should be able to spend returns easier
For online dealers, many packages are lost. About 20 million returns land on the waste. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to spend returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the company could not be freed from the turnover tax on Sachspends, the Ministry declared a question of the Green Federation's Group, which reported the newspapers of the radio media group on Friday, but the dealers could put the market value of the incurred returnes so low that they would not have to pay any or only little turnover tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that the Federal Citizens were returning every sixth package in orders on the Internet. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the waste. To spend the companies would cost extra money in accordance with the current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate money as a turnover to which then turnover tax is applied.
Green Group Chairman Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Minister for Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to make it clear that companies can't evaluate products accordingly and donate free of charge to non-profit organisations. The companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations. This was not only valid for online trade but also for other businesses from fashion shop to construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The famous work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to be auctioned in the nearest time.
For industry, Banksy's work underlines "the reproduction of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic behavior characterized by animals and tribes". From Saturday, the painting at Sotheby's in the British capital is to be issued until it is auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated to EUR 1.5 to two million.
The work was first issued in 2009 in the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of Great Bristol, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29. At this time the work named "Question Time" was renamed to "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million.
Lastly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard exchange of battle with the opposition on Wednesday at the first meeting of the sub-house after the suspension of a forced break by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to carry out the two-shooted Brexit on 31 October, however, without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is mixed into the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted an image that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a mezzle. The work daily sees thousands of trucks and other visitors at the time of entry to the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a walk in the park
The violent verbal attacks by the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit-Resident in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the battle before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "travel in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy this. We will be out of the EU and we will win".
Johnson had attacked Brexit-Residents in Parliament in the past few days and put them to the people, among other things, "fraud" and accusations that he could put the Members in danger because they could be targeted by murder threats, he deceived as "Humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to get back to rest is if the Members would finally respect the British decision to get out of the EU, and it is not surprising that the people were excited that Britain had not yet been excreted from the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the charged mood, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called on Friday to retain. "We should talk with each other with respect," said it in a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kaschmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan re-uped the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict at its first appearance before the Uno-Voll Assembly.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India would be likely, said Khan on Friday at the Uno General debate in New York. "If this is bad, one hopes for the best, but is prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented that."
Since its independence of British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have led three wars, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers have dominated a part of Kaschmir, another part of China. In the beginning of August, India had withdrawn the autonomy status of the Indian Kashmir region and thus increased the tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrants in Cairo demand the fall of the Egyptian president al-Sisi.
Against the present protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand. It lets with sharp ammunition shoot on the population, over 2000 arrested people in prisons to the 60 000 political prisoners already inhabited there. Protesting in Egypt was never dangerous yet. But since the power takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything for avoiding a scenario as at the times of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspectivelessness and the feeling of being staggered by their own government led millions to the road. And this is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not manage, no matter how hard it is to deal with opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today every third party lives in Egypt under the poverty limit. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its values, the inflation rate is ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket has to decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also for the largest economic player. The military builds streets, houses, football stages, food and much more. This was already before el-sisi. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, including the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically it will always be when large parts of the population have difficulties to afford a bottle of water at all.
Tüv-Tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No "Showstopper" more for capital airports
Two months has been checked whether the complicated assembly works in the BER fire protection system. The operators are satisfied with the history, but the Tüv is not finished at the BER.
According to large tests carried out in the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is sure, Head of Supervisory Board Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the Control Board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completed test, but he also said that there are still defects in the terminal. "We have many details topics, but a real show stop we don't have." He assured that the schedule until the entry into service still contains buffers.
However, there are indications that the temporary reserve will no longer be too large. The construction display will now be submitted to the Bauamt during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year it was intended for this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies in power cables are still to be resolved; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the inclusion of the flight operation, it is necessary to continue to work intensively on the processing of the deficiencies," announced in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is not yet any release for all dubbels on which the cable trails hang. The head of the airport expects it to exist until the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the railway station under the terminal does not work satisfactory. The problems had led the project into another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking trunks that fall down at a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They drive too far down. 36 engines must therefore be exchanged. Then, at the beginning of the year, there will be new attempts with hot gas smoke.
Problems with fire protection and other wooden angels as well as planning errors delay the opening of the airport for years. Originally it should operate in 2011. The costs have risen from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros to open next year since the beginning of 2006.
Since the passenger rates in Berlin have been significantly increased since then, the managers plan to develop the airport. This is why it is intended to be at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the chairman of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Finance manager Heike Fölster switches to the German Railway at the end of the year, staff manager Manfred Bobke-von Camen is retiring next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Automatics for Drugs Bounced - Police arrests man
He needed money for drugs - and chased some machines in the Chemnitz city area for it! Now the acter is finally in prison!
Over the past two years, the number of broken cigarette and parking cars in Chemnitz and the region has increased considerably. There was a million damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police took a 33-year-old German on the Citizen Street and on the Further Street in Chemnitz.
Police speaker Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations due to the introduction of explosions of explosions in reality with a particularly difficult case of the stealing carried by the Chemnitz criminal police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-olds confirmed."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old chemnitzer has now conceived eight acts.
The police speaker: "He seems to have financed his drug addiction with the prey." Only four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomber had blowed parking tickets on the Civil Road.
The total injury is at least EUR 60 000!
The automated bomb is now in an investigation. The police investigations against him continue.
It can be thought that he was also responsible for further automated explosions in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Airhansa Group crumbs its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the middle of the price struggle with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Airhansa daughter AUA takes over the "commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed a press speaker of Austrian Airlines against the APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported about it.
The Vienna base of the Airhansa-Billigflugger Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. From the current seven Eurowings flights, four remains in Vienna. It takes the AUA from Yenner 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings-Personal. In Salzburg, three Eurowings-Jets will be stationed in the future, which will fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines for holiday destinations. Trails from Vienna to Germany are taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna is integrated into the AUA and the network planning, explained the speaker. The flight times are to be coordinated on connection flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen Vienna's turning cross and develop the decentralized transport from the federal countries.
AviationNetOnline says that Eurowings in Vienna are only "Production Company" for the AUA group sister. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the board product should be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, but pilots and air carriers are from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights launched under AUA flight numbers will no longer be completed in terminal 1, but as the AUA in terminal 3.
At Vienna Airport, after the Niki-Pleite, announced a price struggle. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced only on Thursday to raise the fleet in Vienna next summer to 16 planes. The Irish cheap flyer sent four Ryanair machines and crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which criticized the trade union as a circumvention design to the collective agreement.
The battle announcement by Ryanair-Chef Michael O'Leary that Lauda has overcome the AUA in five years answered on Friday AUA board Andreas Otto: "We remain the number one on the site, in five, six or ten years."

However, it is sure that the fortunation of the number nine of the British throne sequence and the real estate mogul becomes a similar great festival as the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Studies on Causes of Cardiac Disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for heart-carcinoma diseases. But what really causes a heart weakness or an infarction? Hamburg researchers want to look at the heritage of 9000 healthy and ill people.
About the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to find the causes of heart-crisis diseases more detailed.
The research project is the largest of this type in the German-speaking area, announced the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Kühne Foundation promotes the project with 12,5 million euros. From Switzerland the High Mountain Clinic Davos belonging to the Foundation and the University Hospital of Zurich are involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition include the essential risk factors for heart-carcinoma diseases. Genetic factors include the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only insufficiently known. Now the scientists want to compare the complete inheritance of 8000 healthy people with the one of 1000 former patients of the Universitary Cardiac Center at the Week.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the about 20 000 relevant human genes, possible disease-reducing changes in the DNA - called mutations - it was said from the clinic. Every year about 200 were added.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options, such as the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. Data could also benefit from researching other people's diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the university heart and vascular centre. New knowledge of interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer is possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kohne (82), also stressed the strong will to use the data also for the research of other diseases. The Foundation's clinic is currently dealing with allergies. Now on the medical campus there, a centre for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created and a professor for bioinformatics. For the reasons of his commitment, the logistics entrepreneur in Switzerland said that he had been operated in Hamburg three years ago and very grateful.
The bioprobes of healthy participants are from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, according to the Clinic, this is the largest local health study in the world. In the inheritance decryption is strictly respected for the protection of anonymised data, scientists insured. It is about a Petabyte (1000 Terabyte) of data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zürich.
The inheritance of a human can be decoded today according to the week of 24 hours. The pure cost of the product is at EUR 1300. The first gene sequence worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, has costed several hundred million euros. The study will start on 1 October, already at the end of 2020, all 9000 samples are analysed. First results are expected in the year thereafter.
Nigerian police liberate hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran School. According to instructions by residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the victims of the younger age, as the police speaker Yakubu Sabo announced. "The victims were abused. Some of them claimed to be raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the predecessor, being taught in the Koran and being "feessed". In fact, the protectors were held by their teachers under "the most decent and most inhuman" conditions, Sabo said. Some hundred students, including children aged nine years, were chained in a small space.
The Koran school was reported for about ten years. Inhabitants would have made attention to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents would have been shocked when they were taught about the conditions in the Koran School, Sabo said. They hadn't done anything about the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In most of the Muslim north of Nigeria there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often inadequate state facilities. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed bands. According to UN refugee aid, over 40,000 people fled over the border in the last ten months in the neighbouring state of Niger.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria’s police liberate 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in the north of Nigeria have liberated almost 400 students from disgusting conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that suggest torture," said the police speaker Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There the children were discovered on Thursday after an indication in an Islamicly marked school. The conditions there had been "human invaluable". The officials arrested the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held at their school as slaves and placed on chains. Some had been sexually abused. Television images showed abused and injured students in a apparently bad health condition.
World football choice: More claims to Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent
With a Gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and thereby record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he never voted in the world football game, further countries claimed to the Fifa. Egypt was not rated - with a curious reason.
Many things in the Fifa have proved to be incredible in recent years: the WM promises, dubiose plans of their President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt functionalists. However, the Fifa World Footballer elections have not yet been suspected of running uncleanly - if one considers that the voice-righteous national trainers and national crew captains of the membership associations often rather vote according to sympathy than to objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain had complained that he had not voted at all, further inconveniences now occur: Egypt complains that the voices of National Trainer Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they did not appear in the official and publicly visible voting review.
The Fifa apologizes that "the signatures on the electoral forms were in capital letters and were therefore not valid". The Egyptian association has been contacted several times to resolve the situation - without answer.
Sudan's trainer also amazed
There is also a cry from Sudan as to the choice. While the situation in the case of Egypt is traceable, the Sudanese association indicates that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic has not voted as it was finally assessed: with Lionel Messi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. However, according to Fifa, the vote had taken the same way, with the signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese bond.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had also raised claims: "Have not voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case he was suspected that the Nicaraguan football association simply voted in his name.
From the association now the message came on Friday: Voting, but of course was no intent. The filled election documents were "falsely" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguanic selection, said in a message of the Association. However, the second captain of Manuel Rosas has actually chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," said the Communication. Both Rosas as well as crew trainer Henry Duarte would have voted for Messi, "as it stands in the official list of the FIFA."
The other cases now allow the fifa to be examined in an investigation, but stresses that the election process has been externally supervised by the Consulting Company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains uncontroversial winner of the World Football Wal - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukraine Affair: Ranghohe Republicaner speaks for official investigation
Two rank-high Republicans have said openly for an official investigation against the U.S. president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican governor of the U.S. Federal State Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are found." He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the discoveries. These had shown that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to examine the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott said Trump Biden has been watching "for years".
So far, the Republicans have been criticizing Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, few have been unpleasant about this. Scott's comments are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned against Trump's policy several times, such as the enlightenment of environmental legislation and the reinforcement of immigration rules.
As another ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the congress is now to examine the matter and go to the ground for it."
Scott and Baker, as governor of U.S. federal states, have formally no participation in the procedure against Trump, which is decided on in the Congress. Hence, their comments are particularly symbolic. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed criticism about the situation. In the middle of Romney, representing the state of Utah in the second parliamentary chamber, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing".
The affair could be announced in the initiation of a proclamation procedure against tromps that the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an examination of this, and they are proposing him power abuse for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the drafting procedure. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could work on a so-called impeachment, but the decision on a actual mandate is many in the Senate, where Trumps Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. Until now, no US President was dismissed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers to board of Rackettes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they should have raped and killed in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had been arrested with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Lybish refugees on board unauthorized the port of Lampedusa. After severe protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was revoked by a Italian judge after a few days.
Now there are new serious punishments against racketes. Thus, three men who are tortured in libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspiciouss have been arrested in a reception camp in Messina, Sicilia, after migrants had recognised their pencils in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we have no secure information," said "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben New Builder of the German Press Agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspiciouss in the North African country had raped, tormented and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically shongged and exposed - by repeated and constant physical violence," then it was said in the communication.
NGOs and auxiliary organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without passports," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. It is therefore very likely that they are also acting on the ships. "It is therefore very important that it will be examined."
The Italian Judge Ex-Innen Minister Matteo Salvini called for an immediate excuse from Rackete against which aid to illegal immigration is still identified in Italy.
Musk pursues delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric automotive group a strong boost on the exchange with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100.000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an email published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks newsletter. The challenge is to bring the cars fast to the customer. To this end, Tesla has to offer as many resources as possible.
Investors liked that: Tesla's shares went with a plus of more than six percent from the trade. The course has no longer been awarded for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered some 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 30,000 to 400.000 cars. For this purpose, six-digit numbers are required in the current and next quarter year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the winnings margins low. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
U.S. coupon struggle: Redo only one bridge funding
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the Representative House on Thursday and decided a transitional funding until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August on an increase in expenditure limits for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States will once again be there before the new fisheries year beginning on 1 October. The Senate followed the representative house on Thursday and decided a transitional funding (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, it would have come to a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a partial closure of the Federal Administration. President Trump has to put the decision into force.
Shutdown cancelled
Preliminaryly, the Federal Administration is now financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year ending on Monday 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in due time on the 12 expenditure laws allocated to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Administration cannot benefit first of all from the expenditure framework extended for the new financial year from 1.3 Bio. to $ 1.4.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the expenditure laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chances in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. In turn, the Senate has also prepared ten of the twelve expenditure plans more or less, which are hardly more than a majorityable.
In the Senate, the spirits are distinguishing in the area of resource allocation for domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans obviously try to force $12 billion for the wall construction, one of the major priorities of President Trump. Democrats disturbed the wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute about the wall construction was escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the wall building, the spirits divorce
It is currently unclear how the parties want to get closer to this question. Probably more than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of the transitional funding beyond November 21 and a shutdown is not excluded at the same time.
In view of the persistent inability of the Congress to agree in time on the twelve expenditure laws, and the consequent risk of shutdown gains ideas to automate the process of popularity. S. 1877 for the avoidance of shutdowns, the financing of the Federal Administration would automatically continue at the previous level, interfere with Parliamentary travel activities and retain their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are presented.
France allows artificial fertilisation for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertility is also intended to be open in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority for a regulation of the government which allows all women to use an in-vitro fertility, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous seed donations.
The presentation still requires the consent of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in the future many "children without father" could grow up. Also the French Bishop Conference is against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which was defended by Minister for Health Agnès Buzyn as "Chance" for society. It represents the modern family in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her imagination, the cost of artificial fertility for all women is to be borne by social insurance.
Fertilisation with sperm of dead husband continues to be prohibited
On the other hand, with a small majority, the National Assembly rejected an amendment which should give widows access to the sperm of their dead husband. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial fertilization is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past where women forfeited the release of the sperm of a deceased. The opponents of the prosecution in Paris argued that such a given child would be a "specially difficult destiny".
On the other hand, many Members of the Government Party La République en Marche (the Republic in Move, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and opposition members had expressed themselves for the artificial fertility with the sperm of the dead partner. They stressed that a widow would be called on a "double grief" if by the death of her husband was still unfulfilled with their child's desire.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be consumed with the sperm of an unknown one in the future, but not with its own partner.
Until now, the artificial fertilization in France is only allowed heterosexual pairs that cannot testify to children. They must be married or live together at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that the parenthood remains prohibited.
In Germany, artificial fertilization is theoretical open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, however, it is often difficult.
Compensation payment for climate: calls after flight charge for UNIs become louder
The universities are often flying. That is why the country wants to have a air conditioning charge in future. The directors say they don't have money for it, but now they are also internally under pressure.
The universities should also be restricted when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschule
The debate on air-conditioning on flights from universities and universities before the summer break is again in swing. After the country-rector Conference had responded skeptically to a corresponding propulsion from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint explanation, doctors of six bath-württemberg Universitys and a pedagogical university for a compensation for service flights. This is the first step "indispensing", at the same time, there must be a wide debate on the avoidability of flights, says in their opinion. The original cabinet decision planned in July is on ice, because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the Greens.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the Secret Service FSB, the prisoners were supposed to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen from North Korea were already arrested. At that time there was a shot change between border guards and boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later killed his serious injuries. However, this time there were no injured, it was called.
The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages. North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way to Russian territorial waters. There the Russian coastal guard runs according to their own information on the protection of their marine biological resources.
30 000 ink fish captured
During the re-checks, 30 000 ink fish were detected and captured on the boats. In addition, the information was captured after three fishermen and two motorboats and brought to Naodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's fisheries authorities had also issued no fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, according to the complaints made by local entrepreneurs.
The head of the association of Russian fishermen in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, has recently complained about high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fish with narrowly synthetic networks banned in Russia. With these, small lives would also be taken out of the sea. In addition, the networks would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they need 200 years to be destroyed.
Recently only 18,000: US lower asylum upper limit
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with selected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country of the earth defends itself against protection seekers: As the Foreign Ministry in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal access of refugees is further reduced. Recently threatened believers and Iraq's asylum will be received.
The U.S. Government wants to reduce the historically low limit for the admission of new refugees. In the marketing year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, the maximum of 18,000 people will be left to the country, as the US Ministry of External Affairs explained. In the economic year that has been almost expired, the limit is still 30,000.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the admission of protection seekers from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, there were far higher limits on admission.
The planned upper limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. The Foreign Ministry nevertheless called the United States "the mercifulst and generousst nation in history", a formulation that strongly reminds of the language use of the U.S. president.
A "responsive dealing" with refugees aims to ensure that refugees can return to their home countries to help reconstruction there, explained Trump. For his hard course in migration policy, he gets a lot of support from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the border to Mexico that wants to lock tromps. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had attached to the national emergency. Whether there is a timely connection between the current action and the current internal policy developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj business and a possibly threatening posture procedure.
The U.S. Government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future, following the representation of the Foreign Office: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqers who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thereby in danger, as the Declaration of the Foreign Ministry shows; however, from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken up.
The United States wants to achieve that people from this "Northern Triangle" of Central America in other countries apply for asylum. In this context, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements to prevent immigration at the US southern border to Mexico.
Court of Justice ordered the release of Orang-Utan from the zoo
An Orang-Utan female has been transferred to an appointing station for human apes in the United States at the request of the Argentine justice from the former zoo of Buenos Aires. The "Sandra" born in the Rostocker Zoo in 1986 was awarded the rights of a "non-human person", therefore its release was compulsory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight, not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human ephfins are not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, they are to live in the future in the outdoor area of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other Orang-Utans and 31 Shimpans, among them "Bubbles", formerly pets of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before entering in Florida, "Sandra" has to endure an approximately 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US Federal State of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent a few years in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen after her birth in Rostock, before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" by animal protectionists in 2014 contributed to the transformation of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an apocalypse. By 2023, there is a research and education site for the conservation of the diversity of species.
Record for Swiss Extreme Mountains: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountain climb Dani Arnold is a new house-arrhythm ride at the nearly 3000 meters high tins in the Italian Alps.
Without network, double floor or other tools, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Tins in a new record time.
Arnold was dressed with Jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness freeness, needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise. Thus he banned the old best mark in nearly 19 minutes.
Arnold is now recordholder at Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European northern walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
No matter what the trade conflict with China, the US trade product manufacturer Nike has recorded a significant profit. The net profit increased to $1.4 billion in the end of the quarter (approximately €1.3 billion). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year period, as the group announced on Tuesday. This is mainly the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", which the Adidas competitor directs online to its customers.
The turnovers increased to $10,7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August. The most strongly added Nike sales figures with a plus of 22 percent in China. Thus, the group of Beaverton in the U.S. state of Oregon also benefited from its approach to directly address the consumer via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial Chief Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer with strategic investment and thus increase its competitive advantage. The investors reacted to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stage ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments on football professional Juan Jesus from AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has imposed a lifelong stage ban against a fan. The defense from Brazil Jesus had been confused by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and invited his club to take action. "@officialasroma you already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted late Thursday. He reported the fan's account at Instagram and the police. In addition, the Roma adherents could never visit a game of the club again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Rassism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly scanning Italian fans racism against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You have to identify and throw from the stages," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino in the weekend. At the beginning of the statement, racist singing at the first party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florenz last Sunday.
But also about the adherents of Juventus Turin, there had been last discussions. The Italian authorities have now declared 38 celebrating fans of record champion Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them are likely to no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed. For the rest, therefore, prohibitions from four to seven years.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra-Fangroups in the area of Juventus. The twelve are subjected to severe depression, money laundering and private violence. The club had brought the investigations into role with an advertisement last year.
The Ultra leaders should have seen Italian media reports behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "militarly controlled" ticket trade for the fan curve and should have pressed Juventus employees to get to more favourable cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennials are narcisstical, the generation Z is political - whole years are conceived with tangible names. If you look more precisely, the awards of contradictions are stuck. How well do these labels describe the respective sense of life for young people?
"The Crabs come!" On September 21, this call officially started the crab catching at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun, with which also the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival was launched, as the Department of Public Work of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee was known.
Gaochun, the southern runner of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions in ecological terms with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, the people in Gaochun have started crustaceans. Over the past few years, the crab industry has developed to be a prominent sector that provided for high income and became an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years Gaochun has actively developed a major, ecological and scientific development of crusticide as well as a technique-based crustaceans. And the city has worked for the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and for the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform on the distribution of power, optimization of administration and public service services and has built carefully the service network for "Accessions under a roof, a team for criminal persecution, a network for services, a platform for credit granting". This will enable the city to fully optimize the environment for authorisations, services and development.
Gaochun is fully engaged in the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a trailer to seal intelligent high-end production companies, biomedical and medical technologies, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and health sectors, as well as ecological farms leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all areas of tourism and of foreign tourism of national significance. The ecological and cultural resources of the landscape of Gaochun have been integrated to the future.
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of the sanctions - Trump contradicts
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani has spoken of a claimed offer from the United States to cancel penalties after his return from the UN Full Assembly. The United States would have, in return for discussions with the Teheran leadership, put an end to all sanctions, explained Ruhani on his official website.
However, President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian colleague on Twitter: "The Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had compelled that a meeting would take place. "And America says that I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The kind of criminal measures that should be terminated would have been held to debate. "And they clearly said that we will lift all sanctions."
However, Ruhani was not in an acceptable manner, criticized Ruhani. In view of the existing penalties and "the poisoned atmosphere of the maximum pressure" no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Kanzler Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear agreement with Iran negotiated with Russia and China. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, like Merkel at the edge of the UN General Assembly.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 descendants
After the western Turkey was shaken within the shortest time of two earthquakes, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were hurt during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the past, there have been nearly 200 descendants, the Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This makes anxiety about a catastrophe growing.
14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for safety reasons. Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. The earthquake of starch 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and panic in the millions of mettropoles. Now the government wanted to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, announced Octay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for bidding, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself the late danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year poorly built housing houses fall into - among other things, the many smaller earthquakes that shake Istanbul regularly.
City planners, such as the famous architect Mücella Yapici, have warned for years that large open areas, which were registered in the centre as refugees, have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük-Beben in August, the engineering chamber of Istanbul had warned that an estimated million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-safe.
The Thursday epicenter of the baby was located in the Marmara Sea in the District of Silivri and in about seven kilometres deep, as the Avad Disaster Protection Authority announced. A few minutes later, a small afterbirth provided even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbulian Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu told on Twitter that damage or damage had not been reported. The State Senator TRT showed people who run out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings in the district of Silivri for safety reasons. Some students cried as on pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquake. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the anatolic earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the quake near Istanbul in 1999. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that a earthquake could threaten the strength of 7.1 to 7.4. But when it comes to the earthquake is unclear. On Thursday the earthquake, the west of the country and Istanbul again met.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have so-called Go-Bags ready packed with all the necessary standing next doors, and schools teach children how they have to behave when the earth wakes. When the next big quake comes, be unclear.
The Turkish President Reep Tayip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people had been hurt. Some buildings had suffered light damage. The Istanbulian Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu pursued the developments of the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). According to it, two minorettes of Moshes crashed into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning about afterbidding in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users report panic. buildings waked. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It had been more intense than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Halfmond, Kerem Clinic, warned against afterbidding via Twitter. He called people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The date of the quake is officially indicated at 13.59 (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a rebike indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
It was only Tuesday that a earthquake of the starch had shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was to feel until Istanbul. Also its Epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the millions of metropoles, the disaster protection authority Afad already informed on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that took place on this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a heavy earthquake.
Researchers assume that earlier or later there could be a disastrous earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually eliminate - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects the earthquake to be a warning now. It would have become more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," says Ersoy to the transmitter. "From or later the greatquake will also come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an incident - the quake raised great concerns in Istanbul. In Albania, there had been only a few days ago a vicious earthquake - there were 68 injured. Also at the ground sea this year the earth had bowed.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine
Two brisant documents provide new ignitions in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible arrival procedure, the US Democrats are enhancing: The complaint submitted by an anonymous advisor about Trump and its controversial telephony with the Ukrainian President raises important points of detection against the President. Trump itself looks once more as a victim of a "hexenjagd". He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: United Airlines airport passengers locked in toilets - flights redirected
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilette, a flight was redirected by United Airlines. The WC door was blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the Airline reported US media.
During an extraordinary intermediate landing in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time) the woman could finally be released from the narrow cabin. Some an hour had she been locked in it, U.S. media wrote on other passengers. For further flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to switch the machine.
In a video spread on the Internet that is to come from the US media of flight 1554, is to see how several people try to liberate the woman. "We are currently working on opening the door, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man. The airline's excuse for all passengers. Open was first whether the woman receives a compensation.
The Cakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unrecognizable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation" the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book on the Brexit Chaos in Great Britain.
The novel "The Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27, the Diogenes publisher (Zürich) shared. This is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now at once the most powerful man of Great Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is willing to let no one stop.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If Parliament is closed, so that the government can not be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers are shamelessly lying as the Soviet leaders once once when Brexiteers in high positions are just calling for the catastrophe of a no-deal - then a writer has to wonder what he can do. There is only one answer to writing." Written by McEwan in the spring of the Roman, "machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas, published in 1915, is the first story of Gregor Samsa, who awakens one morning and sees himself "as an incredible disaster", is now and afterwards excluded from family and society and eventually ends. "Ian McEwan denies himself before Kafka to describe a world that stands the head," it was said by the Diogenes publisher.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria’s railway infrastructure
11.200 cars in Austria and Hungary receive fluid brakes to reduce the noise load by freight trains. In addition, sections of rail connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna's Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electricized.
This is intended to make travels more comfortable and to reduce CO2 emissions according to the EU's infrastructure peak 'Connecting Europe Facility'.
Thomas Cook: All travels cancelled until 31 October
The German travel organizer Thomas Cook cancelled all travels until 31 October 2019 one day after his insolvency request. Travels could "not be entered for insolvency reasons", the company informed on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travels, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Travels and Air Marin, which are already paid or paid completely. As for travels starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further approach is examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany was in the Sog of the Pleite of the British Mother Group and had made an insolvency request on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Bucher travels, is occupied in Germany about 2000 people.
Insurer wants to transfer hotels back to money immediately
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels in abroad who are still home to Thomas Cook holidays are expected to receive money from Zurich insurance. Payments to the hotels are, according to Zurich, linked to the condition that holidays are no longer required for extra payments.
Based on the booking information and without submission of separate invoices, the hotels in the vacation sites are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as said by a Zürich speaker of the German Press Agency. "This applies immediately and subject to the condition that Thomas Cook travelling from these hotels will not be invited or required for individual payment of hotel accounts," continued Speaker Bernd Engelien.
Insurance thus responded to reports by hotel guests who had been forced to pay their accommodation on their own site, so some had to put more than 1,000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had strongly criticised this.
As many hotels are affected, the insolvent traveller will vote on Friday with the insolvent traveller, said the insurance speaker. According to Thursday, 70 000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschalurlauber were travelling from Germany. The Zurich Germany has secured vacation and return of the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels through the Zürich Insurance only help the travellers who are still on their way. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on vacation, it looks bad. On the late Thursday evening, the company informed that all travels would be cancelled until 31 October. This was also valid for bookings already paid.
As it is about trips starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further approach is examined, it said. Basically, the insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels has stopped. dpa
The company refers to the Insurer Zürich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibility of reimbursing the travel price and apply their claims on a web form.
Prince Harry destroys explosive mine in Angola
Prins Harry has long continued the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he is now walking directly on the traces of his mother.
With a blue splitter guard West, the British prince Harry in Angola has burned and destroyed an explosive mine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico, he set the ignition circuit on Friday morning before running TV cameras. At a safe distance, the explosive body exploded in the Savannan landscape without damage. Although the only halo trust has destroyed more than 100.000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mining fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry then wanted to walk directly on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same bomb champion who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to set the way she went then. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spaced minefield in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a 10-day African trip that has started in the South African tourist metropole Cape Town since Monday.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The risk of non-dealing remains acute
Actually, Premier Boris Johnson had clearly decided: with him there will be no guarantee of a third suspension of Brexit negotiations. But what statements are in the polarizing British for ever. The recent judgment of the High Court of Great Britain will be like a damocular sword on the Blondschopf. His suspension of Parliament to be able to perform its Brexit-Course until the date of expiry was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament requires Johnson to lead to a prolongation of bilateral discussions by 31 October. However, Johnson had repeatedly excluded that.
Boris Johnson thinks the deal is still possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass over to Johnson. In the meantime, when visiting a hospital, he made indications that in the event of a disagreement until the end of October he supported a prolongation of the negotiations:
You know, we'll follow the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU to 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm careful optimistic that it works.
And the time runs gradually from Brexit dealers in Brussels. About six weeks later, the EU and the British submarketer have been able to imagine the time to prevent Britain's exit from the European Union without agreements. However, the recent discussions have not reached any breakthrough again. An agreement seems more difficult to imagine by the end of October. Breaking the British Prime Minister's law does not take effect again. The opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister. She fears that Johnson might put the Brexit in any way in the event of a non-deal.
US authorities: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, there have been 805 confirmed and likely injuries in this context, the U.S. Health Authority informed CDC. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there were already more than 900 people, about 500 of which confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lens damage is known. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the United States.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times, Mohammed Ali's videos were divided into online networks. The building entrepreneur and actress in Spain calls for a "volksrevolution". For the Friday he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military to which critics are proposing corruption and misecurity. Ali is hoping to have a million participants in central places of the country.
At least the security authorities are alarmed. At the center of Cairos, there was already an increased police presence. Several U-Bahn stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir site were locked. In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians on news and photos related to protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Last weekend there was protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There had been no such open protest in Egypt for years. According to the human rights watch organisation (HRW), the security forces have been arrested almost 2000 people since last week. Many of them have been arrested randomly - only because they were "at the wrong place", HRW informed on judicial advocates.
The organization also criticized the censur in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to interfere with further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after he had crashed the democratically elected Islamist president Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government hosts, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partly condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Greenland Expedition back
The Polar Researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland Expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in the port of Hamburg, among other things by the Skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought air-activist Greta Thunberg with the "Malizia" racing over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had examined and documented the consequences of global heating on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coast of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future Movement is a blessing, said the Polar Researcher. He has been waiting for years for the young generation to speak. For decades it has been known that the earth is warming up. Yet, many have acted like a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often happens under exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of the heating and devastating of the seas. In the expedition, among other things, it was measured with a drone greenish glassery and fished with networks after microplastics.
For his "fight for sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans" the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the Hamburg climate week. "For all of us who are at the heart of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award of prices. "He is a witness to the changes that have occurred in the Arctic during the last decades."
Terrible Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for nudles 430 Euros
430 Euros for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Englishburg in Rome: This seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The invoice of 80 Euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the subscription on Facebook, which resulted in hot reactions.
"Such cases harm Rome's view. We urge the police to examine whether this is a fraud," a spokesman of Federation, the association of travel leaders in Rome, according to the Roman newspaper Il Messaggero (Freitagsausgabe).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this is not to be removed from the account. Also a drink money of up to 20 percent of the invoice is normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could, after the turbulent disclosures of the last days, actually be faced with an official cancellation procedure, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the representative's house as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, the telephony is supposed to be with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The punishment of the Whistleblower, who has made the discussion of concern for national security and for the democracy of the United States with his complaint at last, is monstrous: The President has misused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the election 2020. He has depressed the dependency of Ukraine, and so he wants to force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be completed in the currently published signature of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not render the full words. The telephone on July 25 is only a episode of a much larger history, in which the centre beside Trump is mainly his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes its beginning from the public in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani reports travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the President Selenskyj, who has just chosen, and the lawyer himself knows that his intentions are soft. "We do not interfere in a choice, we integrate ourselves into an investigation for which we have the right," he says the newspaper. You could think it is inappropriate, but "this is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants us to pursue investigations in Ukraine for which there is hardly a basis - "because this information is very, very helpful for my clients and can make it helpful for my government."
The lawyer and former Mayor of New York seemed to have infected with right conspiracy fantasia, which is fixed on Trump's counter-candidate at the election in 2016: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at that time to construct a cause for Russian investigations in the US. However, this claim was never serious.
This is precisely the investigations that the Trump will speak so prominently on the phone with Selenskyj in July. The version Giulianis and President are: The former Vice-President and currently prominent candidates for the presidential candidates of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as the Ukrainian officer of the Obama Government, urged the release of the then Ukrainian General Prosecutor Schokin. In order to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible for which he worked his son Hunter Biden. Biden Senior has depressed the Ukraine financially to destroy the corrupt makeups of his family.
Actually, the end was something different. When Joe Biden asked the Ukrainian General Attorney to go, the investigations against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden had never been directly affected of it. Schokin was also deeply corrupted, the U.S. government was far not the only Western partner who urged its release. In addition, the Obama government also expressly supported the investigations against the company.
Disturbances at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances at Instagram and Facebook. Therefore, mainly Germany, Great Britain and Spain are affected. On the website all disturbances.de, users report that Facebook has not always been loading since about 15.30 p.m. Also Instagram declares the error message that content could not be loaded. Also Whatsapp seems to be affected by the disturbance, although not yet in the same extent.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disturbances
It's not the first massive fall this year. As in March and July, the services had been lost for several hours. And as in previous cases, users are taking back on Twitter this time, especially to make their trouble air.
Polish scientists in Antarctica saved
Three Polish scientists have been saved from the chilen air weapon from the ice of the Antarctica. They were on their way with a sludge boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They were lucky in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue helicopter for saving.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"We received the message at 9:30 a.m. just before ten we started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the snakeboat."
Poland has operated on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Attention: Smartphone does not charge cableless
Practical, but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since the last time several new smartphones have arrived on the market, which support cableless charges and sell themselves very well - all in front of the new iPhone 11 models, we want to call again a study from the beginning of July. The cableless loading of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the cableless loading of smartphones. This is, according to the knowledge of the University of Warwick, extremely harmful for the devices. Reason for this is the significantly larger heat development. If you load a mobile phone normally per cable, the battery is warmed up to 27 degrees within three hours. On cableless charging, the researchers have always measured more than 30 degrees even when the smartphone is perfectly aligned on the charging path. If the mobile phone is something next to the spoil, the temperature increases even more. In addition, the watt strength of the charging path increases, which leads to power consumption.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the sustainability of battery is a crucial factor. In that case, each degree is a factor. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery is not only in capacity, but also in total does not last for so long. So the lifetime is less. Therefore, the researchers recommend that the smartphone should always be charged per cable. Since a battery exchange is always connected with high costs in modern smartphones, it is likely to be a helpful tip. Apple has at last increased the cost of a battery exchange even again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technique is extremely comfortable: easy to place the device on a suitable charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without a disturbing cable salad and laborable fume. Since Qi (is for inductive energy transfer) is implemented a global standard, which exceptionally involves even Apple, there are hardly restrictions. However, the technology according to researchers should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Nepalese mountain climb has, according to its own information, entered 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world within only six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, informed his expedition organizer.
The former soldier wants to climb up every 14 eight thousand in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international strikes: from him comes a picture of mountain climbing in spring, which is on Mount Everest's serpent.
In May, 11 climbers died during the climbing in a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the climbing of the 14. Eight thousands: currently Chinese authorities lock the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, it is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal’s government wants to talk to China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals are also a fervent elephant cow, a police speaker informed on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protective area near the famous and visited by many tourists of the former rock mounting Sigiriya. The animals were likely to be between 15 and 25 years old to the police speaker. A autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year. The elephants are often farmers on which the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time, approximately 50 people are killed by elephants each year. This usually happens when the animals move near their habitat villages.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. Theoretically, their killing is the death penalty.
Constant British oil tanks leave Iran
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" leaves the Harbour City of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it has been established by Iran. This was announced by the Bandar Abbas Navy, according to the IRNA News Agency. The Iranian Revolution Garden had set the tanks under British flag on 19 July under the preliminary ruling to have disregarded the rules of the maritime law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the House wants to examine the Pleite of the traveller Thomas Cook in a comprehensive way. It is intended to cover the salary packages of the board as well as the question of why the British Government could not contribute financially to the survival of the company. "Our interest applies to the supervision in the company as well as to the control by external accounting officers," informed the committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "Our obviously we have to do with a bad example of management grievance."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of genes in the familiar increased risk of intestinal cancer has seemed to have been overestimated so far. As a result, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a current study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are likely to weigh more difficult than they have been adopted. This has consequences for calculating the individual darm cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk causes Tesla action to rise
This was written to Tesla employees in an e-mail published on Thursday (local time) by the "Electrek" industry blog. The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it was continued in Musks newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the customer quickly. Tesla must offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went with a plus of more than six percent from the trade. The course has no longer been awarded for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a total of 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers are required in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the most favourable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the winnings margins low. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
Will British Government deal with Brexit law? Johnson retained
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is seeking to reject the last law adopted by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit, as he said on Friday only to journalists that his government will comply with the applicable law.
The law provides that the government should apply for a suspension of the expiry date should not have been reached an agreement with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capital law", which is difficult to negotiate with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the suspicion on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political shakans" in order to cope with the law. Johnson could use a procedural string that shifts the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said he strives to pursue a Treaty with the European Union, "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is to reach an agreement."
Iran evidently runs up uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European Contracting Partners in the dispute on the rescue of the historical nuclear agreement. "The European States show incapacity or lack of willingness to act on concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference at the edge of the UN Full Assembly in New York. In the event that they do not agree with their promises, he set out "more steps" from the agreements of the hardly negotiated agreement of 2015.
Background is the conflict with the international agreement on the prevention of an Iranian nuclear bomb, which contained the commitment to Teheran, to normalise economic relations. The United States went out of the agreement in 2018 alone to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to a change of course in the nahost policy considered aggressive. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with harder duties and, in the meanwhile, reverse severe sanctions against Teheran. Iran responded to the last rehears of the uranium enrichment restricted in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium or at least prepared for use. According to IAEA details, Iran is also preparing for the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuges.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of pressure on US sanctions, condemned Rohani, but there will still be further discussions that hopefully had a solution.
Rohani continues to argue Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, the mixing situation changed: Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed on Monday of the U.S. estimate that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran in Jemen had known to attack, which was regarded as false confession by the United States. "We have nothing to do with it," said Rohani on Wednesday.
"The ones who raise such charges have to present evidence for this," said Rohani. However, that would not have been known to the European leaders in the conversations with him during the UN General debate. Instead, they would only have called for the rebels in Jemen to be unable to attack such as this. Rohani had in the past days met with Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible discussions with U.S. President Trump, the major sanctions of the US administration had to be suspended, Rohani asked the government in Washington to turn to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet of other star crossed sun system
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the depths of the world space. This was first done before. The comet allows conclusions on other sun systems.
What was only one suspect at first is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crossed by our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized after his discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has raised the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-reached comet was discovered on August 30 by the amateur astronomen Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory on the Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centuries diameter. Follow-ups of various observations confirmed not only that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017 only the second interstellar object that has been seen during a flight of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get insight into a foreign solar system nearby before he disappears on Nimmerrevision. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canarians. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150.000 kilometres per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that surround the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia of the US Space Authority Nasa in a communication.
According to the analyses, the comet is on the road on a so-called hyperbel path that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of heavenly bodies. To honor his discoverer, the interstellar sulphur stars, which had been first guided under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, were named 2I/Borisov, whereas the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object that has been detected in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: In contrast to 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in an approach. Thus, researchers remain many months for investigation. "The object will reach the largest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes until October 2020."
Several observatories have already visited the visitor. Thus a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterisation of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first study, set the diameter of the sky object to 2 to 16 kilometres. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear sweep of the comet.
Researchers of the Canarian astrophysical Institute (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar sweep star, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of our solar system's cometes, which indicates that their composition must be similar," IAC researcher Julia de León reported. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, supplemented de León's colleague Javier Licandro.
The discovery of equal two interstellar visitors within only two years, according to the IAU, suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such visits are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors may capture a planned satellite mission from the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the Agency wants to station the three-part space zone "Comet Interceptor" (German, for example, comet-off hunting hunters) at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres away from the earth. It is intended to run on either an unrated, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
At the time before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic it is so far: On the new Mega-Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines is landed, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers will be completed annually at the new airport, and in 2025 it will be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's recent Prestige project is also called "Sestern" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four start- and land courses that are to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-new U-Train transports passengers in just 20 minutes to the city centre of Beijing.
During the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been largely smaller since 2006, has been repeatedly postponed. On the other hand, a first passenger machine has been landed in Beijing after four years.
New airplane is intended to fly in 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours - of which, the British Space Agency (UK Space Agency) dreams. It is possible to make it a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) that the company develops Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire for the 2030s, the U.S. Sender CNN quoted the Agency. "This is the technology that could definitely be done," said Officer Graham Turnock to the transmitter. "We talk about the 2030s for the ignition, and the work has already been very advanced."
To promote the project, the British Space Agency wants to cooperate with the Australian in closer cooperation. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis is currently about 20 hours. As the only oversound plane for passenger transport, the Concord had covered the New York Paris route from 1976 until its operation in 2003 and spent three to three and a half hours for it. In 2000, a accident occurred when a Concorde was launched at the Paris airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 inhabitants were killed. Last year, the US-American Aircraft Engineer Lockheed Martin Planne announced that it had been able to develop an overshore plane together with the U.S. Rome Authority Nasa, the "X-Plane".
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed-point-to-point transport," says Reaction Engines, among other things on his homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. In addition, such aircraft can be put on outside the earth'smosphere and thus enable the "nicest generation of truly reusable frame equipment".
Breakout in Washington: Trump wants to discover anonymous tips in Ukraine shops
In the Ukraine business for possible abuse of power of the U.S. president, Donald Trump wants to find possible inappropriate places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday before employees of the U.S. missionaries at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned was almost "a spion" and with those being treated in the past "a little different" than today.
This was considered to be an intimidation attempt against addicts. The event was actually not public. Several US media, however, spread audio media from the talk on Friday. Democrats reacted to the statement of the President.
The Democrats in the U.S. Representative House had announced on Tuesday preparations for an official cancellation procedure against Trump. Their claims were mainly based on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service employee who raises serious accusations against Trump and its government centre. On great public pressure, the notifier’s descriptions were made public on Thursday.
In the framework of his work, the Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government employees, which the U.S. President uses "the power of his office" to achieve that another country is mixed into the US election 2020 for its benefit.
In the centre of the punishments, a controversial telephoneate between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which the Trump encouraged his official colleagues to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It concerns former businesses by Bidens son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his speaker from the Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race around the democratic presidency candidate for election 2020.
The Whistleblower also accused the White House with regard to the Ukrainian telephony: Leading government employees would have tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been prepared. This was, after the discussion on the direction of lawyers from the White House, but was removed from a database normally intended for it and was stored in a particularly protected system. To date, only a gross conversation protocol was published.
The identity of the advisor is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it was an employee of the CIA Secret Service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the President wrote, among other things, that the "so-called Whistleblower" has distributed information from the second hand that would have proved inappropriate. Therefore, there may be no hints or spiones.
As Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have played information to the Whistleblower, but caused anxiety. The Chairman of the U.S. Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted worried and complained, Trump's statement once more undergoes the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, various committees have been exploring against Trump and its environment for months. In view of Ukraine's petitions, the Democrats are now propulsing research with new voucher to initiate a possible clearance procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a schedule for our investigation," said the chief of the Secret Service Committee in the representative house, Adam ship. Trump attacked ship sharply, cast him a wrong representation of the matter and again called for the resignation of the Chairman of the Committee. Trump frequently confused ship and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government employees from the security and external policy area, who were active in the majority of democratic and also in the Republican presidents, were in a declaration published on Friday behind the investigation of a possible official cancellation procedure initiated by the Democrats. If the claims were true, then it would be "a skrupelless abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
For the further process there is no precise schedule. With their majority in the representatives' house, the Democrats could try to make a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on a actual mandate is many in the Senate, where Trumps Republicans have the majority. Therefore, the prospects for success of such a procedure are low. Until now, no US President has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Counsellor: jobs are "sleeping"
The plans of the brand VW to further reduce the costs in production could be at the burden of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is about the autobuilder's business council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from 10 billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros, of which 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
A key to this is the staff costs. The "coming pact" negotiated between companies and the company's council in 2016 is already intended to reduce 14.000 jobs alone in Germany. In principle, a job can only be degraded by the autobuilder if it is proved that the activities associated with it are no longer necessary. In addition, employment insurance is applicable until 2029.
However, as our newspaper now learned from business councils, jobs in production, which are not actually the subject of disposition, are "sleeping" over another way - that is to say by the official course, so free regular positions would often not be resumed.
In these cases, the Board of Directors does not have the possibility to force the restoration. In the meantime, there is a lack of employee in many places that increases the concerns about the gradual excavation of vehicle works would be greater. In order to increase the fear that the vehicle production could be deducted from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW only said: "A adaptation of the employment volume is done as agreed socially comparable along the demographic curve."
The VW brand wants to standardize production more globally and control new projects centrally. This also aims to reduce costs and to accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production board Andreas Tostmann said at a management conference in Berlin: "We are advised to make ourselves crises in uncertain times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the United States and China."
This way it has already been successful: For example, this year, the production costs per vehicle have been reduced for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Before journalists Tostmann said that the production time for Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures for production duration do not call VW, according to our newspaper information, it is round at Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the Structural Work of Wolfsburg is the only VW factory in which vehicles are manufactured. The works of Braunschweig and Salzgitter finished components. For Wolfsburg's interior VW is the rule that there must be built 800.000 cars annually in order to be profitable. In 2018, however, the discharge in Wolfsburg was only about 700.000 vehicles - contingent on the falling diesel demand and the problems of changing to the new consumption and exhaust tests WLTP.
However, as Tostmann has announced last year, in Wolfsburg, a million cars should "perspectively" roll from the band. This is intended to enable the association of the golf production in the stemwork - because the work of Zwickau is re-equipment to the location of the e-auto production.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Gulf and Tiguan have recently declined. Therefore, the expectations are now to rest on Gulf 8.
Forced with Voodoo to prostitution: human dealers condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been occupied with swords, swallowed into the rubbing area and forced to be prostitution. Six contempt human dealers have to go to prison for this.
Six contempt human dealers from Nigeria were sentenced to punishment and imprisonment in Bochum on Friday for up to eight years and three months. The accused women from Nigeria had swallowed and forced to prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the travelling Nigerian women had still to put a ritual swear in the home before a Voodoo Prister.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought over the Mediterranean by libyan sludge boats. However, the dream of a better future did not come. In Germany, they were distributed on different board cells to finish the claimed sludge costs of average 25 000 euros. The wages were therefore completely deducted.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and the subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on board cell in the process. "The work made women physically and psychically difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the pronunciation. "Some were right responded."
The judgments are based on commercial and bonding inclusion of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, penalty and severe compulsory prostitution.
UFO calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm Sustainable Stress with the Airhansa Group has again threatened the Ufo Confederation with Streiks.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "notify on 14 October about the work fighting measures in the LH Group", Daniel Flohr informed on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have refused to conduct the UFO tariff negotiations for months. It also concerns whether the trade union has legally cancelled tariff contracts at the Lufthansa Airhansa.
At this point, Ufo now looks strengthened after a decision of the Employment Court of Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to make it clear that the tariff contracts were not cancelled. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the procedure. "The second court considers the matter completely different, I think unlikely," said the Ufo Board of Director Flor.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Bundesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt in order to review the status of the UFO as a trade union. The company argues that the trade union has not set up a representative board for months and is therefore not able to complete its role as a tariff partner.
In the past, a strong leadership in the Spartengewerkschaft, in whose course many members of the Board and the Advisory Board have resigned, including the long-term trade union leader Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had exposed an already started vote on the barbecue of the cabin staff at the end of July, because of the doubts of their leadership.
Enlightened entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
So far, Saudi Arabia was not just known as an international tourist magnet, but this is to change now. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new Visa provisions.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract international tourists in the future. By 2030 the number of international and domestic visitors would be increased to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission informed.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the Chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is so far difficult to access to tourists. Visums are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with family members in the desert state. With the new rules, the arch conservative Kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. According to its own opinion, Riad wants to reduce its dependency on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery of the country in Abkaik and the oil field Churais. In the follower the national oil production drastically broke into the height of the oil price shoes. It may take several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom reaches its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are sitting in preparations for wedding
Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) were preparing for her wedding. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in her Instagram Stories several party photos on which she was seen in the white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a young family celebration in Los Angeles according to the People's Magazine.

The beebers gave the Ja-Wort in a New York standby a year ago. A larger festival had not been held at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you do not want to compromise, you can't lead a relationship."
Two dead at aircraft crash in Czech Republic
Two people died when a small plane crashed in the west of Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area at the city of Mecin (Metschin), the police shared. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
Since Thursday night, the authorities had searched for the machine after the crew had issued a emergency signal via GPS. The search was also in use by a military helicopter. The cause of the accident has to be determined. The crash location is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are threatened by extinction
Besides harmful people, the World Nature Protection Union, IUCN, reported on Friday in Brussels, the world Natural Protection Union has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of these are not found on any other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 already stands at the highest level of danger and thus pre-extinence.
The IUCN divides threatened species into six categories: "potentially endangered" via "hazarded", "hazarded", "trusted from extinction" and "extinct" to "extinent" and "extinent in nature". Totally, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide than threatened.
Eberic and Wild Rosskastanie threatened
In Germany, Eperschen (Sorbus) is threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are either small or by transforming or weakening their living spaces."
It also looks bad for the wild usual Roscastania. They have been considered "hazarded" since 2017, stage two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan miner flock next to a sulphur. It has spread from Southeastern Europe across the whole continent since the 1980s and has hardly natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild rosesstania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account in this assessment, the trees in cities, parks and alone.
Smoking species and moose also in danger
The IUCN scientists at the same time created new European red lists for molluscs, belts and moses. More than one fifth of the weighing animals and mooses and almost half of all smoking species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This lies mainly in the destruction of the wilderness, inclined species, agricultural practices and climate change. Weaving animals like snakes played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the ground and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office. "We have to limit the human impacts on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 Injured
In recent earthquakes in Turkey, 34 people have been injured. Dead were not found, according to the information. Thousands of people had to leave their houses, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said the Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. Since the past, there have been almost 200 descendants. The earthquake of the starch 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and paniced in the millions of mettropoles.
Now, the government wanted to use a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, announced Octay. Over the past 20 years Turkey has not been prepared enough for babysitters, said Istanbul's Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquake. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatolian disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate.
One of the most difficult earthquakes was one of the strengths 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The Epicenter was then located in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. More than 17 000 people died.
Already on Tuesday, a quake of the strength of 4.6 had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called the inhabitants to stay damaged buildings away.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the semi-time show
The Latin-Pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the half-time show of the next American football finals Super Bowl. This gave the singers announced at Twitter. "It will not be bigger," wrote Shakira to a photo of itself and Lopez. She's incredibly excited to stand on the Super-Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020 it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that since 1996 she had dreamed of getting on Super Bowl - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying to heaven at the half-time show. "Now it is more special because the NFL exists 100 years and I will perform with another Latina." They could hardly expect "to show what we can do girls on the largest stage of the world."
Shakira pointed out in an explanation that she feels honorable to stand on one of the largest stages worldwide and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it is the first time that the two "konings" are together on a stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York and her parents came from Puerto Rico.
Fight against decreasing spectator counts
The Super Bowl is the peak of the American football season. The game and the semi-time show belongs to the most viewed TV transfers in the United States. Even if you have last dropped the numbers of viewers: In February, the spectacular in the United States attracted the least tourists for more than ten years. However, there were still almost a hundred million people in the average.
About the half-time show of the previous Super Bowl, there had been upset in the front field: In the dispute about dealing with Quartalback Colin Kaepernick, in February last, the media reports suggested that Topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, the pop group of Maroon 5 led the semi-time show – the critics were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then the Quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, was on the knee in the gametime of 2016/17 before NFL games at the Nationalhymne, who was protesting against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, many players took over the gesture. This provided great excitement, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked the most afro-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been ununited since March 2017 and has no NFL party anymore argued. He pretends the Uniteds to not want to rent him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are likely to be expensive to the pleasure of the traveller Thomas Cook, according to a press report. High depreciations on outstanding loans and loans are threatened. This also affects the credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in their release of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisses would have to make total depreciations of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (approximately 2 billion euros) on their books, according to the report. That would have shown estimates of the Alix Partners consulting company.
The creditors of borrowing would have to buy depreciations from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors from 550 to 825 million pounds. The amounts actually depreciated are likely to lie at the upper end of the bandwidth, an expert said to the magazine.
The amount of losses of creditors at the end will be shown after the insolvency procedure ended. A person close to this procedure did not spray too much hope. For example, the about 40 planes of Thomas Cook in Great Britain are "old" and many of the real estates are in bad layers. Most money could be obtained with the sale of the airport slots as well as the brand Thomas Cook, it continued.
Rakete is supposed to have brought disgusting murders to Italy
The Sea-Watch Captain Carola Racket may have brought men to Italy who should have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any secure information about it," said the speaker of the Refugee Organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the News Agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognised the three men in Italy. They are conceived to have raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The contested actors were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New buildings stressed that refugee organisations could not check who they had let on their ships. "They come without pass".
On 29 June, Carola Racket had brought illegal migrants into the port of Lampedusa and hit a ship of Italian financial police. On the day, the three suspects should have arrived there, and the captains are investigating for aid to illegal immigration.
U.S. Federal Government Warn against Huawei
The Head of the US Internet Authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network exhibitor Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high," said Pai to the "Shopsblatt" in view of the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which obliges each company to "under Chinese law" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The applicable law also prohibits the company from informing third parties about such requests," continues the FCC Commission. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to request a "confidentiality declaration" by suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, such as technical solutions, reports the "handle sheet" on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of the hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of software code that change with time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine," that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check each individual update in real time to detect safety risks," the FCC CEO continues.
The Chinese Group Huawei has made close contacts with the Chinese State Device:
The ownership conditions are opaque. The employee company, who is supposed to belonging to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai to the "Tradesblatt".
The United States has found findings that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for conversations in Berlin to advertise for the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in North France burnt: Schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A gigantic firewall lights the sky over a northern French chemistry factory. The fire is deleted after hours - the cleaning work could take days.
After a fire in a chemistry factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's cribs remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not open precautionately on Friday, the competent prefecture informed. The Ministry of the Interior had invited the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not suspend the smoke. Injured were not. Farmers and breeders were invited to bring their animals inside, protect their feed and set the harvest first.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. It is still the risk that after the deletion of the smell, the prefecture was spread on Twitter. According to the prefecture, at the fireplace 240 firemen were in use, as well as 90 policemen and gendarms.
From the chemistry factory, a gigantic black smoke pillar had risen. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the Lubrizol company's factory, making the additive for oils. The production facility is a few kilometres from the city centre.
The factory in Normandie belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations that are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso at Milan, a devastating chemical accident occurred in 1976.
The prefect of the region of Normandie, Pierre-André Durand, said to the transmitter BFMTV that no "high toxicity" was found in samples at first. However, the contamination of the nearby Sys could not be excluded. In the river dusts were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early morning at 02.40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause first remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located on its side between Paris and the port town of Le Havre.
French Minister for Finance: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, called Germany for larger investments to boost economic growth in the Eurozone.
Germany has to invest, now, the earlier the better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening in the idea of the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the Eurozone is weak, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation is worse in order to make the necessary decisions."
Acting would have to be done to those countries that have budget play rooms for more investments, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France does not have these gaming rooms, added the minister and referred to the high state debt of his country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French debt must be "stabilised" and "sensitive", said Le Maire.
In the past few years, France has repeatedly appealed to Germany to make more public investments to live up to the European economy. In turn, German politicians have repeatedly urged France to overcome its budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides for tax simplifications of more than nine billion euros for households.
This means that the French government responds, among other things, to the protests of the yellow-west movement. The new debt is expected to fall to 2.2 per cent, as expected 3.1 per cent this year.
Does he still try to tricks?: Johnson awakens question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes the "capital law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could use another slurryhole. On this occasion, however, the Tory politician is deviating.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is obliged to implement an unregulated Brexit, despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which is to prevent this. On a question that is the case, Johnson said to journalists that his government will comply with the applicable law.
The law provides that the government should apply for a suspension of the expiry date should not have been reached an agreement with the EU until mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capital law", which is difficult to negotiate with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed on Thursday the suspect that Johnson could try to use "political shakans" in order to cope with the law. The Prime Minister could use a trial that moves the law into force to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he is pursuing a contract with the European Union. "We are sure to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Johnson's Chief Consultant Dominic Cummings declared, however, that he felt the political controversies about the Brexit as a "travel in the park" and proved confident that the desired EU exit is still coming: "We enjoy what we will win, we will be (Note: Red: from the EU) no concern," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the "Brexit Leave" campaign during the election campaign before the EU referendum in 2016, now acts as a head of the British government seat Downing Street. He is supposed to sit behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister into a fairly clear situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they were all standing before the camera of Linda McCartney, which has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Tasks) is deeply in the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married with her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was apparently proud and touched when he presented the video band "The Polaroid Diaries" in the middle of September in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among the illustrated guests were Ringo Starr, Stellla McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Fronts-France Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiarys is a volatile look into the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for the property of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always there. Thousands of polaroids have made it, some hundred of them are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
It is portraits, quiet lives, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the artist Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one of the key points: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him.
There he dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in the bathmantle with a bag on her head or wears unformed Moon boats. Surely, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the light light on her farm in southern England or Scotland also had a very normal life. Thus, Mary McCartney said BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that had cast her father from old potato boxes. And it hasn't always been cleaned up at the McCartneys.
Like hardly another medium, the Poloraid camera will start in the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the choice Click: You have to recognize when a great picture happens before you. And then you have to cut it in exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different picture." And Linda would have had the gift to always catch exactly the right moment. "She just knew that she had it," said Paul in Eshun-Essay.
There the light, the composition, the image section and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertainable picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes have already acted as abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the just new beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared just 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed against Iran, Turkey wants to continue to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel oil and gas imports from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN Full Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems with importing Iran's oil, as some companies had withdrawn "for the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "in particular in this question and in many other issues continue our relations with Iran," said the Turkish President who repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since the end of the International Atomic Agreement with Iran, the United States has been pursuing a policy of the "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic. According to the United States, Iran has undergone a nuclear programme in secret and does not comply with the agreement.
Their penalties have led to the invasion of Iran's oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran, and in recent months the voltages in the Gulf region have increased significantly.
U.S. Government wants to restrict refugee reception
The U.S. Government wants to drastically restrict the admission of refugees. The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained on Thursday, the annual upper limit of a resettlement programme was to be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees at present. This corresponds to a cut of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that although the United States would continue to see the support of refugees, the most important task is to protect US citizens and serve them. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. Government wants to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqers who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as the Declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows; however, from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be taken up.
The 1980 program is to elect refugees from UN camps around the world and resettle in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the financial year 2020 would be the lowest in the history of the program. The current limit of 30,000 is a deep value. When the predecessor of the U.S. President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House left, the number was nearly 85,000.
Assistance organisations reacted to the announced reduction of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the Head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. U.S. would thus continue to harm their leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to restrict immigration into the United States - legally and illegally - strictly. The U.S. Government is expecting, according to its own information, 350.000 asylum applications for the next financial year. These figures are separated from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Come near a peak"
U.S. President Donald Trump has advocates in the Whistleblower shop of the spionage. Anyone whoever sent to the informant who claimed to abuse of power to him, "come near a top," said Trump according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York. This reports consistently with several US media.
Thus, Trump spoke to the employees of the U.S. mission. When he was asked for the person who informed the Whistlelower about controversial transactions in the White House, he answered: "It's coming near a top." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spion and betrayal we used to deal with it a little differently than we do now."
Observers appreciated the last remark on a possible reaction to the death penalty. The Democrats exercised sharp criticism of Trump's statements and threw him intimidation of witnesses. In addition, it was an attempt to impede a congress examination of a possible decision-making procedure against him, the chairmen of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory in the House of Representatives.
The Whistleblower instructs the President in a complaint now published to have abused his office to interfere with another country in the US election 2020. Concrete is among other things about his controversial telephony with his Ukrainian colleague Wolodymyr Selenskyj in summer: In the conversation, Trump put him close to initiating investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump contradicts any misbehavior.
It is still unclear who are both the Whistleblower himself and its informants. However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower is supposed to be analyzed by the CIA Secret Service.
Refugee boat censured: Babies and young children drink in Egea
People are repeatedly trying to get over the Egeic Sea from Turkey to Greece. Regularly, the often too small boats are known. During the fall of a sludge boat, seven migrants have now died - including five children.
Before the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed when a snake boat was killed. Among the death victims, one baby and four other children, the Greek coastal guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were thus able to be saved from the floods from the occupation of a passing ferry.
Among the victims, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants were broken out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of Chios Island. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish Festival.
The countries from which the migrants come are not known yet. At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Egea, mostly in much too small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Help (UNHCR) 174 people died on this route.
The Who Break Out Concert
A U.S. concert of the Rockband The Who found a joe end because of an impassion of Leadsänger Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. At the eighth song, Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should let it as long as it is still running."
Lead-Gitarrist Pete Townsend asked for apology and supplemented that Daltrey could "now really not speak". Townsend promised to come to his expense at a reconcert. However, a date is not fixed.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who declined. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year band colleague Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed itself 55 years ago.
Suddenly adjusted rental: WeWork lets real estate markets ride
In New York, WeWork has risen as the largest office rental.
Within few years WeWork rises from the small start to driving power to the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in the crisis. Renters must fear billions of revenue.
The crisis of the Office Renter WeWork threatens to disturb the balance on the largest real estate markets in the world. The company had disposed of founder Adam Neumann a few days ago, postponed the planned exchange course and started with the sale of subsidiaries and values such as the private jet for the leaders to win financial gaming space for the next weeks and months. In addition, the British "Financial Times" reports, among other things, that the end of new rentals with immediate effect has stopped. This is, among other things, in New York and London, the largest leaser of office spaces suddenly from the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces long-term and rents them short-term in partially small units of members. This can be individual free professionals, small startups or whole departments of large companies. To date, WeWork burns money in this business at breathtaking speed. Last year the company lost $1.6 billion, in turn of $1.8 billion. This year alone, the rental costs should have increased by the rental of new large areas to estimated $2.5 billion. To limit the loss, the new company management is now supposed to have pulled the emergency brakes and stopped the rental of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times" WeWork has now concluded lease contracts with a duration of up to 15 years, which result in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for the whole real estate markets.
According to the calculations of the economy Dan Alpert from the Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork hired in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months nearly 300.000 square metres of office area. In the last 24 months, WeWorks New contracts alone made sure that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly marketed areas. Without the WeWorks expansion, the office performance in the US-Metropole would have increased at that time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". Similarly, it looks like in London, where WeWork has now maintained several dozens of office stations in its best position.
Also, in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be discernable without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork’s main renter, in a last year, by the spare fund provider of Deka, the office house purchased for nearly 100 million euros in the centre of the Financial Metropole.
Many hires have rebuilt their real estate for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make his business model profitable soon, the real estate owners should well describe part of the expected billions of revenue. Access to the - without further buttons - reserves of WeWork they have not despite the long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of the individual sites of WeWork is usually carried out by additionally founded subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only bound to close limits.
Russia again arrested many North Korean fishermen
The Russian coastal guard has again taken place against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, there have been a total of 262 other wild fishermen who had been illegally fished in the waters, according to the Russian Home Service FSB of the Interfax Agency, reported on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Previously, the border guards had been shot and three of them had been injured. This time there were no injuries, it was called. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore traveling in Russian territorial waters. There, according to their own information on the protection of their marine biological resources, Russia's coastal guards were explored by 300,000 ink fish. In addition, the information was captured after three fishermen and two motorboats and brought to Naodka and Pojet at Vladivostok. According to the re-controls, Ria Nowosti, the coastal guards in 2018 established more than 8,000 infringements.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had also issued no fishing licences to the North Koreans, according to the complaints made by local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there in 2019.
The chief of the association of Russian fishermen in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, has recently complained about high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fish with narrowly synthetic networks banned in Russia. With these were also small lives from the sea. In addition, the networks would simply dispose of in the sea where they need 200 years to be destroyed. Also, the ships themselves do not describe the hygienic and technical rules.
The arrests in the previous week reported that Moscow had been injured three members of the Russian coastal guardian. According to the FSB, a wound Northern Korean died later on his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first set a North Korean boat and then a second after it had opened the fire.
United States prohibits entry against Ex-President Castro
The United States has obliged the former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children to prohibit their entry. The American Foreign Ministry justified that in a Thursday communication with Castros' participation in "great violations of human rights". As the head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean, he is responsible for a system where thousands of Cubans were randomly arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As Chairman of the Army, the brother of the dead Revolutionary Leader Fidel Castro was also involved in human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disrespect of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the persistent crisis on Cuba and in Venezuela," twin American foreign minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had made a ban on entry, among other things, against members of the Venetian government and the military. For months in Venezuela, a bitter force struggle between the government and the opposition has been killed. The United States has imposed a number of sanctions against Maduros government to force him into the knees and to help the opposition leader and self-represented Interim President Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allies of Maduros. The socialist Caribbean island will receive oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of dispatched doctors. According to the United States and the Venice Opposition, Cuba has also sent a number of secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government in the oppression of government counterparts.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests hitherto want to go back to the street but thousands of people for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the movement of Fridays for Future plans again actions and advertisements in thousands of countries worldwide. The beginning is expected to make New Zealand and Australia due to the time shift, before the protests over Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major customership in Canadian Montreal. Also before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather.
How much the global appeal will be on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week, is relatively unclear. Thunberg itself was good things. "Last Friday more than four million people struggled for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. So far, in the context of the stress week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she supplemented.
Especially in Germany, the course last Friday was very large. A good third of all world demonstrators - about 1.4 million - were involved in protests in 575 German cities. This time a listing of the movement is planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropols such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as youths in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
At the age of then 15 Thunberg had set himself before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to encourage the politicians of their country to make more use of climate protection. This has resulted in the Fridays-for-Future movement. Climate protests are mainly involved in pupils and students, but in increasing terms scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for more ambition from politics in the fight against the heating of the earth and the threatening climate disaster. In particular, under the Paris climate agreement, global heating must be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial time.
Thunberg had arrived nearly a month after a two-week transatlantic session with a high sea racing hunting in New York, where she had last participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she held an emotional speech with the UN, in which she spoke intricately to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home Stockholm, her use for more climate protection of the alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation was awarded on Wednesday.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
People in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in future. This is a change in fire protection. "This is also true for smoking," said a speaker of the Emergency Ministry on Thursday in Moscow of the Tass Agency. The prohibition is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, therefore, has to expect a punishment of 3,000 rubels (EUR 42,46). If the cigarette should make a fire, then the punishment is higher. Under the prohibition, according to the Ministry, equally burning candles. Even meat shots on the balcony are no longer allowed.
Slag against Cybercriminelle - Explorers lift servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators for the first time lifted a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
Overall, 13 actors are suspected of having hosted numerous websites on the Mosel, as the operator of a arithmetic centre in a former NATO bank in Traben-Trarbach, through the international criminals.
This informed the General Staatsanwaltschaft in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday evening at a large action. The Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Customers of suspects should have been among other things the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", who had destroyed investigators in spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million Telekom Router at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in Cyberbunker, according to the General State Attorney.
One such host was first lifted in Germany, it was called. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the access action with support of special units such as the GSG9, there were searches in Germany and abroad nearby. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. In the afternoon, the investigators wanted to inform more details.
New World Climate Protests of Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests hitherto want to go back today But thousands of people for more climate protection on the streets.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the movement of Fridays for Future planned to re-establish actions and advertisements in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropols such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Yüchen in Nordrhein-Westfalen or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major customership in Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests - Who are Thunberg's backmen?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm up the climate. Amazingly more that a 16-year-old girl will keep the powermen in front of the nose of this time. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for herself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in motion and brings young people to raise themselves for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man can win a collection of children and youths for himself. In 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt excursion to engage in a fairer world. At that time he has also been able to win a group of young people for himself and overwhelmed the sea to get into the promised country, similar to Greta Thunberg recently made himself on the journey to America with a sailboat.
But there is a shade page in this regard? Why does it need a share named "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. Besides, her mother has published a book that has largely sold, thanks to the daughter in the Rampenlight. Also old-proved followers of Greta Thunberg were a little sad about the last PR show, or the journey with the boat was probably too much to be put on thick. This is also not unjustified, because the action came to pass in the media worldwide very well and it flows a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
Here are the spirits now divorced: Is it morally right to enrich the world's salvation? Is it even authentic when certain people's circles work together with stock exchange makers during the world's rescue action? Whatever the position is finally involved, a critical and reflected point of view is ever more important in a democraticly marked society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense also seemingly good projects of certain trend sets critical to question.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crossed by our sun system
A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system.
The astronomers' suspicions have confirmed themselves: A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its type.
Garching/Washington - The researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainness: A comet by another star is currently crossing our solar system. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and is currently busy with astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomy on the Krim
The known body was discovered by an amateur astronomy named Gennadi Borissow on the Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and further post-observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is indeed an unknown comet that is not from our solar system. He is only the second of his type that was seen during the flight.
The great chance for astronomers is now to shake insight into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to our own system, as the astrophysical Institute of the Canaries reports. The comet is clearly interstellar origin, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbel path that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before approach - and can be observed several months
But before it is so far, the astronomers can see him closely. For, in contrast to his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that he can be investigated from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the largest brightness and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia by the US Space Authority Nasa. "Then it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First knowledge of comet 2I/Borisov raises hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to 2 to 16 kilometres of diameter. At the same time, the heavenly body seems to be similar to our cometes - for as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the sulphur star is similar to us. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, supplemented de Leóns colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. That two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids occupy the researchers again and again. Only recently a giant asteroid ran through the earth and got dangerously close to her.
"Absolutely disgusting": Rachel Johnson disgusting over brother
About Boris Johnson it becomes lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister gigs with clear words the warling language of the Prime Minister as "smakklos". It is not the brother she knows.
"Cpitulation", "Betrug", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to rust up - at least verbally. At the time of questioning in the underhouse this Wednesday, this was a massive irritation of the opposition, and in the meantime other critics have reported about: Twenty bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author said to the Sender Sky News that her brother should use words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of a EU exit should be "hanged, longed, quarterly and celebrated". She thinks this is very rejective. They do not recognise the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had joined the EU parliament elections for the "Change UK" anti-Brexit party.
In particular, she found that her brother Jo Cox mentioned a EU-friendly sub-house member who had been murdered by a Neonazi in 2016 a few days before the exit referendum. Their thoughts could best be honored by moving through the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the subhouse. "It is very smackless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first', now criticized Johnson's sister. The acter was evidently coming from the right extreme camp that is "through this kind of language". For all those who grieved about them, it was very flavourous.
Also, the widow of Cox criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jos name is used like this," he twittered. The best way to honor them is when you passionately and determined to enter into what you believe - no matter what you think. But you can never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had arisen in which attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had set up his office as State Secretary and his mandate as a Tory member. "I had been broken between loyalty to the family and national interest in the past months - it is an unresolvable tension," explained Jo Johnson the step.
Johnson's language also put on sharp criticism in the church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "this country is not worthy". In a common statement they said: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside of Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear at the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: In the contemporary show of the coming Super Bowl, two women appear with Latino roots. The promises "a explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the coming final of the US football-Liga NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino Community in addition to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the United States," shakira shared in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates its 100th birthday in Miami on February 2th. In the metropolis at the southern top of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a puerto-rican origin.
"I love the Super Bowl to put two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents were emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" great hits and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as a actress and is seen in the "Hustlers" drama in the German cinema from November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. Her worldwide breakthrough she created in 2001 with her first two-language album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of half-time guests is expected in the United States every time with tension. This year many are also considered the selection as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sport event and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectrum. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones provided for furrors there. Usually, there are more than 100 million TV viewers in the NFL.
Last year there was political controversies in front. The argument about the quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who, by protest against police force against blacks, had refused to raise itself in the play of the National Hymne and had been severely addressed by the US President Donald Trump. From solidarity with Kaepernick some musicians had rejected a super-bowl appearance - including Rihanna and Pink. The fact that the Rock Group of Maroon 5 was finally criticized by many.
An actress and Youtuber adds Egypt’s ruler: First, Mohamed Ali remains abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether the streets of Egypt again flow blood have spent the last week both abroad. One of them swept back at the airport of Cairo on Friday. President Abdelfatah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The Ex-General, who in 2013 released the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely selected Head of State, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisis' action against political Islam and no silver for human rights infringements at the Nile - in one week where Egypt's security forces were arrested hundreds of people because they had refused to protest against the presidents. He had "no reason to worry," Sisi at the airport in the microphones of State television. "The Egyptians are not able to lead into the Irish."
The President of the other man, who is currently trying to get into the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad where he disappears the access of the security forces that would arrest him immediately when he tried to enter the Egyptian ground. The 45-year-old actress was known only a minority of the Egyptians. Today he is the toneous voice that dominates the political discourse in the Cafes, the living rooms and the teastubes of the country: With his youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets" Ali calls up his country's people to raise himself against Sisi.
He goes to the Head of State directly and in quite rustic language. While the people are hungry, swallowing the President in the luxury and let themselves build beautiful new palaces, it is said. The army leadership on which Sisi is based on his rule, casts out corruption and enrichment. Because he made business with precisely these gentlemen for 15 years, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the just to explode click numbers show.
After the first time last week since Sisis handled by power, thousands had demonstrated against his rule and almost 2000 citizens, among them prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, had been arrested, Ali called for a "million march" for this Friday. The fact that so many people would really wake on the streets was unlikely. But there were several small protests, for example in Giseh at Cairo and in China at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests whose participants were prominent to corruption and demanded its departure. In these protests, the police also put on train gas and rubber fires. These videos were not able to verify independently. From security circles it was said that the police had finished the protest.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrators last week Banner with the president's portrait in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the destruction roads. In Cairo several subway stations were closed in the Inner City because of maintenance work, most roads around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the Revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaaa space, where the 2013 trailer of the crashed Muslim Brother Mursi, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should be prevented from gathering dissatiscents: Sisis Futurespartei wanted to hold a large customer here for the President.
Mohamed Ali led these measures to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us collide with police officers." But as a retractor, this is not to understand: "All Egypt is the Tahrirplatz."
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection seems to be much slower than purchased by the provider, there are various test possibilities.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need to blindly trust the speed specifications of the providers. Customers can check how much of it is actually achieved in case of notice.
Finally, the pre-proposed transfer rates are a component of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre of Bayern.
If the connection seems to be much slower than the provider, there are various test possibilities. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"The tests of the providers are carried out, however, according to the specific requirements of the supplier and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively," the Consumer Centre of Bayern recognises on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a suitable time period of normally 14 days to produce the promised performance. This is best to be done by letter in writing.
If this does not work after multiple calls, customers can cancel and may also require compensation for damage. However, if the success remains, only help the appeal.
First ranking Republican for investigation
As the first rank-hoger Republican, Vermont Governor has spoken for an impeachment investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it comes from here, is determined by the facts that are found," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower business before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the elimination of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised that Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to examine interventions from the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Trump observes Biden "for years".
Republicans have hitherto rejected with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have proved unpleasant about this. Scott's comments are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already acted several times against Trump's policy, such as the enlightenment of environmental legislation and the deterioration of immigration rules.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: Next Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" university. It was quite unclear how the films should continue with Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man will receive another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) according to "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This report matches several US media. Thus, the film start should be established in the United States: the film will start from 16 July 2021.
In the "Screenrant" magazine, Marvel Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spideys' way is being continued in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel Study are very pleased that we can continue to work on it ... He is the only superheld with the ability to play in different Universes, since Sony continues working on his Spidey verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Probably Sony Marvel should have presented an offer. According to industry magazines, the Disney Group, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of coming spin-man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
So Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" Finals
After nine stakes, the series "Suits" in the United States has now reached the big final. In the last sequence there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo appearances. And also the royal couple prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who participated in the series for many years, were told in charming ways. Respect, the following sections contain spoilers to the series final.
One way in advance: Duchess Meghan did not return in the finale for a last goodbye as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, a few backsights showed again the most imaginable scenes with the present Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and lucky wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his deceased prison sentence.
But even her true husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the "Suits" Finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) just climbs towards Altar to marry his engaged Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a prominent remark regarding his attraction. Whether he has actually overturned a gorge, the deceased Harvey wants to know the bridegroom only to say, "Louis, you're not the Prince of England".
Egg: Babies and four more kids drinking at boat sulphur
During a refugee boat in the Egeais, one baby and four more children are drunk. Overall, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coastal guard told on Friday. The nationalities are still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish continent. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Egea. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Help (UNHCR) 174 people lived. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the competent Commissioner of the European Union, he wanted to "informe Turkey about the situation of refugees," said Seehofer on Friday. Afterwards he wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help deal with it.
On Friday, a spokesman of the EU Commission confirmed the planned journey of Seehofer with the EU Ice Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Minister for Interior Christophe Castaner.
In Greece there are still unusual migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, said the Greek Civil Protection Ministry on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The rising figures were the last question of the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016, which provides for the EU to return all refugees and migrants who are illegally coming across Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take up an Syrian refugee from Turkey for any abolished Syrian people.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult on the Greek side because of the lack of staff. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos are suffering, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, nearly 29 400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: in a camp with capacity for 650 people are currently 5200 migrates.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, it had been so many, reported the state round radio.
Climate change: Heating leads to more heart attacks
According to medicines, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate changes are "health-safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology.

Especially people with heart-crisis diseases, older people and diabetes are affected.
Green politician must be responsible for punishment of photopanne
The Chairman of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the electoral struggle - was manipulated for this reason the cup?
The Canadian Green Chefin holds a multiway cup in the hand on a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has been quite unnoticed - and eventually noted. The reusable coffee cup with metal throat has never been held in hand by Elizabeth May, the Chief of the Canadian Greens. On the site of the party she was seen on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also been distributed to the media - and the cup was still a cutter (Pap) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chefin must be responsible for photopanne
The National Post then cast May a manipulation and that the party produces Fake News to appear more credible in the topic of "economy protection" and that in the middle of a election to the underhouse election, in which it also has the Trudeau increasingly difficult because of a mutation scandal.
The photo went into the social media viral and started the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a counter-translate of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their entrance bechers."
May showed itself shocked and devoted to her blog to not know anything about this action. To underline this, she posted the original: you, in conversation with citizens, a cup in the hand. However, the one, she put right, be from Bambus. She always did it. A speaker of the party said it was only about to put the party logo in the picture, and not to blown something. From the photo it is only one cut out on the website.
May writes, it's her suffering for the employee who did this. "I don't want to mention him as stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said to the Guardian and at the same time asked something of her overcome team: "If she wants to do a picture again, they couldn't do anything with my face, so I look younger?"
The German greens are also caught for their use of one-way plastics or for flights in Shitstorms - but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, at the holiday ice with plastic apple, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
It seems that Jaqueline Ng was secured a upgrade by Cathay Pacific by e-mail, but when she asked to check in, she was not allowed to board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get upgrading for the Business Class - of which many passengers dream. Sometimes they have luck, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how to not do it: An influenza declared an influenzaman has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Instagram follows Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On 30 May, she flew back from Taiwan to New York and on 7 June.
On the departure, the employees refused to upgrade Jaqueline, although they showed an email in which their Cathay Pacific claimed to have been upgrading. The letter wants to have received the influencer from a marketing employee of the Airline. The Airline, however, accuses Jaqueline to have misleaded the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-term flight. This time the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The staff at the JFK airport were skeptical: they were hooking up at the central. And in fact, the employee from which the mail was supposed to have dismissed the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The airline employees at the airport cancelled Jaquelines ticket and had a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1400 (circa 1.280 Euro) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the fluencerin turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests. Because Cathay had refunded the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: Cathay has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. The operating conditions of the Airline also say that it does not have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with that - and now turns a lawyer on.
Oil prices according to the report on arms restraint in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. Lastly, a barber (159 litres) of the North Sea Variety of Brent 61.83 US dollars - approximately 1.4 percent less than in the past. The price for a barley of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
An explorer for the course was a report from the Wall Street Journal on a weapons restraint in Yemen. Saudi Arabia was supposed to have approved a weapons restoration in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had led to five percent of the global oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels in the country of civil war Yemen had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the U.S. government, is responsible for Iran. A stop would eliminate the political tension in the region.
If there is a real agreement, you can focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, head of the compartment of raw material strategy at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices thus continue its downward movement of the last days. A barel WTI oil had been costed up to almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Lastly, Bloomberg was called on insider and reported that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack at mid-September was faster than expected. Thus, the production volume has reached a volume of eight million barbers per day and moves back towards the original quantity.
Lastly, there were several press releases called on insiders, reports from rapid progress made by the State Oil Group Saudi Aramco in repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to plan a exchange line and avoid negative striking lines.
At the same time, some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and the western countries revealed: the British oil tank "Stena Impero" is more than two months after it was fixed through Iran and the recent release on the way to leave the port. The crew is now preparing the departure while the ship continues before anchor, Reedereichef Erik Hånell shared the Swedish broadcast on Friday morning in a SMS.
However, the United States announced to move defence rakets and soldiers to the Iranian arch enemy to Saudi Arabia. The fear of a escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had significantly increased oil prices in the past weeks.
Prosecutions against Trump are sharpening
In the affair of possible power abuse by U.S. President Donald Trump, confusion prosecutions against the White House have become loud. Several leaders of the government would have strived to prevent access to the wording of the conversation at the end of July after a disputed call between the Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky. This explained an anonymous advisor. The speaker of the Representative House, the Democratin Nancy Pelosi, was prominent to the White House "Destruction". Trump spoke of a "Hexenjagd".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has argued that in the nuclear dispute there will soon be a third summit of powerholder Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and the prospects of success of such a meeting are questioned because of lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the Agency KCNA.
The United States has not yet done anything for implementing the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the Consultant of the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticised strengthened US sanctions and the joint military manoeuvre of the United States and South Korea. However, he hopes on a "wise" and "courageous" decision trumps to bring it back to close.
On Monday, Trump had said that he wanted to know what to bring a third summit with Kim before he was ready to explain. The negotiations on a defence of the North Korean Atomic and Rakete Programme have come to the floor since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, both of them met in the demilitarised zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to relive the discussions, yet without great success.

In view of the goal of getting Angola to free from mine until 2025, he later asked for running TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but they have not helped to make an obligation to help."
Pounds under pressure - interest reduction expected
British Pounds under pressure
Given a rapid reduction in interest, the pound loses value to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on a short rate reduction of the Bank of England (BoE) adds the pound of Sterling. The UK currency approved by up to 0.4 percent to $1.2269 on Friday.
Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades said that the sales triggers were statements of the note banker Michael Saunders. This statement was surprising, even if a chaotic brexit could be disappeared, as the insurance would affect the British economy at a disappearable time.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens on the economy through the Brexit Hickhack, without signaling a direct interest reduction. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will necessarily lead his country without a divorce agreement from the EU on 31 October.
More: With its provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay for him, says trade sheet editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: More Russian Manipulations Experienced
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, a former director of the World Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity of the Light Athletics Association.
New details of the Doping Scandal in Russia are presented to the entrance of the light-athletics WM - and they destroy the few of the credibility that the Russian sports had won at the beginning of the year and also only approachively. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Labor finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now found out that they were fake.
In December 2014, systematic fraud was revealed in Russian sports. The Wada had locked the Russian antidoping agency (Rusada) for three years. During that time Russian athletes had not been banned entirely from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee read after an individual examination in the summer games in 2016 in Rio about 270 athletes of the country under neutral flag, at the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. Also, in the world cubes in the various sports, they were allowed to take place in Russia even the FusssballWM with the host.
Missing positive findings
In September, the Wada resumed the Rusada band, but called for access to the laboratory and the samples. The data should provide information on the extent of the distortion of doping cases during state baptism. They should help to punish athletes and athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Light Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping Data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory was manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter General Zeitung" of Friday. "We have found numerous differences between the data that the Wada received from a Whistleblower and those received by the Russians in January." Many positive findings that were mentioned in the McLaren report were missing.
The WM is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Light Athletics Association holds the only organization on the Bann of Russia. At the WM in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already put into the room and asked Russia to reply to the claims within three weeks. Russia now threatens the relocking of Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion of the Olympic Games in 2020 in Tokyo.
