Tom wondered what Mary said was true.
We never agree.
It's uncertain whether the letter ever came or not.
We haven't done anything.
You lost your pen.
You're gonna lie in bed all day, aren't you?

What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not mad.
There's no doubt who's being elected.
He was hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read the Sagan about the ring-trilogin?

Put the tail on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need anything?
I want a few gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He would have done it already.
Room service, please.
Who did you talk to?
The boy took the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of myggy beds.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cold.
Does this remind you of someone?
I'd like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He'll fall for the temptation.
The TV doesn't work.
I can explain that.
She's acting like a kid.
How does it look?
Mary thinks she has superpowers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After stopping, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but at least you can accept that there are people who have other opinions than you?
Tom dropped the book down.
I'm the best.
English are hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't imagine meeting him again.
Even during working hours, I leave in salary for my internet dependency.
I never thought it would be so difficult to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone long.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't take myself down to the city.
At least it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it down?
Tom blinked with the whole light.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone says they did.
No one here is called that.
It's time to go.
All three men smiled.
Come sit down.
It's got to work.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.

That was very good.
Come and talk to me.

Why do you like that?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver turned the steering wheel to the right.
I'm on the wind.

How was the show?
Actually, it's pretty common.
It's made of skin.
