She's not a good cook.
Tom said he's not in any hurry.
I know that Tom doesn't know anyone who does that
I didn't know you weren't Canadians.
Come to watch us play music sometime.
Tom said he understands why Mary doesn't want to do that.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do that today.
Tom told me he'd complain about that.
Tom's a member of my house co-op.
Tom drove down the street Mary lives on, hoping to see her.
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know as well as I do that there's no chance that Tom will do that.
Tom wasn't sure if he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I know that Tom might need to do that by himself.
Tom doesn't seem to do what he's supposed to do.
It would have been tired to do that.
Tom must have told us the truth.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
We'll have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week.
Tom knew he would be punished.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone do that before.
That's not difficult.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.
Tom told me I should learn how to play the drums.
We have not yet succeeded.
I've never been to Paris.
Tom said he had eaten nothing, but that wasn't true.
I'm an atheist.
Tom said Mary was at home in bed with a cold.

Tom told me he thought Mary was puzzled.
Tom said he'd be happy to do that for you.
Tom said I looked a little pale.
Tom told Mary she should stop pretending to be confused.
Tom thought Mary was alone.
I know Tom's hiding something from me.
Did you know that Tom didn't start playing the guitar until he was thirty years old?
I wonder if Tom knows that Mary wants to do that.
I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think Tom know where Mary went on October 20th.
I know that Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why are everyone staring at us?
I know that Tom didn't know who had done that to Mary.
I reason Tom did that because everyone else in his family did.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary didn't know how to play the obue.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank you.
I would have left early if I could.
I know I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you'd enjoy doing that.
Tom hasn't talked to Mary about that yet.
I don't think Tom's nice.
Tom was the only one who was sleeping.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
I should never have let you go home alone last night.
I think I'm going to have the chance to do that the day after tomorrow.
Tom said you were really good at tennis.
Tom told me he thought Mary was autistic.
Tom would have wanted to go to Boston with you.

Tom said I don't have to do that this afternoon.
Tom said it was a good time to leave.
I know Tom's scared.
You can't appreciate the poem until you've read it many times.
I deliberately did that.
Tom should never have left early.
She's already married.
This is blasphemy!
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't awake.
Tom said he's happy he was able to do that.
You can't buy one of those for less than thirty dollars.
Do you think Tom would like to go to Australia with us?
Tom said he likes to dance with Mary.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary couldn't do that.
Tom must have seen us do that.
I doubt that Tom will run for President.
Tom should have done this yesterday.
Tom may be angry.
Tom said Mary won't be mad.
I knew that Tom wanted us to do that for him.
Tom said he didn't live in Australia anymore.

I hope I haven't forgotten anyone.

I suspect Tom and Mary are bored.
Tom has already been told about the problem.
I know Tom was disobedient.
I don't know anyone who hates Tom.

It's not for beginners.

Tom has a lot of friends here.
Tom knows he cheated.
I think Tom used to be a member of our club.
Where's your notebook?
I don't think I'll be as early as tomorrow as I was today.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
How many miles is it from here to the railway station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often adopts the behaviors and speech patterns that characterize the advantaged.
Tom said you were his friend.
I'm thinking of having dinner at six.
Tom told Mary he'd do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's through.
Tom said Mary's dog bite him.
Tom said he was doing that.
Tom said he's appealing to his suspension.
He's deeply attached to her.
I thought you'd show me how to do that.
I'm telling you we have to assume that Tom's dead.
Mary's got a hairdresser's appointment.
Tom said Mary thought she might be allowed to do that today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like someone's been smoking a cigarette in here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I think that question is not appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a kid?
I don't think anyone noticed what we were doing.
What are we going to do?
I could've cried.
There's no free lunch.
I thought you said we weren't going to Boston with Tom.
Tom's quit smoking.
I think I know what Tom's doing here.

Did you give Tom the key?
Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him she had to do that.
My father is a doctor.
I don't think I would like to be married to Tom.

I thought Tom would buy that car.
Tom and Mary said they're very busy right now.
Tom said he was planning to stay at home all day.
Tom should have apologized Mary.

I know Tom doesn't know Mary needs to do that.
Everyone here except Tom and Mary have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was satisfied.
Tom said he was going to help us do that.
Tom's house is very close to my house.
The host cut the turkey for the guests.
I know that Tom doesn't know he really doesn't have to do that.
I think Tom will be able to understand that.
I haven't decided yet.
I know that's not worth doing.
Tom told me he thought Mary had been rude.
It's not wrong.

What are you trying to do?
We didn't know if Tom and Mary were busy or not.

Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father.
I know Tom's missing.
I would've liked to do that.
It won't be so hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do that by himself.
I was so excited!
Tom is a party animal.
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party.
Tom will probably need to do that today.
I hope I don't have to do that.
Tom must have changed a lot.
No one's better at this than me.

Tom said he'd be thirteen next month.
I wish I was with you!
Get your paws off of me.
I'm afraid I have to refuse.
I know you retired recently.
I knew Tom would be happy if you did.
I wonder if we'll really do that today.
Tom's sleeping.
You're a good boy.
I should've just walked right in.
I don't think you've listened to me.
We are brother and sister.
I don't think Tom's done that.
I don't think we've done anything illegal.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before.
Don't you have a TV?
Don't give up!
I don't play the mandolin as well as you.

It's not very likely to rain tomorrow.
I didn't know you weren't planning to do that next winter.
I don't know what this means.
I think it is more important to discuss possible solutions.
I didn't realize both Tom and Mary should do that.

There's someone waiting for you.
They said they were ready.

I just want you to consider the possibility that you're wrong.
I'm sure I didn't say that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
I'm as happy as can be.
If they knew what was about to happen, they would have changed their plans.
I know Tom didn't know he didn't want to do that.
Tom's rich, but he's not as rich as Mary.
Go wake up Tom and tell him that breakfast is ready.

Tom's not home right now.

I didn't think Tom was annoyed.
Tom said he wasn't aware that Mary had done that.
Tom said he's faster doing that than Mary is.
Tom and Mary told me they felt hot.
I didn't know that Tom was supposed to do that by himself.
We split the plague three ways.
I don't think Tom could do that by himself.
Tom told me I was pretty.
What time does the show start?
Tom knows he needs to help Mary tomorrow.
Tom will probably not go jogging with Mary.
I don't think Tom know who did that to Mary.
All three of my brothers are older than me.
Tom said he didn't know if he could.
I know that Tom wasn't able to do that.
Keep left at the next traffic lights.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom loves Mary.
Tom doesn't need Mary's help.
Tom and Mary say they're lonely.
Were you afraid the first time you were on a plane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
I'm disappointed in my son.
I don't think I did very well.
Do you think there's a chance you'll do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There's a big supermarket.
I suspected Tom was discouraged.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure no one can see us?
There is no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom may not have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Has he been in touch with you?
Tom and Mary said they'd do that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today's the 20th of October.
Tom and Mary said they were planning on going.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary is not Canadian.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have kids.
I know that Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I think that book is not so interesting.
I was told that that's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team will continue to get better.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom definitely knows that he shouldn't do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think you should turn yourself in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known that I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom worked together.
Nobody will know I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed to get more exercise.
Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
I knew Tom was the one to tell Mary she shouldn't do that.
Tom said he knew I might need to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know Mary's in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom's concerned.
I wish I had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom was going to be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
Tom said Mary thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom said he probably wouldn't win.
It's possible that Tom doesn't know I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows everything.
Tom said it's not going to end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
The students did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they didn't care about doing that.
You will stay here until you are called.
My daughter is being trained to the toilet.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling fine.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something happened to him.
Nobody suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they've never met you.
I think Tom is a pretty good painter.
I know that Tom is a picky eater and rarely trys anything new.
Tom says he didn't do anything illegal.
I suspect Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know that Tom knows I know how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still chatting away.
You're a narrow.
Everyone was late except me.
He could not resist the temptation.
Tom will probably get angry if you do that.
I assumed Tom would agree to do that.
I'm a libertar.
May I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom will have to do that alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing is not as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted he'd been rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should talk about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know that Tom is a little older than Mary is.
Tom didn't know anyone had been hired to kill him.
Tom told me he can't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would like to do that.
Tom said he thought I might not have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know Tom's a bullet.
He's a smartest boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm pretty sure that wasn't what Tom meant.
It's not hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired to him.
I doubt that Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning on going anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he had never planned to live in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
I know Tom's about the same height as you are.
There's no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said he's glad Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she would read the book he would borrow her.
I woke up at 7 a.m.
I could have done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't yet told anyone they're getting married.
They said they were planning on going Monday.
It's not gonna be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't talk so fast, please.
They told me they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone they had to do that.
I think Tom paid too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worn out.
Tom told me he thought Mary was busy.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should've stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me he thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could've kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary is not awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to irritate me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone scared?
Tom thinks he can do anything he's thinking about.
We married seven years ago.
I could've done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could have done that any better.
I know Tom didn't do that right.
She's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary is better in French than she really is.
Tonight I'm free.
Do you think Tom would have done that?
That's his house.
I'm at home.
You don't need to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should have tried harder.
I thought Tom was going to do that today.
They promised they would check it.
I'm sure Tom would have agreed.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said he knew he might have to do that by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters.
Tom must have put up a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance that Tom might get hurt.
Tom said he was glad you'd done that.
I always knew that Tom was a troublemaker.
Well, I never!
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to win.
I'm a student, but he's not.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary was planning to do.
I wonder if Tom's really homesick.
Tom and Mary said they can't sing very well.
Tom said he thought Mary was good in French.
Tom says he'll always love Mary.
I wish I could speak French as fluent as you do.
I wish I was someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just wanted you to know I support you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in grave danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom think?
I just boiled a egg for myself.
Do you have a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary will probably not be able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said they like this time of year.
Tom wants Mary to know she can trust him.
They say they declined that deal.
I know Tom didn't know you couldn't do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
I know Tom's a very close friend of Mary's.
I know Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom wouldn't do that?
I know that Tom would unlikely agree to do that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom know what time it is.
It's obvious that Tom can't do that without any help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans to do that.
Tom could have asked me first.
You're not actually suggesting that I go out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should.
I don't think Tom's boss.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom's ever asked Mary why she didn't.
I would have done that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary he thought John was not hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that.
Tom and Mary swore that they would never hit me again.
Tom said he should have stayed in Australia longer.
Tom said he knew they might not allow him to do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should have left before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I need to do that.
I plan to stay at home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom's amused by what's going on?
We have not yet started fighting.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom's the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they're supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me they were ambitious.
Tom said he thought what Mary did was a mistake.
I hope no one comes.
I thought everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said he thought Mary was in her bedroom study.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Tom told me it didn't matter.
I know Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I'm twelve.
I'd forgotten about that.
Tom told everyone he was through doing that.
They figured there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were happy.
I thought you said you were happy you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little.
I know that Tom is much higher than I am.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that that's going to happen.
I knew Tom wasn't very busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom's faster doing that than Mary.
Tom said he thought that Mary might not be required to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everybody's having a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use anyone else's tooth brush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
Tom thought it was difficult.
We've walked all around the lake.
I don't think it's gonna be difficult to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom is as rich as most people think he is.
You won't do such a thing.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been thirty years old today if he hadn't passed away last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know that Tom knows I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom's safe.
I know Tom didn't know he shouldn't do that here.
Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like doing that.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
You're as high as my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom's already done enough.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that he was the one who stole Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told they had to do that.
We better tell the others.
Why is everybody talking about Tom?
Federer is lucky to promise at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them to.
I know that Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him angry.
When will he be done?
You're a very naked boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pillows with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning to do that.
Tom said he was wondering whether Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have e-mail.
If something sounds too good to be true, then it is probably.
Tom said he hopes you won't want to do that.
Tom said he wish he hadn't been there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in any hurry.
We may need to be in Australia for several weeks.
I hadn't planned to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom know anyone who can do that.
Tom said he expected Mary to participate.
I'm swimming every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They pretended they didn't know me.
I know that Tom is a bit shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you will succeed.
You know Tom and I'm not going to do that, aren't you?
Tom and Mary told me they finished doing that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have turned back there.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought that maybe you wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he had forgotten something.
She doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his plate at the moment.
I knew Tom knew who needed to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put down their books.
I know that Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
That's not possible with current technology.
They said they are trying to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom has already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he's not allowed to do that.
I suppose you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
You have a sense of humour.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook an omelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk anymore.
I wonder if we could do anything to help.
Tom said he'd be willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom can do that.
Tom didn't know he had to do that by himself.
Tom's dating a girl who's three years younger than he is.
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I know that Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think Tom will like this wine.
I think we talked on the phone.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a certain amount of truth in what he's saying.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom's a slope.
He's not a virtuoso.
I suspect Tom lied to me.
Tom will eventually need to do that.
Tom told me he would call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't told Mary what he has to do yet.
I know that Tom is a good diverg.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should have stayed home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed all of us.
He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he plans to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends are not here.
A wolf cannot be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he should have done.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't get paid.
Are you worried that that might happen?
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary did that.
Don't forget to take your paraply when you leave here.
I'll make sure that's done.
I'm wearing a suit, but wear no tie.
I'm as tired as you are.
Tom thought he might come down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized right away.
You're lucky you didn't get hurt.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
Are you sure Tom will do that?
We can't live without air.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary has always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows something we don't.
Tom said he was worried about Mary.
We all got in the car.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that or not.
Last night I pucked.
Tom's not very good at bowling.
Tom said Mary gave him something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wants to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be mad.
I don't think you've been paying attention.
We'll need more time.
I don't think Tom know what Mary's doing.
Tom said Mary's going to do that tomorrow.
You are both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe that Tom is actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We're all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that soon.
Have I ever told you guys about the first time I met Tom?
I began studying French when I was thirteen years old.
Tom said he wish he hadn't played chess with Mary.
I know that Tom will probably give you permission to do that.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said Mary knew John may not have to do that by himself.
I wonder if Tom's motivated.
Tom said he would have done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like it if Mary did.
I still wish you would do that.
Mary told me she wasn't planning to stay very long.
I didn't know you were going to be jealous.
Tom didn't know Mary had children.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom may be lonely.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't very busy.
I'm absolutely sure that's not going to happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was happy you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary is planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that.
You're very angry.
I have already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom wouldn't be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You've done your homework, haven't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not.
I got lost in the forest.
I know Tom's a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me he'll be in Boston next Monday.
Keep your mouth shut!
Tom said he knew he might need to do that on Monday.
Tom said he regreted what had happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary he had to do that.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
Do you have a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents won't allow me to do that.
I don't think Tom know how much time it will take for him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried his father's clothes.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary why he did that.
Tom said he's been trying to do that all week.
You have really beautiful teeth! Are they real?
No one knew that Tom was the person who contributed most of the money.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was frustrated.
Tom and I were both a little confused.
I'm sure Tom knew that would happen.
Tom told me he thought he could do that.
I admitted I did what Tom said I shouldn't do.
Did you know that Tom and Mary have three children?
It's not just a smaller problem.
I'm not satisfied with your explanation.
I know that Tom's done that already.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should have done that.
There must be a reason Tom isn't here.
It's not appropriate to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me he thought Mary could run faster than he could.
Tom said Mary's scared.
You should have been the last one to do that.
I know Tom's a farmer, but I don't know where his farm is.
Tom says the matter is urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like to do that.
What could go wrong?
No one could have stopped that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
I know I said I'd do that, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom's too emotional.
I'm immune to pocket.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my couch.
My class was cancelled.
Tom and Mary told me to be gone by the time they got here.
Tom promised me he'd be here at 2:30.
Tom said he thinks Mary can take care of herself.
It's not as cold here as I expected it to be.
Tom said he just got back from Australia.
I don't think I'll be alone.
I can't work now.
The game is about to start.
Tom said Mary was born in Boston.
I don't think Tom will be surprised.
I know that Tom would be willing to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was jealous.
Does anyone else know you're here?
Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo.
Tom said he thought Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know that Tom wasn't planning on doing that?
I know that Tom knew who was going to do that for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said he didn't think the noise worried Mary.
No one ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knows that we.
Tom said he thought those shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he knew he might not need to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom will lose.
They told me they were next.
I suspect Tom and Mary are not as eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't ticclish.
I know that Tom did that just to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they ate too much.
He's old enough to drive a car.
Tom said he thought he forgot to lock the door.
I know that Tom is afraid people may laugh at him.
Tom said Mary was probably still mad.
Tom and Mary say they feel better now.
They hate foreigners; I hate everyone.
Tom said he's not sure Mary can swim.
I don't know if Tom will come tomorrow or not.
They said they were very busy.
I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
I think Tom is the only one to do that.
I didn't think you would win.
I don't think Tom will have the time to do that with us today.
I know that Tom's very opinioned.
We can't let these starts push us around.
I don't think Tom know who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew Tom knew who could do that and who couldn't.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom is not so sure.
Everyone here knows we don't eat pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
I think Tom doesn't know how to do that.
I've already told Tom I don't plan to do that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It's not healthy to skip meals.
I'm glad to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I suspect Tom and Mary are those who did that.
I bet I can sit here longer without saying something than you can.
It's not done yet.
I know Tom's not on the team anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that.
Tom just turned the radio on.
Tom has already decided that he's not going to say yes.
I know Tom's a bit snobby.
What's in the box?
Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said he would have done that by himself if he could.
Admitting that there is a problem is the first step to fix the problem.
Mary said she planned to go.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be absent.
Tom said Mary lied.

Tell Tom I'm coming.

No one knows exactly where Tom will go.

Some think it's a bad idea.
How do I know you're not gonna try to kill me?

This isn't the first time I've done this.
If Tom can't do that, probably nobody else can either.

I would never do that to you.
Tom should have been faster to do that than Mary.

That's not what Tom really needs.

I thought you were going to kill me.
I think there's a chance that Tom will do that.
It is surprising that they should have a second house in America.
They told me they were depressed.
My mother can't drive a car at all.
There's a lot that's happening right now.
I wonder if Tom is rich.
It's not necessary for me to do that.

I think you're boss.
Tom backed his car up to check, but the raccoon he had run over was dead as a doornail.

Tom must have left his paraply on the bus.
They told me they're broken.
No one but Tom did that.
I don't think Tom will be surprised that that happened.
I suppose you're not interested in going with us.
It's not easy to be understood by everyone.
I'm hungry.

I thought you might want something cold to drink.
Tom told me he wouldn't go to Boston unless I went with him.
No one's seen them.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sleepy.
Tom said he would definitely do that this week.
That's not my responsibility.
I think Tom is a student at Harvard.
I didn't know I was doing that the wrong way.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Tom told Mary he didn't think John was happy that was going to happen.

I thought you said I could count on you.
Tom said he sold his car three weeks ago.
Tom spent the money his grandmother had given him on books.
This is the first time I've been away from my family for more than three weeks.
You should have said that at that time.

Tom told me he didn't have as many friends as Mary did.
I've parked my car here many times and nobody's complained.
Tom said he was sad.
Tom said he didn't think Mary needed to tell John what to do.
Tom said he was going home.
I didn't know Tom was going to be arrested.
I know I'm gonna regret this.
Tom thought Mary was bored.
Tom thought Mary would be ready to do that.
Do you have any idea when Tom is planning to get here?
I know you're not planning to stay in Boston.
I wonder if that could happen again.
I suspect Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I couldn't keep looking at it.
I think Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French.
The evidence currently available does not allow me to make such a claim.
Tom said he's very sure Mary needs to do that.
Tom would have been happy if you had done that.
Tom said he wants to talk to you.
I thought you were a doctor.
I don't think Tom know Mary's phone number.
Tom said he needed to stay home.
I thought you were happy.
I could have stopped it.
It's not healthy to eat and run.
I didn't think Tom would be forgiven.
Tom said Mary was asked not to do that.
We're invited to dinner.
Tom and Mary said they felt repulsive.
I know Tom's afraid he'll be lost.
I ate the same thing Tom did.
I know that Tom would be able to convince Mary to do that if he tried.
Tom thinks I'm missing a great opportunity.
I know Tom's not a very good guitar player.
Tom and I were both impressed.
Everyone knows Tom's lying.
They're not as young as they say they're.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Did you know that Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I never thought I'd go there.
You know that's not true.
I know Tom and Mary both have already left Australia.
You're not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they felt the same.
Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom thought you could take care of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
Tom has decided he's not going to work today.
Tom denied that he was the one who asked Mary to do that.
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught.
It's not going to work out.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said Mary thought John may not be allowed to do that.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom told Mary and I that we should try to do that by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I wouldn't have been able to do that without your help.
I knew that Tom really didn't want to do that by himself.
Tom said he's looking forward to his retirement.
Whether we do that now or later doesn't matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should have anticipated that Tom wouldn't get along with Mary.
I think it is very unlikely that Tom was not aware that he would not be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
I wonder if Tom really knows the combination to this safe.
Someone's singing.
Mary doesn't plan to do that until I tell her.
I didn't know you were supposed to do that this afternoon.
Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
I didn't realize Tom didn't like Mary.
I don't think that can be fixed.
I didn't think Tom really wanted to know.
Tom didn't even know Mary used to live in Boston.
I didn't know you needed to do that today.
You should have registered your children months ago.
I think it's not mine.
I think Tom is thirty years old.
Think about it.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
I didn't think anyone would like Tom.
I thought Tom might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I didn't think anyone had ever done that kind of thing before.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning to stay.
That's not something I know how to do.
I think I'll be able to fix it myself.
I didn't think anyone did that.
Tom said we'd get lost.
Tom said he should do that.
Are you sure Mary said she was planning to do that tomorrow?
There were times I would have been lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom told me he thought Mary was crazy.
Tom already knows that Mary did that.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
It's not going to end well.
I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote in all caps.
Tom will be very happy he didn't.
I don't think Tom needs to do that alone.
If I were you, I would go home at once.
It's not like you knew what they were going to do.
Tom and I are planning to stay together.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
So what are you suggesting?
Tom said he learned something new.
I know Tom's married.
Tom said he thought the economy was in bad form.
I thought you had something to do with the jury.
I've been studying English for three years.
Tom is the only man I'd ever consider marrying.
I didn't think Tom would be awake when I got home.
Tom told me he thought Mary was paralysed.
I know Tom's not planning on doing that.
Tom didn't know you were from Boston.
It's not as difficult as it sounds.
Tom and Mary shouted, but no one heard them.
Tom and Mary say they want to swim.
Tom said Mary was probably still lonely.
I didn't think Tom would be arrested.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to join the team.
You promised not to be rude to me anymore.
Tom thought it would take longer.
I wonder if Tom knew he needed to do that.
I think Tom's like that.
Tom had all sorts of problems.
I knew Tom would like you to do that for him.
I thought Tom would want to see this movie.
I think Tom's still undetermined.
I'm Tom's dad.
I just want to let you know that I think you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Tom said he would do his homework before dinner.
Tom stared at Mary and said nothing.
I wonder if Tom's really sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they want to die.
Tom said he's had enough of that.
I suspect Tom's on vacation.
Tom told me he was too tired to study tonight, so he just wanted to watch TV.
I don't think Tom's very bright.
Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that before John came here.
Doing that would have been easy.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do that by himself.
That's very good.
Tom says he wasn't the one who broke the window.
It was clear that Tom was going to do that.
They're not sure they should do that.
The type of information we need is not always available.
I'd rather not talk about it.
I didn't think anyone saw us.
We can't turn back.
I know that Tom knows we shouldn't do that.
You didn't know I didn't have to do that, did you?
Tom suspected it was too late to help Mary.
Tom and I both sat back.
Tom was wearing the tie that Mary gave him.
Tom and Mary said they were not alone.
The question is not as much what it is like how it looks.
I know Tom's almost always right, but this time he's not.
Tom said to do that wouldn't be dangerous.
You're my hero, Sami.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom said he felt insulted.
Tom knew Mary would win.
Tom and Mary said they don't want this.
It's not about them.
I thought you said you wanted to do that by yourself.
Tom must have had a key.
Tom knew there was a possibility that Mary would do that.
You're so lazy.
Tom and Mary said they were not Canadian.
Tom and Mary told me they were famished.
It is not socially acceptable to point to people.
Tom would have allowed Mary to do that.
I wish we'd stayed in Australia for another week.
Here's the map you were looking for.
I thought you said you would never do that again.
Tom knows why Mary is planning to go to Australia.
I wonder if we have to do that.
I know Tom will never forgive Mary for doing that.
This is the third time this week Tom has done that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are going to say anything about what happened.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't be doing that today.
Tom says everyone he knows can swim.
Tom said he had a shovel in his pickup truck.
It was clear that Tom liked to do that by himself.
I don't think what I did was wrong.
I knew Tom was afraid.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long.
I thought I'd find you here.
It's not clear who wrote this letter.
They must have been tired.
Tom's doing OK.
Tom said he thought he didn't need to do that.
Tom said Mary knew that he might not want to do that until John had time to help him.
I didn't think Tom would like that.
I should never have brought you into this.
I think everyone trusts me.
I was surprised when Tom told me he wanted to do that.
I hope I'll see Tom tomorrow.
How much water does it take to fill your swimming pool?
Tom said Mary is probably still grouchy.
Tom said he thought Mary would unlikely want to do that.
Tom said he'd come, but he never showed up.
I doubt that Tom has the courage to do what really needs to be done.
Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really plans to do that this week.
Tom's going to be able to do that at last.
The doctor advised me to leave jogging because it was too excessive exercise.
Tom said he wasn't ready, but Mary said she was.
I don't think Tom will be back.
Nobody was on the bus.
Tom said he hoped Mary could win.
Tom thought he'd lost his wallet, but finally found it after searching the house for an hour or so.
Tom told me he wasn't impressed.
I didn't think anyone really expected you to be here.
It was clear that Tom hadn't done that yet.
Tom and Mary are planning to go to every bar on this street.
Tom said he thought I might have to do that soon.
Did you know your socks don't match?
You know that's got to be done today, don't you?
I think Tom's about to start crying.
She took him by the arm.
Tom said he felt intimidated.
It's not worth the effort.
Somebody's waiting in your office.
I'm sorry we pulled you into this.
Tom said he's not thirsty.
Tom told me Mary did that wrong.
I knew Tom could get hurt if he tried to do that.
Isn't that what you would have done?
Tom told me he thought Mary would be courteous.
I guess that's not really important.
Why is Tom wearing a cap?
Tom said Mary was able to do that too.
That's a mistake a lot of people do.
I don't think I'll be in Australia next week.
I know Tom didn't know I couldn't do that.
I know that Tom is much younger than Mary is.
It's not a easy solution.
Tom said his mother never loved him.
Tom should have stayed longer.
Tom knows he's in real trouble now.
There is no doubt that Tom will do that for us.
I don't have anything to say to Tom.
I don't think Tom know what I'm planning to do.
The men are wearing short sleeves.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
I knew that eventually this would happen.
It's not hard to guess what's going to happen.
Tom will never hurt anyone.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not be required to do that by herself.
I thought everyone knew.
I'm afraid I don't know.
Beauty lies in the eyes of the one who sees.

Tom said he'd be home for dinner.
It's not a secret anymore.

Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
Tom thought Mary was John's girlfriend.
I can't stand this noise.
I know that Tom's much better doing that than Mary.
The police believe Tom and Mary were murdered.
I guarantee that's not going to happen.
Tom claims he was born in 2013.
I don't think Tom's tough.
Tom has decided that he's going to say yes.
I hope Tom's not dead.
They said they don't do that.
Tom knows this is a difficult situation.
Tom knew that what he was going to do would make Mary angry.
Tom could have done that without Mary's help.
Tom thought he might not be required to do that.
Tom asked Mary if John was planning to stay.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be mad.
Tom said Mary was willing to make the cooking.
I hope I don't start crying.
You should've done that with us.
I don't think it's impossible.
I know Tom's a pretty good swimmer.
Tom has not been appointed chairman yet.
I wonder if there's any cheese left in the refrigerator.
What are you good at?

Nobody's done it yet.
Tom said he didn't want me to worry.
I know that Tom will do that with me this afternoon.
We're not planning to do that together.
Let's check why your answers differ from mine.
They told me they disagreed.
I don't think Tom was upset.

Tom is also a member of our group.
My parents don't allow me to do that.
They told me they didn't win.
Tom said he wasn't having fun.
I think Tom was in love with Mary.
Tom was not very energetic.
They say they like marigolds.
"Is everyone talking about me?" "No, Tom. You're not that important."
I don't think it's hard to do that.
It's not something I'm proud of.
Are both Tom and Mary still sick?
I can't believe you did that.
I knew Tom wasn't done that yet.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom should go home.

Every man cannot be happy.
I promise I won't do that.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes to do that.
I swear I'll tell you everything some day.
Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising times of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often, the oath is taken in the midst of gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not just because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our predators, and true to our founding documents.

I was the only one there that knew that Tom wanted to do that.
Tom says he intends to win.
I know that Tom rarely does that anymore.

There's no way you're going out dressed like that.
If we don't take the threat of meteor strikes seriously, we'll all die.
You're embarrassing.
I don't think Tom know why Mary needs to do that tomorrow.
It's not that weird, is it?

What the hell was that supposed to mean?

I thought you wouldn't like Boston.
I think there's a good chance it'll rain tonight.
I love you and I always will.
No.
I know Tom's not a very good hitter.
I don't think I'm the best person for the job.
They say they'd be willing to help us.
It is not open for debate.
Tom told everyone he was unemployed.
I know that'll be hard to do.
How are you planning to do that?
It's beyond me.
I'm a little out of shape!
Didn't you know Tom was seeing someone else?
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were cute.
I thought you had learned that by now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom's as smart as Mary.
They wish they hadn't said that.
I wonder if Tom is planning to finish his job.
Tom told me he hoped Mary would be motivated to do that.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad no one's around.
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give her.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn't defend himself.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.
I know that Tom will probably know how to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be grim.
I know that Tom knows why we didn't do that on Monday.
Who's your favorite singer?
I promise you I'll help you.
Tom said he knew Mary might not want to do that again.
Tom thinks he left his paraply on the train.
I'm much higher than Tom.
I know Tom can speak French. I wonder if Mary can, too.
I know that Tom would be faster doing that than Mary.
My handwriting is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I assume this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I always suspected that Tom was a little paranoid.
I know that Tom knew I was planning to do that.
You should have been able to do that much better.
We work every day but Monday.
I know you weren't the ones who did that.
Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it.
I know Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he probably would cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one there who knew that Tom didn't want to do that.
I very seriously doubt that Tom did that on purpose.
I thought you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do that by ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something about that the other night.
Tom admitted he was not brave.
I know I should have done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
I suspect Tom's waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead cannot bite.
I don't think Tom's as crazy as some people think.
I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
She avoided his eyes.
Tom's not as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that by myself.
Tom says Mary is still planning to do that.
I thought Tom must be wrong.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he was doing.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should have introduced myself.
Tom said Mary is looking forward to retiring.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never fell in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom has ever complained about that.
Tom's liked by everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you were crazy.
He doesn't have a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John may not be allowed to do that by himself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I suspect Tom is involved.
How many pounds have you lost?
Tom and Mary are both okay.
I'm a disgusting human being.
I'll never forget the time you and I went to Australia together.
Tom's not the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary both decided not to leave.
Tom told me he's sleepy.
Mary tried her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted that he stole Mary's bicycle.
I cried off the deck.
Tom said Mary was likely to be in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you are.
When's your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would have helped you.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they don't care.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun doing that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been on a diet for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary already had a driver's license.
I know that Tom is a fairly good drummer.
Tom realized that he wouldn't be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should have done that alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weather habit.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I suspect Tom's at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they would do that again.
Tom threw up.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to get married to Tom.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned.
Tom didn't stay in Boston for as long as he wanted.
Tom said he's a Canadian.
I'd like another cup of coffee.
I suppose Tom is still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone he knows enjoys doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know that Tom probably can do that sometime today.
Do you let your children play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts that Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the desk.
I think Tom is unkind.
I don't think Tom know when it happened.
Is it true Tom is moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess these days.
I don't think I would like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary should have done that by herself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was misled.
What you're saying is absolutely wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary is thirsty.
They said they didn't enjoy doing that.
I'm peeling apples.
They said they would never study French.
They said they thought I was creative.
Tom told me he's uncertain what he should do.
Tom told me I should have said yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There was nothing left in the refrigerator.
Tom said he knew Mary might not need to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't probably have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know Mary couldn't speak French very well.
I don't think there's any chance I'll get there in time.
I think Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he's not planning to go with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom's sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everyone loves free stuff.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does, I will, too.
I know Tom's still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they're ready to help me.
Tom's not the one who told me Mary should do that.
I thought you said you would still like to do that.
Tom said he was wondering whether Mary wanted to do that or not.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom's a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they really didn't expect anyone to do that.
Tom said it was Mary who told him he should do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary is annoyed.
I don't think I can hold on much longer.
Tom's not as high as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat worried Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom I disagreed.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
I believe everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to call attention to that.
Tom said he knew Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom said Australia is a nice place to visit.
I thought Tom was in great trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted for three hours.
I wonder if Tom is alive.
I might try to borrow a hatchet from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anyone would want to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares.
I think Tom won't be in Australia very long.
Tom told Mary he'd never come back here.
I didn't know you couldn't do that by yourself.
I suspect Tom will never agree to do that.
I don't think Tom know what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is irresponsible.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know that Tom is more likely to do that today than he was yesterday.
I think Tom's doing something illegal.
Our streets flooded when we have rain.
I'll probably be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have a lot of choice.
Tom said he thought he could do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew that Tom might be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know that Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has an idea of what Tom is able to do.
Tom knew he could have done that better.
Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do that by herself anymore.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unpleasant.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I am a university student.
I think Tom didn't, but I could be wrong.
What country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've made enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know that Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she needs to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by myself.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that's not going to happen.
Tom plans to sit in the back.
Tom said he'd given a book to Mary.
It would have been incomprehensible.
I know that Tom will probably know how to do that.
I know Tom was a scared kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly blamed.
I'm not surprised that Tom plans to do that.
Hardly anyone expected Tom to win.
Don't twist my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job would be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put on your jacket if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long.
I hear you've given up smoking.
Of course, Tom doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes to do that very much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said Mary knew John may have to do that by himself.
Tom said he was good speaking French.
This is not salt.
Has anyone here seen Tom?
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room as I do.
He didn't keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he's planning to do that.
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know that Tom can speak French better than I can.
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary had been careful.
Tom was sleeping on the living room sofa.
I found out both Tom and Mary like romans.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I suspect Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone he was prepared to do that.
We'll go to a picnic if it's fine tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone
It's not Tom who needs protection.
They said they're irritated.
I think Tom will probably be able to do that.
Tom did that whenever he could.
They said their houses weren't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
I think we have more important things we should do now.
I think Tom and Mary have been to Boston at least once.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary she should stop pretending to be sleepy.
Anybody please help me?
I know Tom's about the same age as your daughter.
I know Tom's a very lucky guy.
Tom thought I might not be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's going easy.
I think Tom will be lonely.
It seems like Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary's got to settle into her new flat.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you plan to do that.
They swore that they would never do that.
Everyone stood there, shocked.
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I regret I wasn't as careful as I should have been.
Tom doesn't look too good.
Tom said he thought I should do that by myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary is sleepy or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did that, weren't you?
They wish they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I've seen Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like to do that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary right now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did.
You shouldn't just assume Tom's guilty.
Watch yourself.
Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Someone's got to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know that Tom did that when he was thirteen.
Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him.
Enough is enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know that Tom did that?
I guess it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It is not until you have lost your health that you realize its value.
That could have hit me.
They told me they're losing weight.
My house is not big.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know I was still planning to join the team, didn't you?
The bathroom was not very clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he didn't think he'd ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him.
Tom thought Mary would be the first to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ambitious.
This is something I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music.
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's been ill for three weeks.
Tom said he wished he could speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom has no prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know that Tom knew I was the one who had to do that.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I've left my paraply in the phone booth.
I did a bad thing.
I suspect Tom would be interested in doing that.
I've promised Tom that I would do that.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's too good to be true.
Tom said to do that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to be obedient.
Courgettes are green.
I should never have broken up with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom cast his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you tell me the truth?
Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that.
That's just not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
Tom says he and Mary will spend Christmas Day together.
Why did you fail in the entrance exam?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says he can't prove Mary did that.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were bored.
Tom said he's happy you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really mean.
I know there'll be a lot of good food at the picnic.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I suspect Tom is reluctant to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd rather come next week.
What are you referring to?
Tom said he thought Mary was amused by what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same thing.
They are inseparable.
Tom didn't know you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must have done that last year.
Could you take a picture of me?
We should have expected that to happen.
It would have been wise to do that.
Tom told me he doesn't have a problem with that.
Tom said Mary shouldn't have walked home by herself.
Tom must be irritated.
For how long has your head been hurting?
Thank you, bud!
Tom said nobody was fired.
Do you think we should have gone to where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
He has earache.
I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said it was Mary who told him he needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
I'm assuming that the gunhot I heard was the one who killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.
I know Tom's a millionaire.
Tom said he thought that doing that would be safe.
I don't think I'll let Tom do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit I've done that.
I think Tom doesn't eat meat.
I hope we don't have problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
This is the first time Tom ever complained about the noise.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom is a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I think Tom won't be the last to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom's downstairs.
I need to know we can depend on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that.
I realize that that's not very likely to happen.
They say that drug is not safe.
I know it's very unlikely that anyone can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said he thought it would be a huge mistake to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom thought Mary would probably not cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That would never have happened if you did what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heater.
Does anyone have a clothes?
Tom told us he thought he could become a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom is a hemophiliac.
I wouldn't have said anything.
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and I both are wrong.
I suppose you still enjoy drinking beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were able to do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom's the person you should talk to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to study French.
You're not obliged to do that, are you?
You have a big head.
He's very smart.
I would never have rented Tom.
Does Tom know that you've already done that?
Tom ate more than I ate.
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom said Mary is probably still willing to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said he thought I wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
I hope this is enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know that Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary will get hurt if they're not careful.
Tom would have done that.
I didn't know Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that.
I would like to visit Boston again.
Teaching and studying my time is taken up.
I think Tom's conceited.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did.
I know that Tom doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that.
They say they'll stop doing that.
Tom's incompetent.
Tom thinks Mary drinks like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary said they told you.
Tom said he thinks Mary can't do that.
I know Tom's a golfer, he might teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew that Tom would be able to do that without any help.
I suggest you're not going to Australia in the winter.
What else do you plan to do?
I think Tom understood everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom's talking.
It's not my business.
Mary has a large postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I suppose you would like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom know when Mary came back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary good night last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew Tom wasn't a bad student.
It's unlikely that Tom will do.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campsite?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should've stopped while I was on.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmother texts faster than you.
Do both Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you would do that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone noticed what you were doing.
I wonder if I could help Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know this isn't hard.
I suspect Tom and Mary are not ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I assumed Tom had told you I would be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia all week?
Tom said he didn't know that at last Mary was going to leave him.
You're not afraid yet, are you?
I thought you would cry.
The value of health cannot be overestimated.
You'll suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom know exactly how much it will cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know Tom's nice.
Tom already knows Mary is planning to do that.
Don't take off your gloves.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wasn't going to do that again.
Tom should have been able to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary was feeling sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put your pants on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know that Tom isn't the one who's supposed to do that.
I admit I've despised Tom since the first time I met him.
Are there many Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the television guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It is true that the earth is round.
Tom couldn't help smile.
Tom doesn't like people to know he can't speak French well.
Check that girl out.
Tom told Mary she should stop pretending to be disabled.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
Tom thinks that's a mistake.
I knew Tom was a reasonable guy.
Tom thought Mary was downstairs.
I didn't want to admit I couldn't do that.
Tom said he was ready to do whatever was necessary.
Tom said he owes Mary a lot of money.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat dinner with you.
It's not safe to go out after dark by yourself.
Did you know Tom had a son?
Tom knows Mary likes Boston.
Tom and Mary said they're not likely to win.
Tom told me he had been forgiven.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows there's only one course of action possible.
Tom and Mary said they tried very hard to win.
They say they lost their keys.
I've decided to never do that again.
I didn't know you were dating Tom.
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary that they are not required to do that.
Good job, guys!
I know that Tom doesn't know that he's not supposed to be doing that today.
Tom and Mary say they didn't want to do that.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
Don't you know everyone's talking about us?
Tom said Mary knew he didn't want to do that until next Monday.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think Tom's sad.
I don't think Tom will really win.
I would've wanted to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was strict.
Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that by herself.
We wish we could have done more to help.
Tom said he thought it would snow tonight.
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
Tom said he would look at it.
Tom said to do that was more difficult than he thought it would be.
You would've loved the movie.
They told me they don't really care what's going on.
Tom's speech wasn't as long as Mary's.
I didn't know that Tom would be willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I worried you.
Everyone seems to be afraid but you.
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything.
Was the book you were reading yesterday in French?
I'm a harmdoer.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could've gone.
Tom said he didn't think the smell worried Mary.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
I thought you were a better chess player than this.
I'm glad to see that Tom is happy again.
I thought Tom had already left.
I knew Tom wouldn't be able to keep Mary from doing that.
I don't think we have much time.
Tom said he's trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would have done that for me.
Tom is the finest person I've ever met.
I doubt Tom really intends to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary may not have to do that this week.
I know Tom knows he didn't have to do that.
To tell the truth, I'm not your father.
I don't think Tom will do that with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, right?
I thought you might walk Mary home.
Tom said he hopes Mary is trying to do that.
You like chocolate, right?
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.
Tom says he knows Mary can't speak French very well.
Tom hasn't told me where he's planning to stay in Boston.
Tom didn't have to come here, he could just have called.
They said they enjoyed the challenge.
I know Tom was late.
Tom told me he was going home.

I think Tom was the one who wanted to do that.
I suspect that's not going to happen.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are really telling the truth.

I didn't want to admit that I was the one who broke the window.
Tom said he was expecting Mary to be there.
You're not leaving Japan for good, are you?
I wonder if Tom's really going to do that today.
How did you know I was going to say that?
I don't think Tom knows anyone in Boston.
Does Tom really think Mary enjoys doing that?
I haven't eaten anything for the last three days.
I thought you said no one was going to be here.
We haven't been told yet.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't be interested in doing that.
Mary says she's not planning to do that this week.

She's my favorite character.

They said they didn't want to leave.
I wish I could speak English as fluent as you!

I don't think Tom know if Mary likes him or not.
I'm not sure Tom would want me to give you that.

We're suitable to make mistakes.
I know that Tom didn't know exactly how to do that.
Tom said that it didn't sound logical to him.
They told everyone they were lonely.
We have to escape this place.
Tom would've liked to be here.
You should have worked harder.
I'm surprised Tom didn't show.
I wonder if or not Tom knew Mary couldn't do that.
I'm afraid I was playing coffee on the table clothes.
Tom told everyone he was fine.
I'm sure Tom would do that if you asked him.
I don't think Tom know how much time that's gonna take.
Tom thinks Mary lacks common sense.

Tom told me he hoped Mary would be gone by the time we got there.
Tom pretended he didn't notice that Mary was staring at him.
Tom thought he had to help Mary.
I'm going to New York next week.
This is an unusually difficult language.

I'm sure Tom needs to do that again.
Tom must have been tortured.
Last night I pucked.
Everyone here except I've done that.
Tom is almost as high as Mary is.
Tom told me he thought Mary was upset.
We need to protect our children.

What are you gonna do with all that money?
Why are you planning to do that?
I'm sorry I couldn't get to you sooner.
That's great!
We're sorry it happened.
I didn't notice that Tom was doing that.
Tom is about three years older than Mary.
It's important we do that correctly.

I always knew Tom could win.
You're welcome.

We're here.

They told me they'll join us later.
I suspect Tom and Mary are going to hate this.
Tom said he wished Mary and I wouldn't go out after darkness by ourselves.

I knew Tom was planning to tell Mary to do that.
I've lost three pounds.
The same thing must have happened to Tom.

Tom didn't read everything as carefully as he should have.
We know that Tom is unlikely to do that.
I knew Tom went to this school.
I'm afraid we'll have to start again.
I'm so sorry this has happened.
That is an interesting claim.
You weren't surprised that I didn't have to do that, were you?
I am familiar with this subject.
I don't think anyone really thought that Tom was as rich as he said he was.
She's not old enough to get a driver's license.

This is really hard.
Tom's gonna be surprised if you don't.
Tom knew Mary was with John.
I promise I'll be back soon.
Tom said Mary shouldn't have stayed at the party so long.

I thought you said you'd rather do that yourself.
Tom said he thought Mary would be scared.
Tom doesn't want Mary to know he doesn't know how to do that.

Tom should have told Mary that she was doing that the wrong way.
Call me!
You should've told Tom how you felt.
We will consider your suggestion.
Eating too much is bad for the health.
The paint's drying.
Tom may be lost.

Hi, my name is Tom!

Tom's miserable.
Didn't you know there was a good chance that this would happen?
I wonder if Tom will be at Mary's party tonight.

Who are you calling stupid?!
I'm calling my brother.

I don't think Tom is Mary's boyfriend.
Tom said he thought he should do that.

Tom told me he thought Mary had been fired.
It's not a bad plan.
Did Tom know you were planning to do that?
Tom convinced me you were the best person for the job.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't do that for him.

I'm afraid something's wrong with Tom.
The bill was hard to calculate.
I want to know who's coming with us.
I've never met anyone like you before.
It would have been hard to do that.

Tom will try to help Mary do that.
It could have been worse.
Tom thinks that doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
I'm sorry I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Tom and I both didn't go to yesterday's meeting.

They're welfare queens.
Not everyone is ready.
There's going to be a storm.
Tom must have been skeptical.
Where's the meeting going to be held?
I think Tom's wrong.
Tom said Mary thought John might not want to do that.

I thought you were still in Australia.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
I'm not sure that Tom and Mary both want to go there.
I don't think it'll take very long to do that for you.
I think Tom wants me to go with Mary.
I know you want to help.
Tom and I both stood up at the same time.
They said they didn't need to hurry.
I know you have more important things to think about.
I'm not deaf.
I haven't read all the books.
Tom should never have been put off.
Did you know that Tom isn't planning to attend today's meeting?
I wonder if Tom's ever asked Mary why she was fired.

I know that Tom used to be good doing that.
Tom wasn't the one who told Mary she didn't have to do that.
I knew Tom was afraid that the police could arrest him.

He's hard to please.
Tom and Mary said they were embarrassed.

I didn't think anyone else had noticed.
That cat is so cute!
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't know I wasn't going to do that.
I know that Tom is a mechanic.
A jack of all trades is a master of none.
I wonder if Tom is satisfied.
I know you still want to be with me.
Tom told me he was unemployed.
I didn't know you could understand French.
I doubt you will be happy with my report.
I should have known that Tom would do that.
Tom told me he used to live in Australia.
I'm glad you succeeded.
It'll take less than one hour to go there.
I knew Tom wouldn't pass the exam.
You may use my desk if you want.
I think Tom would agree with me.
Don't stay too long!
I know Tom's popular.
It makes sense.
Tom said he really did that without anyone's help.
I wonder if Tom is prepared to do that.
I don't think Tom would care if you did that today.
I know that Tom used to be a speech coach.
He can't swim a mile.
Tom said he's probably not going to do that.
Tom said Mary was upset.
I don't think Tom's a good lawyer.
Tom's gonna have to figure it out.
Are you absolutely sure Tom has to do that?
They said they hope it will happen soon.
Tom said he's not being used.
I thought I had nothing to lose.
By day break the storm was over.
No one I know really wants to do that.
I think Tom is expecting someone to make dinner for him.
They said they don't want to do that.
The price of benzin is so high that we can't buy a big car.
Why didn't you tell me you knew how to do that already?
Tom told me he hoped Mary would be discreet.
"Thanks." "What?" "For everything."
You're a teacher.
Many men, many minds.
Everything is possible.
Tom and Mary told me they were displeased.
Tom and Mary say they need to do that.
Let's hope that never happens again.
I don't think that actually happened.
Tom said Mary has been arrested before.
Tom said Mary's not ready.
I don't think Tom knows everybody's name.
Tom had trouble admitting him was wrong.
I thought you might want to play a game of chess.
Tom said he thought Mary would be impressed.
I know it's very unlikely that anyone knows me.
Tom said he wasn't sure he could do it.
Are you gonna be okay?
They told me they were familiar.
I thought something was seriously wrong with Tom.
Tom said he's not sleepy yet.
Tom assumed that everyone knew that Mary was going to do that.
I know that Tom probably shouldn't do that anymore.
I had no idea Tom could do that.
It looks like Tom's waiting for someone.
Tom said he thought Mary was probably having a good time in Boston.
You broke the computer.
I'm afraid you'll be lost.
They say they like to study French.
I don't think Tom know what Mary's favorite flower is.
I knew Tom was ready to do that.
I suspect Tom will probably do that.
Tom said he was going to stay up all night long.
I didn't know Tom was a veteran.
I thought this was what you wanted me to buy.
My daughter often experienced asthma attacks as a child.
I knew Tom didn't know you were the one who had done that.
We've already met everyone.
Tom said there were still a lot of things left to do.
You don't have a chance.
If Tom had enough money, he would have gone to Boston with Mary.
Tom told everyone he was happy that that would happen.
You're always doubting my word.
I didn't know I couldn't do what Tom asked me to do.
There's a good chance we'll win.
Tom says he knows Mary can win.
I know Tom's not a baseball fan.
I knew Tom would ask Mary to do that.
I think Tom shouldn't agree to do that.
I don't think Tom has sold anything all day.
I think I'm too old for her.
I don't think I should have left early.
I didn't say I was going to Australia.
Tom should have stayed in Boston for a few more days.
I should've told Tom before.
Tom and Mary said they didn't like to do that.
Tom'll remember.
It's not something I think I can do.
Tom told me where he was planning to stay.
I know you're not planning to stay in Australia.
I know Tom was impolite.
Do you have a pencil I can borrow?
Tom also wanted to do that.
I could've done that for you.
I think Tom's home.
It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women.
Tom should do everything they tell him.
Everyone but Tom knew he didn't have to go to Australia.
What is the most beautiful place in the world?
The storm caused a lot of damage to the crop.
I don't think everyone has given up.
Let's get our photograph taken.
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
Suddenly all the lights went out.
Tom and Mary said they'll probably win.
I think Tom would be annoyed if you did.
Tom and Mary thought they'd find other jobs.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
I suspect Tom and Mary were planning to do that tomorrow.
I didn't know you knew how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I know that Tom does that well.
Tom said nothing had changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know that Tom knows I needed to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know Tom's afraid he'll be fired.
If I were you, I would call the doctor.
I wasn't feeling very hungry.
I've done everything you've asked me to do.
Do you have a tie I could borrow?
I didn't think we would find anyone who could do that for us.
Tom is not an angel.
I think Tom's mad.
That sounds awesome.
Tom's driving over to Mary's apartment to give her something.
Tom said he thought Mary would wait.
Tom said he didn't think the smell worried Mary.
Tom said he's willing to do that for us.
Can you believe Tom is still only thirteen?
Tom sent Mary his picture.
Tom already knows that Mary doesn't plan to be here today.
They say they've never eaten Thai food.
I think Tom and Mary have never been to Boston.
They're playing chess.
I thought I heard someone singing.
I heard Tom plans to move to Australia.
It's not as hot here as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I belong here.
Nobody saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he might win.
Tom had no problems with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know you're not mistaken me for someone else?
You should've refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't.
I'm starting to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom should never have been released.
His train arrives at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said Mary thought that John might be required to do that by himself.
I know what I would do.
He doesn't have to bring the paraply.
Both Tom and Mary were not at home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I need to do that today.
Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
Tom told me you were with him yesterday afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know that we were those who were supposed to do that.
I'm so tired that I can hardly walk.
They felt that they needed to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but speak none.
You set up a trap.
I should have added more salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married.
I think Tom's messed up.
Tom and Mary say they'll never do that.
I think Tom's sorry.
You were shiny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could've got home by himself.
Tom and Mary both know who you are.
Mary said she's not planning to do that by herself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were impressed.
Tom hasn't told us yet what he needs to do.
I know you probably didn't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remembers where we first met.
If only you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he'd expect Mary to return to Boston on October 20th.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do that again.
Tom thinks you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I knew Tom told Mary he couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize that they're being ignored.
If Tom had left at 2:30, he would have been here by now.
Tom and Mary said they would do it.
There's no doubt Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom has decided to stay in Australia for another three days.
Tom said he thought I seemed unconcerned.
I should have stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I could do that.
I figured Tom would panic.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder if it will snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom's happy.
I'm freezing fish.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that by now if he was really planning to do it.
I know that Tom could do that if he really needed to.
We'll never know.
Tom admitted that he had killed Mary.
Didn't you know your stairlights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom's never going to hurt anyone again.
I'm learning Esperanto very quickly.
You're not gonna get in trouble for helping me, are you?
I've heard that women spend more on shoes than men.
I think Tom will be excited.
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do whatever he wants to do.
I thought you were gonna fix that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told he's not going to be allowed to do that.
They say they're unsure.
I know Tom didn't know he wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom should have told me earlier.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men excused each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John will actually do that.
They say they also need to do that.
I know that Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they'd help me.
I don't think I'll ever be able to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they're snoring.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tom said he'd found something.
A business is not a charity.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had ever been to Australia.
I don't think Tom's as good-looking as John is.
Tom said he thought that prices at that store were too high.
I don't think anyone disputes that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he hoped he could do that today.
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unafraid.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know Tom's not afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without any help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
Nobody asked me whether I liked it or not.
Many old people today can't keep up with the times.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know that Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he'd decide to do that.
It's a kind of cat.
Tom thought Mary would probably refuse to do that.
I'm sure you will succeed.
Tom denied that he had accepted the bribe.
Tom said he thought that doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
Can't this wait until morning?
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
We know that won't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his neck loudly.
I think Tom is unprejudiced.
I'm afraid I've lost it.
Tom said Mary was likely to be grumpy.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they used to be.
I know that Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do that today.
Don't talk about business while we're eating.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was tough.
I hope Tom will be adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She's got to be taken to hospital.
I would have helped you if you had asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wheat.
This is not a drill.
Tom should have done that a long time ago.
I think Tom slept all afternoon.
I wonder if Tom's upset.
Tom said he knew they couldn't let him do that at school.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes to do that.
Tom would have done that for Mary if he had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something is still not right.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I know Tom's not planning to go to Boston with you.
Tom said he's not sure Mary needs to do that.
I didn't think Tom could talk Mary to do that.
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know you didn't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said he thought that it would be fun.
I think you'll discover that it was Tom's fault.
I thought it was rather ingenious.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were the ones who did that?
Do you still plan to do that with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know what time you said you would be there, but I wasn't able to be there at that time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that's not true.
Let's assume that's going to happen.
Tom told everyone he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me he thought Mary was truthful.
It's quite likely that Tom will come.
I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
I didn't think anyone had tried that before.
You should have made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom said it looked like Mary had a really hard time to do that.
I'm learning Old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could have done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard to get along with.
They said they were very drunk.
You could've told me earlier.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceited.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know that Tom never does that anymore.
Tom says he swears only when it is absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom's high.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me he thought this book was interesting.
Tom assumed everyone knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he planned to go on October 20th.
They said they're doing all right.
Hostilities resumed between the two powers.
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everyone else in his family did.
I would have done that if I could have.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning to do that.
Tom assumed that everyone at school knew that he had been arrested.
Tom wished he knew how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he's seen Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said that he thought Mary was going to be able to do that.
I think Tom is the one who should tell Mary to do that.
Everyone knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My findings suggest that is not the case.
Tom found the watch he had lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Someone must have left the window open.
I know Tom's a messy person.
I'm sorry, sir, there must have been some mistake.
I know that Tom knew Mary was planning to do that.
Tom was just telling the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he would be able to do that in a few hours.
No doubt you'll be able to pass the examination.
Where's everybody?
How'd you feel?
Fortune favors the brave.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom had heard us.
It's not compulsory.
I hope no one comes.
What colour was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do that for them if they could find anyone else to do it for them.
Tom said he'd walk Mary home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should have hired someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was impressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me he was too tired to study.
Where's your baggage?
Both my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that's not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to help him do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's chubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom's going to be willing to talk to me.
Tom said he's happy Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you could get Tom to do that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, much less German.
Tom thought something bad would happen.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I know it's very unlikely that anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I both enjoy playing fullyball.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit he's wrong.
Tom said he was unable to win.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that anytime soon.
There's a chance Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know only one language.
She's a blonde girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing Mary did.
I know that Tom is a sophmore.
Tom definitely knew he shouldn't have eaten that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said Mary knew John may not have to do that until Monday.
Tom shouldn't have ever tried to do that by himself.
How's your father?
My son isn't a snob.
I would have let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was more difficult than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that alone.
I wonder if it'll really be hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said Mary knew she may not have to do that again.
They swore that they wouldn't do that again.
I'm not really going to do that.
I know that Tom will allow you to do that.
Tom said Mary would do that.
They've said they won't do that.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said he thought there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary wasn't done doing that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know that Tom could actually do that.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would.
Tom said he thought Mary was over thirty.
We went up by two floors to reach the apparel stalls.
I don't think Tom's funny.
Tom thinks he'll die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they'd be happy to help.
Tom and I both want to go.
I didn't know you would tell me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I could do that for Tom.
Tom promised that he would never make such a mistake again.
Don't you think we should have talked to Tom about this?
Tom told me he thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me he thought Mary still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the little stuff.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it's a very common problem.
Are you sure this will work?
I'm afraid I'll be tied up all afternoon.
I know you can hear me.
You seemed unwilling to do that.
Tom told Mary he thought she was doing it wrong, but she didn't care what he thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first-time offender.
I promise you that won't happen.
Tom said Mary thought he might need to do that.
Tom said he wouldn't ever try to do that again.
I don't think it ever worked.
Don't forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom has given me a lot of things.
I know Tom's a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know that Tom can't do that without any help.
Tom admitted that he lied to me.
Tom and Mary have told John they don't plan to stay at home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We're not quite sure exactly what we're supposed to do.
We both love Tom.
Tom said he hopes you try your best to do that.
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that this evening.
I don't think I know the man who's playing the drums.
This old man has liver spots on his skin.
Tom and Mary promised they would never do that.
Give me that candle.
Tom didn't seem to be aware of what he needed to do.
There's no time to explain.
Tom didn't realize he had to leave.
They said they were afraid.
Tom and Mary say they can't find their hats.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
Tom said there was still a lot of work to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassed.
Tom said he thought he was arrested.
Tom and Mary told me they were worn out.
I've heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to see Mary anymore.
They're living in a fantasy world.
They said they thought I was charming.
I didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you'll have a lot of fun doing that.
I suspect Tom doesn't do that as often as he used to.
I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to do that.
I plan to skip lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was afraid.
Tom has already told me he's decided to go to Boston next summer.
That doesn't make sense.
They say they're dying.
Tom offered to borrow me some money.
Do you think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea Mary didn't know what she was doing.
Tom told everyone he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom is a native French speaker.
They said they weren't planning to go.
They say they've taught French.
I suspect Tom and Mary are curious.
I know that Tom knows I don't have to do that.
You have to help Tom.
Tom told us he had a headache.
The bomb was defeated just minutes before it would have exploded.
Tom and Mary told me they would win, but they didn't.
I'm glad to hear it!
Tom and Mary say they don't know any French.
I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that.
You should've refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't approve of Tom's dating Mary.
Tom said that's not the main reason why Mary should do that.
Tom doesn't have a car and neither Mary.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he wasn't different.
Tom admitted what he said was wrong.
Tom could have been afraid.
Who do you think asked me to give this to you?
I've just been sick.
I hope I get a lift.
Tom said he didn't think we should even consider doing that.
Tom said he'd come if we invited him.
I don't think I'll probably do that.
Tom said he might cry.
It's Sunday.
Tom told me he wasn't tired.
I didn't think anyone really thought Tom was busy.
I think you know we have to do that today.
I didn't think Tom would actually do that.
I knew Tom would leave early.
Tom said he thought Mary understood French.
Tom said he needed my help, so I helped him.
I don't think anyone's lived in this house for a long time.
Tom denied he stole the money.
Tom said he hasn't yet decided what he'll do.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't like to go to Boston.
Tom said he thought tomorrow would be a sunny day.
Tom's obviously drunk.
I'm absolutely sure that's not going to happen.
Everyone was there except Tom.
I thought you promised to give that to Tom.
I thought you said you saw Tom this morning.
I think Tom was supposed to be here.
Tom and Mary said they had completely recovered.
I didn't know you weren't planning to do that by yourself.
I don't think there's any way out here.
There is no rose without a thunder.
Tom thought Mary probably didn't know that John spoke French.
You know I wouldn't do that.
I think we all know that's a bad idea.
I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
Tom was probably about thirteen years old at the time.
Tom and Mary said they were ticclish.
Tom said he wouldn't be able to help weed the garden today.
I wonder how Tom knew I'd be here.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was mean.
So, where's the problem?
Tom didn't think Mary was beautiful.
He will have to do that task again.
I know Tom didn't know anyone who could do that.
Only fresh roads are sold here.
I think this isn't a good idea.
Tom has already been asked not to do that.
Here's your change.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew long ago.
When was the last time you asked someone for help?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was shiny.
I know Tom's irritated.
I didn't meet anyone new today.
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I knew Tom was planning to do that.
Tom and I both don't speak French.
I thought you were ready.
I know Tom knew why Mary didn't like to do that.
I didn't think Tom was happy that that had happened.
They said they were very tired.
You're not old enough to get a driver's license, are you?
I don't think there's no harm to tell you now.
I thought you said you did that on Monday.
Everyone here knows Tom is in Boston.
Tom denied him with Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Austria is a parliamentary republic in the middle of Europe and consists of nine Bundesländer.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They said they're not thirty yet.
I didn't think Tom really needed to do that yesterday.
I thought Tom was already back.
Tom said Mary knew she might not be allowed to do that unless John does it with her.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were happy.
Tom said Mary thought John might be required to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I thought Mary was cute.
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to do that by herself.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy.
Did Tom say he stayed in Australia?
Tom said he'd pay for everything.
They told me they were not alone.
I don't think I can finish the job alone.
Tom said Mary is not safe.
Tom said I looked thinner than the last time he saw me.
They said they'd see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was concerned.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I don't think Tom know what Mary's gonna do this afternoon.
Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be cooperative.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary will be scared.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
I knew Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked him to.
We can't pretend Tom is normal.
Tom's amused.
Tom should never have tried to do that alone.
Tom and Mary said they would never do that.
I'm higher than him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conservative.
Tom said he thought Mary probably wouldn't want to do that on a cold day like today.
The teachers' room and the gym are under renovation.
Do you think there's any chance you'll be able to do that?
Tom put his glass down.
You would think that would have impressed Tom.
This is the first time I bought a newspaper in this city.
That's a good question.
Without water, we cannot exist.
Tom certainly understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.
Tom and Mary say they didn't agree to do that.
I know that Tom will be able to help us do that.
I had lunch three hours ago.
Tom said he appreciated Mary's help.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
You're the only one who can protect them.
Can anyone explain this to me?
Did you know that Tom was going to be in Boston all week?
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
I know Tom didn't know I wasn't going to do that.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom has a lot of things he needs to do.
Tom and Mary say they're not sure they're ready.
There is no logical reason for this.
I suspected Tom was intoxicated.
I hope I gave you enough money to buy everything you needed.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary enjoyed doing that.
They said they were feeling fine.
I wish you hadn't seen me do that.
Tom and Mary said they had no money.
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that.
Tom should never have got that job.
Tom told Mary she was his one and only.
Tom knew he wouldn't be expelled.
Tom was convinced that Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said he knew that was what Mary had to do.
I think you're terrible.
I wonder if Tom's going to Boston next week.
Tom says he didn't know Mary wouldn't go to Australia unless he went with her.
I know that Tom doesn't want to do that.
You're not an idiot.

Tom said he knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said Mary wasn't mad.
I think we bought everything we need.
Tom said he thought he might not need to do that by himself.
Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom's average.
You're not just working for Tom.
Tom said he knew that Mary might be required to do that by herself.
I don't think Tom know how it happened.
It's not a watch.
Tom and Mary said they're unafraid.
I'm from the United States.
I don't think Tom know how to have a good time.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
Tom seems unwilling to correct his mistakes.
I loved that book!
Tom said Mary wouldn't like to do that.
Tom said he felt safe.
Tom's homesick.
Did you know that would happen?
I think Tom believed me.
I don't think we can do that at 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary probably wouldn't do that.
I thought you said we weren't going to do that anymore.
I know that Tom doesn't know anyone who can do that.
I'm pretty sure Tom has a girlfriend.
I thought you might be the only person who would listen to me.
I know Tom didn't know Mary didn't.
Tom said he thought Mary would be nervous to do that.
That's the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me they were ambitious.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped buying a chocolate bar.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be excited about that.
I didn't know I was supposed to help Tom do that.
No matter what you say, I'm convinced I'm right.
Tom said he didn't need any more help.
We cannot make a change in our schedule.
I was shocked when I heard that Tom had been arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they're not supposed to park there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not really going to kill Tom, are you?
They said they'd be willing to help us.
Tom told me he'd done that.
Tom is not the same as he was thirty years ago.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this today.
I suspect that Tom won't tell Mary she needs to do that today.
America's Civil War lasted four years.
They say they're disappointed.
It is not always easy to distinguish good from evil.
Tom said he's going to try something he's never done before.
I don't think Tom's strong.
It's not too hard.
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
I suspect Tom and Mary are suspicious.
You're a prude.
Tom said he would have done that if he could.
I don't think anyone really wants to do that.
Tom said he wished he kissed Mary good night.
If you do, I will.
I think Tom is unreplaceable.
They told me they're tempted to do that.
I don't think I have everything I need.
That's not what Tom wanted you to do.
What book did you give to Tom?
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last year.
Tom and Mary say they're hoping they can do that.

I wonder if Tom's ever been to Boston.
It's not quite done.
Tom said he felt frustrated.
I know that Tom will do that with Mary.
I sent Mary some roses.
Tom said Mary was higher than her sister.
I wasn't as hungry as Tom.
Do you want to borrow me your dictionary?
I buy things that I know I'm not going to use.
Tom claims he didn't kill anyone.
Tom and Mary said they were very grateful.
How are you doing today?
Tom said Mary wanted to do that yesterday.
Tom told me he's not going to do that.
I know that Tom is much stronger than I am.
It was not a easy decision.
I wonder if I'm still able to do that.
I knew Tom didn't want me to do that.
Tom didn't tell anyone anything.
It's Tom's thirteenth birthday tomorrow.
Tom said he didn't think Mary really did what John said she was doing.
Tom and Mary said they were Canadian.
They hoped they'd be able to win.
Tom said he was happy that Mary could do that.
I should have told you everything earlier.
I thought you had another reason.
I think you shouldn't have bought that car.
Tom told Mary he was unwilling to do that.
I should have known Tom would be busy.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
Tom said he heard someone yelling.
Tom told me he thought Mary had to do that.
Tom thought I didn't have to do that.
Nobody asked for your help.
I thought Tom did that yesterday.
Tom was not allowed to board the plane because he did not hold a valid travel document.
Something's not right.
Tom believes Mary is trying to discredit him.
Tom didn't seem too angry.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't through doing that yet.
I think Tom won't be early.
Tom told me Mary was nervous.
Samurai lived by a code of honor.
I know Tom doesn't know when I did that.
Tom said Mary's been here before.
I can't believe Tom did that.
I don't think I've bought everything I need.
Tom said he had nothing to do.
I should have noticed it before.
I thought Tom was going to ask Mary not to do that.
I wonder if Tom wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought we might have a problem.
It rained for three days straight.
Tom thought Mary was pregnant.
When was the first time Tom did that?
Do you know if Tom and Mary are allowed to do that?
We told everyone we were moving to Australia.
Please do that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
I don't think Tom is married anymore.
Tom said he thought Mary would be alone.
Everyone knows Tom and I don't like each other.
I'll see you tomorrow.
They say they were hungry.
Tom said he should have done that.
Tom was cremated.
Tom said he thought Mary had already done that.
Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
I suspect Tom is still in love with his ex-wife.
I know that Tom knew that Mary was the one who had to do that.
Tom is very rarely waiting for anyone.
I just assumed that everyone would do that.
I don't think you understand what this means.
It's not possible.
I don't think you have the guts.
I've been busy since yesterday.
Tom said I shouldn't have tried to do that by myself.
Tom said he wished he hadn't tried to do that.
Tom was the one who told me I needed to do that.
I didn't think we could get home at 2:30.
Tom said he couldn't sleep last night.
Tom told me he thought Mary was creative.
Tom could have come yesterday, but he didn't.
I didn't know that Tom didn't want to do that alone.
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else.
I wonder if Tom was able to do that by himself.
Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't done it.
I suspect Tom will probably have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not as busy now as I was this time last year.
I would've talked to Tom instead of just ignored him.
I thought you wanted to meet my family.
I don't think Tom will be disobedient.
Tom said he was going to do that every day after he retired.
There's not much I can do to help, I'm afraid.
Both Tom and Mary are still not married.
I know Tom knew Mary couldn't do that.
We're at school together.
I would like you to look at these documents.
Tom's tired.

Tom and Mary said they were going by train.
I didn't know that Tom really didn't want to do that by himself.

I don't think it's a problem anymore.

I thought it would clear up in the afternoon.

He's a very loving father.
How did Tom know Mary would do that?

I didn't know Tom owned a gun.

It's not going to be as hard to do as you think it'll be.

Are you over 18?
Tom won't leave his children here with us.

I thought things would get better.
I hope Tom and Mary aren't faster doing that than I do.
Tom said he's happy you're back.

The way you're planning to do that is dangerous.
You should've come earlier.

I seriously doubt Tom will be there.

Tom picked up his bag and left.
I'm not the only one here who's not married.
Tom said he knew he might not need to do that again.
They know that they should do that today.
You should have been a lawyer.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't know I'm here.
I don't think I need to wear a tie to the party.
I don't think there's any reason Tom has to do that.
Tom said Mary was probably still pessimistic.
I don't think I could do that even if I tried.
I know Tom hasn't yet asked Mary to do that.

I think this is the first time Tom has done that.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be punished.
I know that Tom is a very rich man.

There's no hope.
Tom could've been camping with you if you let him know you were going.
I don't think Tom know why Mary kept doing that even if he wouldn't ask her to.

Are you good reading maps?
Tom says Mary's lying a lot.

Safety is not guaranteed.
Tom didn't offer to help.
I think Tom will be truthful.
I assumed Tom had told you I would be here.
Did you know I was going to be arrested?
She's a disgusting human being.
Tom already intends to do that.
Take off your school uniform.
I suspect Tom will have to help Mary do that.
I'm afraid I can't.
I know that Tom's almost as high as you.
The first time I met Tom, he was only thirteen years old.
Tom says Australia is his favorite country.
I suspect Tom has never done that.
I thought we could help out.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a kid?
I'd like to stay longer.

Is there anything I can do to help?
Tom drank less than Mary did.

You can't do many things at the same time.
I can't remember her name.
The father works.

I'll save you a piece of pie.
I thought I was going to be asked to give a speech.
It's a privilege to meet you.

You're more brave than me.
Tom said he was getting sleepy.
They said they tried to do that once.
Tom said he thought Mary would be in Australia for three weeks.
I should've told Tom not to believe what Mary says.
It would have been interesting to do that.
If you had told me before, I would have dressed up.
I think Tom's scared.
Tom said he's sure Mary can swim.
What's her problem?
I think Tom's focused.
I am not interested in this.
I thought the police were looking for Tom.
Why are everyone staring at me?
Tom has everything he needs.
They view foreigners with suspicion; I see everyone with suspicion.
I don't think I can do that better than you.
You could have let me know you'd be late.
Tom's delirious.
Willingness to correct is a sign of wisdom.
Tom would never do that.
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today.
It's not as humid today as it was yesterday.

Tom repaired his bike.
You're not really planning taking pictures, are you?
He's two years younger than I.

Give it back!
Tom said he thought Mary could help us today.

I wonder if Tom has another one.

I'm not sure that's possible.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Australia with me.

I don't think I could do that.
You're to blame.

I didn't know that Tom would be faster to do that than Mary.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Australia when they were children.
If Tom doesn't, I won't.
Tom told me he thought Mary was funny.

Dinner isn't ready yet.
I hope I'll be able to help you tomorrow.
Sure we could do that, but it would be really difficult to do.
I could've saved Tom's life.
There's a good chance that Tom will ask Mary for the dance.
Tom told me he found an interesting book about Australia at the local library.
I don't think we can take care of ourselves.
Do you need a lift?

I think you'll enjoy it there.
It's not all that ridiculous.
I wonder if we have to do that.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to do that today.
The fuse has blown.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
Tom should have been interested.
I wonder if Tom really wants me to do that today.
It's not good to ridicule people in the public.
We should have planned for this.

They say they never did that.
Tom and Mary said they're not going to do that.
I know Tom's connected.
Tom said he needed to spend a few weeks in Australia.
Let's get married.
Get the fuck out of here!

He leaves to Tokyo tomorrow.
I wasn't as helpful as I should have been.
