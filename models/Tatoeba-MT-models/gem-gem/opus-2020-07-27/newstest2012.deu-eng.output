No liberating novels for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament today refused the request to abolish the paragraphs under a novel of the criminal law on which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned.
The new regulation which could have been the way to liberate the arrested Minister of Expremiers rejected the Members at the second reading of the application for a milder punishment for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in October because of the conclusion of a supposedly disadvantaged contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet legal, in December the appeal of the condemnants is to be negotiated before the court.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as a political vengeance of the regime and also in the west, the process raised the suspicion of the court's preliminary ruling.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Minister for Foreign Affairs was condemned to be removed from the criminal law was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyan Victory
The history of libyan libyan libyan libyan rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual, this region wins in the elections of Islamists, the question is only which - the moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council recognized the customs law of the Sharī ́a, of which one has a certain idea with God.
Libya would go to the country without crime, because for stealing it is shortly hacking off the hand.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, any faith deceived, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be united from each other's tribes in the future.
In a short way - in Libya, a system will rule that would hardly be imaginable and, above all, little desirable to this country.
Only - our lifestyle isn't the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the fluctuation of the Libyans mentioned.
So it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were able to help by the unbelieving dogs at all.
For their excuse, it may only be the fact that the air attacks of the NATO were not led by any general from America, but by God himself, whose Almighty was praised after every successful hit.
The winner in Libyen?
We only took part in a shooting change, served the interests of Islam and our politicians disfellowshipped in the person of a political alliance's dictator without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefer to look away from a military occupation of Libya.
Thus, there is anxiety for the people who are here, namely the displacement of the cross drivers.
But do the mineral oil companies also get the black gold at the spott price without occupation?
It is hardly possible and so, at last, the West can commend himself with the right of its selflessness in matters of protection of human rights.
If this does not destroy the Sharīa representatives.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe focused on investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm depth broke through Europe.
Individual countries published their information on their GDP for the third quarter.
Compared to the pre-quartal, Germany and France, the Czech economy did not add.
However, the obligation market is taking all records today.
The investors are not only in Greece but also in Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, from France by 0.4%.
Both countries at the same time corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany reported a higher growth than originally expected (increase of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France granted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the prequartal, the gross domestic product and according to Tsch. Statistical Office confirmed the trend in growth slowing economic performance.
So the results are worse than the forecasts of analytics.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in this year’s third quarter compared to the previous year, but compared to the previous quarter it stacked.
According to preliminary and seasonal estimates, the German economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
In the entire euro area and in the EU, between July and September, the economy reported a growth of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, in line with the expectations of analytics.
The Greek economy decreased by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The yields from their 10-year-old government loans amounted to 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish government loans increased to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also begin to feel problems...
The return on Czech State loans is below 4%, even if the situation in the region is worse.
In Germany, the ECB is to become the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified themselves for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has lost the most difficult task of the entire season!
Thanks to a well-closed gateway Čech and a wonderful gate of Petr Jiráček, she won 1:0 in Montenegro.
With a great portion of happiness, the Czech football was able to defend its luxurious predecessor of home game and will once again not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz pursued the climbing game in a detailed reportage.
Low excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also defeated quite happy 1:0 thanks to the weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day of Jiráček in Montenegro and thus redeemed her ticket for the football EM.
Also, because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they could put the Montenegriners more pressure only in the second half.
The birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shot two giant birds.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will also be mixed next year with the European Championships, and it is also pleased that the domestic football will have a premium of approximately 200 million.
From the first few minutes on, a lot of fighting football was played.
Both crews combined long and so were mainly played around the middle line.
In the second half of the time, the pressure of the home crew remained, and the wide rejections from the criminal area were successfully defended by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are willing to die for the core programme of their country.
They formed a living shield.
Some hundreds of high school students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed Tuesday afternoon before the object and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university at the Iranian Isfahan were forming a living sign on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where Uran is processed.
So they wanted to make customers ready to protect the core programme of their country, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran seemed not to give up everything after its efforts to achieve a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, there is also a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed in the afternoon before the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack in the intention of making the Iranian nuclear programme most lame, the Israeli press, from the center of Isfahan, would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's attack target.
The food card of a fat-sick child: It doesn't break breakfast and eats for the evening break Worst
More than one third of the children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of children overweight.
Current surveys proved - adipous children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This once again shows how important the healthy development of a human is the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipous children, worsts are up to half more frequently on the table than in families where normal children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had in the past the information action under the motto "Adipositas is no coincidence" pommes to the evening break.
In families with pockers, sport is not just one of the favorite jobs, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Survey under 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools in all the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence" supported by the General Hospital Bank and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy cost and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the horrible increase in the number of children with overweight or even fatigue.
"For example, only half of the interviewed children indicated to eat five times a day, in the mode breakfast-second breakfast lunch-Vesper evening breakfast - one of the main requirements for healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and worst for dinner breakfast
Experts point out that relative minorities, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families are breakfast.
And in most families everyone's breakfast alone.
The worst thing was the finding that is not at all frozen in every tenth family.
Breakfast is considered to be the basis of healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that overweight children are often consumed in the families of unhealthy pommes.
And almost everybody - without respect for weight - drinks sweet limonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children interviewed are sporting, only less than half of their parents do that - only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own food plans from offered possibilities according to appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 in puncto diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Under their favorite foods, many meal foods, meat dishes and, of course, sweet foods were found.
"Alarming is especially the great popularity of sweet limonades," is stressed in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, i.e. the main court, dew goods were barely victorious from poultry.
The kids almost didn't like chicken fruits, and the popularity of fish and vegetable juices as lunch was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits when they receive correct information.
"In the control group of enquiry stakeholders who completed the questionnaire after the completion of the "Adipositas is No Random" lecture, a significant shift in preferences to the principles of healthy nutrition was in many cases indicated in the results of the project.
For example, this was evident in the sweet limos, where many children began to give usual water priority.
The children also crossed much more frequent poultry or fish as the main court of the day and were ready to eat less knees or sweet food.
Profis claims - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how to learn stylists, I had a little tasted that this was a little too much material for the beginning.
I didn't know what's going on.
Lectures from three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problem figures and a seminar on how this "in the place" is running.
It's gonna get worse.
The closer the test, the more information and practical tasks we have.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (not part of a single man in the course) how to attract a woman who has no ideally proportionate figure.
And that's most of us.
The one has one too short neck, the other have a too young figure without suitable curves and again others are molly.
It is a matter of the stylist to cashear wide shoulders optically, extend the neck or make up the necessary curves.
We also received tips on how to attract a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - so with a large bush, broad hip and narrow tail - beautiful and figuratively, without being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between valley and hips is so large that the rock or the trousers really do not fit, you should at least be cut to a measure.
I'm sure you won't regret that, because well-sitting clothes are simply unpaid.
In such a customized rock, you feel much better than in one of the stairs, which are all too high and shaken, in the valley, etc.
In turn, young figures can allow to wear clothing with folds, panties, applications, sticking or refining.
With this amount of information and figures, I am glad that I have a whole week of time to let everything go through my head thoroughly.
And yet I'm afraid it is almost not to be done in the face of the entrusted house.
Indeed, each of the students received a promi for which they should think about suitable outfits - day clothing and evening robe.
We should take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to take Miranda Kerr, which you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I am glad, because this is much better for me personally than to dress Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has probably increased to the hundred kilos in recent times (now well, that is a bit overdriven), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the clothing pieces out of magazines or search, print, and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is mentioned, then our entire personal style and our relationship to the graphic design will be expressed.
Indeed, it is very important to think about the graphic side of the styleing.
The stylist attracts the models not only physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to a specific standard, for example, trend handbags, males, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information on figures types, was equal to three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, by fashion creator Jakub Polanka and by fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to use this.
And an elegant stylist is able to work with a single clothing piece in quite different ways.
The magic word means variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat as usual over the Jeans, such as a T-shirt or a mantle, but you can also wear it on the naked body, dress it and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to crawl up the herbs or the crown and the whole look looks quite different.
"Game with it," he stressed.
But most of the advice was to me, "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"It's only then that you can hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally, I will realize why we need to pauke all these teachings, what you can combine with something and why, even if you often get to see quite different things in fashion journals.
Quiet from fashion views.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographed.
So you must be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (speak ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothes on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes look quite different than in reality.
So with all of that you have to count on the design of the outfits.
That image and style are sometimes half of the success, which also confirmed Jan Pokorný.
You just need Madonna to look at a not just brilliant singer, made a world star from the image and marketing.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Also known individuals think this often is money thrown out (the most important thing is that I bring something, as I look at it, is two-tangled).
And if someone of us can style, we should expect him or her to force us to a completely different (small) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to find with certainty that the Boulevard press writes, the corresponding promi has again grown or dropped, etc.
Jan and Mario put us to heart on Sunday not to believe that a stylist just focused on the fashion and then needed the outfit "to build together".
In his work he has to communicate with the people he styles and he must be a dedicated psychologist.
Appreciate people without offering them and standing in his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to sight her garage and to supplement beautiful pieces, then we can't wipe out the entire cabinet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to which you recommend what you can wear to it," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what needs to include such a so-called "platte bag".
So that's a bag that you're knocking on the valley and wearing all the necessary proprietions.
Besides such clear things, such as sharp, roller to the distance of the hair or safety needles, it also contains such utility such as a nylon thread (which helps the stylist to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are touched at the back, if it is too large (Stecknadles or other sticks are prohibited so that the substance does not break) and naturally necks.
But not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to stick shoes properly.
When photographing in the atelier, where the floor is just, you can damage the shoe soul, sweep the outside.
We sticked and we sticked...
You must not even touch the shoes with the sharp, so that you can't damage them.
So you really have to do it.
Mario rejoiced me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill mentioned is not just my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we got to hear at the second weekend course of continuation.
One thing has become clear to me now - to dedicate styling at a professional level is not a kid's game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original careless ride is made by a series of completely avoidable dilettant errors for routine travel to the early layer.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what is useful when obviously nobody wanted to do a little more.
Before he came to the store table, the new part woke up high expectations with the subtitle "The Run".
He promised that the already-old game series "Need for Speed" would move a piece back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples, he seemed to be not just one of many action plays.
We were also curious about how the adapted passages, in which the main protagonist rises out of the car and goes on to the foot.
But as you're already used in NFS, the end effect is much different from what you've expected.
Safely - possibly it is quite decent arcade races, but totally the game is defeated by some overwhelming mistakes that have been present in this series for more or less for a few years.
So there are actually no more mistakes, but rather signs of an in principle incomprehensible fault of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For the first time it is introduced into the history, whose main figure Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, you're going to run - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a number of interesting elements.
The whole route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is carried out on another route and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You have no moment the impression that game would always offer the same.
Some environments are still very beautiful to look at this, although the technical level of the graphics does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing of the world's movement.
But the ride through the desert, through autumn landscape or high above by deep cut landscape seems very pleasant visually.
Sometimes, untypical elements bring a little variation into the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that strongly limits the view.
In the mountains, you need to be careful that you are not thrown away by a lawn.
Besides, the individual races are quite well built together.
It's just a few, but it's enough.
For a while you are trying to overcome the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have picked up time (classic race against the stop clock), then you expect another personal dual with one single contradictor.
And that's what the police are going to do, who wants to fuck up the whole thing.
A news is passages where Jack leaves the car.
This is rather about some interactive animations where Jack flees from someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button in the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprised, however, that there are much less such passages in the game than you would expect (conkretly only three).
Finally, this is rather the advantage of the matter, because this element at least has no chance to become boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model runs into the footsteps of the previous parts.
That means, from today's point of view, it does not cut out trees, but it could not be claimed that it would be bad.
Those who are looking for realistic simulations must look around elsewhere.
However, an action-loaded ride will continue to be fair in this model, even though it could be better to find the competition.
Until then, everything's in best order.
Real problems appear only after some time.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not entirely OK.
From a game of this kind it is hardly expected that it is calculated complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no upstairs on any object knowing how the car behaves, then obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: When you closely pick up cars, or pass by, you can "stretch" at some places the other cars only easily, in other, almost identical situations, but you can get into the sleeves and turn wild piroutes.
Or the car is going to scratch.
Thanks to the restart system, this doesn't matter anymore, but it's all angry.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or land far off the route, then you throw the game back to the last point of point of the route.
Only - in every race you have only five restarts.
If you've exhausted them, everything goes from the front.
So the restarts are rather like a tool, in case something fails, but you should rather not rely on it.
Sometimes, though, it doesn't even help restart, there's nothing helping but learning the critical section from the head.
Explicitly unpleasant is that the same things often happen to the same places.
Some curves, for example, you have to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't pass through.
On the other hand, at the corresponding place, "civil" cars are always met in the same configuration, regardless of whether you are first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is particularly angry in situations when you see that the contrahent comes over before a playing on two counterpart cars, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you need to drive or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is so designed that it always comes to this situation close to your nose.
The contradictors have further advantages.
Over the whole game there are a few places where you are always overcome at the same place by the same opponent and again here without considering the time.
The most crazy is this to end the game on the long bridge that is happening in the opposite direction.
The contradictor must evidently get one out here on devil.
And then when he's already in front of one, he'll take a look, of course, so you can start driving your own car a few times in Clump.
Clearly - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intent is so clear that it quickly avoids the joy of the game.
And that is hurt, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and, in fact, also so charged to action that you almost don't know where one's head is.
And in principle no matter what "debt" is about it - the concept of fifty unique routes, the ordering of races in a way that no distress can come up, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the car change during the race.
You must not overlook the tank stations on the road, because right here you can change the car, although in most cases the car is enough that you have right now.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight motorways and exotic super-sport cars for technical travel, for example on the Serpentinian mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task mode (experiences) - the races in the individual localities you know from history.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for the own profile, which are common for the tasks (experiences) and history.
To reach the higher driver level, various items must be unlocked: starting from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares the own results achieved with other players and also provides further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible cutters is a situation in the last race of history.
In this case, you can get the car into a subway tunnel (mainway), where you're breaking long on the rails in the dark (mainway).
The tacho looks at numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (main roads), but at one time from the back a subway and rides a compromiseless to scratch.
In our editorial, we'll probably still argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is quite attractive in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
The more angry is that at some exciting moments, the image recovery frequency is slowing down and this sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this concerns, in particular, accidents with a greater number of participants, where a continuous FPS does not benefit anyway.
The sound playback is as far as O.K. and the sound track is taste case.
In endeavoring to address a scale as wide as possible rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "of everybody" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The total impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game was not deceived by the total unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have claimed with the breastton of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game works somewhat unfinished.
To yourself a class of pleasure, but you should be prepared to put this error in your eyes with the power of airport signals.

EU ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and Euroskeptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance between each institution feelably out of the lot."
I wouldn't have expected such a hard war to burn."
"It will take five, six years until the waves are smoothed and everyone will be used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador at the European Union, began quite sharply her speech at the legal faculty.
How serious she takes the motto "understandably and openly about Europe" she already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such an overlookable and understandable way that it could have envyed some of the teachers of the legal faculty of Karls University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairmen of the European Council of Herman Van Rompuy:
"From the beginning, criticism was loud that he was too unattended - a grey official who had not grown such a role, but I have to say that it has all swallowed the breath of how well he has accepted the matter.
"He is a man who makes it ready to patiently listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicate with them and have clear ideas of how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained it as an answer to the question: Who is this in fact - the European Union? What number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards the agreement and better readability of EU policies to states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our oil moulder Quargel
Ms Vicenová also dedicated to the agenda in which the European Union lived, lived and intended to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago referred to it as a success.
The Czechs had undermined the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the summit for Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the presidency called it a great negative, which greatly damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently full of hands.
With the words of the ambassador, not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, was quite arbitrary.
And there is still the seven-year budget of the EU to be approved, which makes the matter much more complicated just because of the current economic situation.
Whether it becomes a slight and spare budget, which sectors are given priority, which countries are more and less promoted - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also reminds her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Conscious about Europe".
"If I don't like something, then it's cruel accelerators, foreign words, and specialist jargon that nobody understands.
As a citizen, I should like to know whether we are really crumbing or round grains and various large bananas in Brussels or whether someone really wants to ban us the quarel.
It would also have liked to use the EU's soil to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU Messengers, the Czechs are calling to be Euroskeptikers who are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The worse is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
Many factors are due to this, including the retention of our candidates, whose inability to write motivation letters and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, which is so called V4.
"If you believe me when a pole or a kid comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, then the franchise next to me says, "Hey, what do you put your heads together - is this once again your V4?" and it makes a pretty sour mice.
According to Ms Vicenové, in the future, the EU expects hard rules for the budget policy of the Member States.
It considers the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds to be much more real, as a "European Federation".
"We have the countries of the Eurozone and the countries outside the Eurozone here.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institution of reinforced cooperation."
"For the first time it was said that only the countries who want to work together and those who do not want it should stand quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which eventually runs out to a strong "Europe of different speeds", expects Mrs Vicenová.
In this regard, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, which must be discussed by all the Member States and not only by the countries of the Eurozone.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters his existence in the second century
If you wanted to search for an appropriate word that the strategy of IBM is the most precisely characterized, this would probably be the word "Longevity".
For the wide public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern company, although it has gone a century since its foundation.
The foundation for this long-life has already laid her first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
He already represented the struggle, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a brand mark to play the life of the future giant (and at the same time as the title of the company-internal magazine that was started to be published at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis for the well-prepared business culture prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful throughout a century because it remained faithful to his principles and did not fear to change everything else.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society during our first century.
We hope that we will create more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Transparent system
Watson has already operated social care in the thirty years of his employees - in the same way as the entrepreneur Ba ́a in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had a vacation paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as working clothing and a thought-out remuneration system for best newer and dealer.
The long-term relationships of IBM with their customers are also echoed.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant in talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide raised any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan, the Palmisan at the top of IBM is replaced by a woman next year - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been in IBM for thirty years, so far it took the position of the Ve-driven, Marketing and Strategy Manager.
In recent years IBM has made so-called online brainstorms, from which many future strategies and innovations are growing.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company almost half a million people are busy.
An institution with good reputation
Your unshakable position in the business guarantees a strong image to the company and this to the inside and to the outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology business," said the professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony from Consulting-Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logos called for family "Big Blue", has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM has most patents and five of his employees have been excellent with the Nobel Prize.
Its most famous inventions include banking machines, credit cards, financial swaps, barcode or the floppy.
With approximately 220 billion dollars of exchange value (market capitalisation) this year IBM was the second largest technology company (along with Apple), with it overdue Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today’s customers - unfortunately, for example, the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or also the computer IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not bind yourself emotionally to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its base walls on different platforms - and if they do not work, leaving them again.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft, who in principle stands with his operating system Windows and falls.
Success-promising technologies
In the gains of IBM, services, software and hardware take part in a fifth part.
In 1990, hardware with a share of more than fifty percent was the strongest.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profits in the value of $15 billion, but at the same time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time whispered as a storm over the world.
Also here IBM remained faithful to the power of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment in the middle of the major world economy crisis.
So far it seems that the company IBM has overcome the current crisis.
The value of the IBM shares has increased by 120 per cent since 2008 and the company's reinvestment has grown constantly.
The company log of IBM is: everything can be changed - only the values cannot be changed.
It is therefore also possible to expect this flexible giant to master the next crisis.
IBM-History: From cheese cutters to world-all flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York a hundred years ago had a quite complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took her only in 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a establishment in Canada and South America.
The foundation of the later society IBM laid the merger of four companies whose history is back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous stamps cards to register the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who was chaired in the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who set up the head of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him with the management of the company.
This Leader then even put the founders of IBM in the shade - based on Watson's ideas to this day the inviable culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as already the name shows, began with the manufacture and sales of all possible machines for trade - from worst and cheese cutting, to boxes.
In the first four decades, in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to $9 million and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so vital for the company that he was sitting in the headquarters for forty years, only then he was triggered by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped the NASA flights to the All - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight of man to the moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System/360.
A classical PC that determined the computer standard of that time came to the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold his computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, she bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business with high added value consultancy services.
The strategy that IBM has paid in the last three years is the concept of smart planet.
It represents the intent to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned to date, such as improving the situation in transport and urban management.
In the trade sector IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help dealers run the whole commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM founded a establishment in the Czechoslovakia as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The Central Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and here is also a top research team of the world level that deals with the technology of voting recognition.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful companions:
Iveta - this ass you can keep, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her spouse Joseph Rychtář (53) of the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45) became his lover, Darina remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink red dream and come home.
But now it is definitely over with patience and for the rest of life it has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová of the singer I. Bartošová had commanded refuge in her own house, she wouldn't even have come into the dream of her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back to the river after 30 days, Joseph immediately went.
Yes, he even knew publicly that he loved them.
In time, Darina resigned, even it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful man - but now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytář doesn't care who sleeps with his wife
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not chase him out."
"Not as a loved, misled old donkey, but as a man to whom I still have certain bonds," said Mrs Rychtářová; but she also said that she has already emotionally separated from him and alone stands on mutual adherence.
The fact that Darina has locked him the back door has taken Joseph with dignity.
"My wife's decision I respect."
"I'm staying with Iveta, it doesn't change."
"My wife wants a paper egg and I respect that."
"The company continues to run, I'll take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I'm making the purchase."
"With Darina, I am very normal, only the bed we just don't share," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop it.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I realize that it's my fault, I've in love with Iveta, and that's why I take any responsibility.
The worst female distresses: What about you?
If you urge the men to call some typical female distresses, they will shake some immediately out of the herb.
Dear women, do you recognise in the following lines, in which we let a few unsite revue happen again that let the men wall the blood into the veins?
Purchase
Does their husband pretend to be shopping addict?
Do you have to buy at least one hat weekly?
Would you like to go shopping and may it be a bit more for actions?
Then, in your case, it's really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping desire half-steady under control.
But the hand on the heart, what woman does it already stand out to seek a well sitting upper garments just so by a clothes shop and not just try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is often the pure hell.
Well, think of how many times they said to her husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Isn't I too thick?"
"I should take at least five pounds - should I start jogging or making gymnastics?"
"Do I like you at all?"
Does this seem known to them?
Yeah?
Then you may also be among the women who are regularly occupied of how they look.
That doesn't mean you're supposed to leave, but many men respond allergicly to it when their wife is constantly sorry about her appearance.
The stronger gender agrees - with increasing frequencies of the complaints, women are increasingly intolerable.
Order and cleanness in the first place
It's a fight against windmills.
Cleaning windows, cleaning tiles and dust that shine the walls - and this at least twice a week.
If you thrust with her partner, because he once again tramps with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, the kids swallowed because the just shot washing pool is already dirty again and because the glass door at the living room is already having fingerprints again, where you're doing so much effort?
If you are suffering from this kind of "deviation", then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything, and the order and cleanness of family life are not the first place.
This measureless purity fime can eventually harm mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Tiles
"Smoth towers come into the washing basket."
"Do you really want to dress the old socks again tomorrow?"
"A naked towel isn't just throwing on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don't be surprised that it brings him to the palm.
Of course, this isn't bad, they just want what's all his order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not have needed so much to mecker.
Clasp and trap
Some women like to climb and climb, there is twisted behind the back or even ridiculated, or you're smoting allies.
Women are now focused on relations, so they like to hesitate through such issues, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a little harmless crap and trap in camps.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with climbing the most grave calibers, which are nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and which are particularly a major danger for women collectives.
Jágr and Voráček help Philadelphia with their assistants to win
The Eishockey Storm Jaromír Jágr had a large share in the Monday game of the NHL with two assistants on the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
In both cases, Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was called for the best player of the game, was benefiting from the overview of the 1930-year-old Eishockeystar.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed after the game journalists to have a great evening foretold Giroux.
"Just before the game, I tell him that he's having a hattrick today."
I felt that somehow."
"Once again and again, such a feeling is overcome," explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux already reached a gate at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech trail".
Voráček fought the Puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer reached a short hand, but the second third again belonged to the flyer.
Concrete Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he reached his third meeting, afterwards Wayne Simmonds led his shot to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player in the League, but he certainly belongs to the best three," appreciated Jágr his center.
"I wouldn't have felt that I'm playing with such an Eishockey player, like with him, in the end of my career."
"That's great joy to me."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL, my fellow players put their game on me and now turns around the spice," thrilled Jágr.
Carolina still made the game a drama - through the meetings of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who passed out of a penalty shot, came on a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he had been successful against one in excess of two.
"Awesome pronger was still working in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (read) moved to remoter phospoons."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it has succeeded," Voráček described the last hit of the party from his viewpoint.
Through this victory Philadelphia sat at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defence player of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo and dismissed in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens also bought their leadership in Penalty shoots 2:3.
One of the penalties was unable to transform Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points, the trainer of the home team probably pained the high disease-related failure in the defensive - the game they played only with five defensive players.
"This is bad."
"The encounter we played only with one experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing to do, so we have to get done," said Jacques Martin.
"In each change, one attack wave after the other and we had nothing to do with it."
"We had to make the game easier and get the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defense players.
The Czech Torhüter Ondřej Pavelec rejected thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5:2-victory over Winnipeg.
In the gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different protectors had share.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five authorized state travel offices in then ČSSR: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
The travel offices then sold only travels to the socialist eastern block countries, in the west only elected ones.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the East Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Sotish on the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a prowestal course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed for citizens of the East Block (also the Czechoslovakia) to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travels were not possible.
Even then, the travel offices also offered travel to the west, but then they had to buy huge serpents or also stay in the bed before the travel office, or at least have "good friends" in the travel office.
Even so, it had not been done for a long time.
The so-called devisor - the condition for a journey to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel.
The Czechoslovakia currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to drive the necessary funds (western currency) for a journey into the West.
So most of the Czechs spent their holidays in the countryside, not a wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates - a habit that persists until today.
The contemporary revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While a vacation in the DDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things until 1989, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, which you are no longer aware of today, is the fact that you could not travel to the most popular country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the Yugoslav Republic of then.
Just from the beginning of the 1990s of the past century, the devising obligation was lifted into the neighbouring western European countries, resulting in a huge wave of short visits especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't get enough from their journeys to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
Thus, during traveling to Paris in the tent in the park, the Czech holidayers slept in the park, because who had already had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of foreign trips from Czech was then a full-packed bag room with conserves, beer and permanent worst, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists could finally buy the western currency freely.
Our level of life and then the average wages increased, which started in 1997 in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demands for travel, travel offices began regularly to prepare travels by charter flights after 1997, making flights acceptable thanks to the possibility of negotiating discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already devisible payment traffic with all the highly developed countries of the world, making traveling even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-allocation" travel was found in 2000, when thanks to the high demand of the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights with Czech passengers have been flying every year in far-distance sunny countries; this year they fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another significant moment in the Epoch, which marked our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US lifted the visa obligation for Czech tourists, which definitely ranked our country among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half their vacation abroad (50.3%) for the first time in their history, they spent more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head for a single vacation, including the costs at the vacation site.
The main meeting is to find a new chairman - again threatens a patch.
For almost five months, the Czech football has not been chaired and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not even be known after the extraordinary main meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
Indeed, until today there is no agreement on the electoral system.
And without this, there is no vote on the three potential successors at all.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclik.
In June, Hašek resigned from his function, calling on his colleagues to find a number and a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era to Hašek, the old crossings between the two association chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This appeared rocky and clear on 16 September when the new Chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the Main Assembly had come to the people's house in the Prague Quarter Smíchov, because the negotiation did not result and it was not just about the choice itself.
Indeed, it was not even possible to agree on who is actually voting in the full assembly - only the statutory representatives or also the full-powered officials.
At least partly, the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose representatives were not held on a full-mighted basis, was attached to this only point.
However, the disputes relating to the electoral system continue to persist.
The executive committee also did not have any clarity in the matter, where meetings - whether ordinary or exceptional - are in principle no longer on the agenda.
Although the opinions on the elections changed a few times - the neural point remained the same.
The question is: how should you go in the 3rd round to avoid a Patt situation?
"The issue concerns whether to act in accordance with the Statute or whether to find a completely different model," Dušan Soboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in management.
According to a statutory model, in the third round of the candidate who receives the larger percentage support in the chamber for which he is candidate.
It is supposed to be ready to agree with the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers is victorious.
On the other hand, the Czech side is subject to the condition that the winner receives at least one two-third majority in this percentage vote counting.
"Then the two front rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the entire two chamber concept," Soboda understands the objections of the marital side, which it best would be not to bear the elections, but to choose according to the valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík also agrees, even though it is noted that the statutory electoral order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is that most of the choices will be made in accordance with the Statute."
"In order not to be thought of any unfair replacement variants, as in the last main meeting," explained the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeě, who first candidates and in his opinions was particularly limited to Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
His opinion is that the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the football EM on this day would surely help to calm down the minds."
"When the football runs on the Euphorian wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says Jablonec's functionary, who brings the greatest experience of all three adoptors, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl's back there.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately twofold."
"This is not a matter between the people of the Bohemians and the mauries, but there is some effort to "buy the rules for their own purposes"."
"This is why a relocking is not excluded at the main meeting."
"I hope, however, that the healthy human mind finally wins," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer left.
Some negotiations are supposed to be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be complete until the qualification game at all.
The charter plane, with which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorica, was not able to start in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance, so they sought fevery for a replacement variant as to bring part of the executive committee to the place of the barrage-hinplay.
Lastly, the meeting at Minister level is certainly crucial to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Joseph Dobeš, Minister for Schools, Youth and Body Education, would like to move the split parties within the largest sports union of the country to an agreement.
There is a lot on the game: State applications, the confidence of the Czech football and also the coming main meeting of the ČSTV, which will lead the Czech sport to the new direction after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes into the struggle for the position of the Chairman because he does not see any suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the boss of Pilsner's footballer before the extraordinary main assembly, had been a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new Chairman of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he wouldn't have been able to fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, then I would fight for him and abstain from the choice."
"But in the current situation, there was no way to find such an adepte," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclik to go to Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorites of the choice, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclik also emphasizes that in the event of his victory he intends to exercise the function of the Chairman only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the ordinary main meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would like to see an experienced top manager who is not too much cracked into the football event.
"I personally spoke with some people in question."
"Now to believe that some told me they were not trying to identify themselves with the Czech football at present.
"These views would like to be changed," he pointed out.
Most of all, Paclik believes to disturb Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, which is considered to be a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegated votes on main meetings.
For Paclik it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta was in the position of the Chairman.
"In his victory, today's state would be conservated, and in the Czech football it did not go ahead at all."
"The support of Berbr, a smart businessman, got twice bad on the football," stressed Paclik.
He also argues that Pelta's name some time ago, in conjunction with telephone hearings for the detection of a corruption affaire, but from the Pelta, there was penalty.
"I don't know what Prestige should bring a victory of Pelta to (tsch) football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclik, who said his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club when Pelta president," but sees something more left.
However, if Paclik wins in the Thursday election, he can present himself a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the main meeting in October, ended with a fiasko.
"He (Pelta) was the first I would go to."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters of which I don't understand," said Paclik, who in September took care of it, that he was on the top of the Daymar Damková, after the cancellation of the Vice-President's commission with Luěk Macela.
Paclik himself claims that he feels the role of the Chairman of the Association.
And calls on his capabilities in the management of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the liga with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain stakeholders who tend to influence disciplinary and professional commissions, which is indispensable to situations of disgusting," said Paclik, who does not heal from his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta-Chef Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of the relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with which he would help the political top politicians to lobby that more money flows from lottery tax into sports.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new Chairman should dedicate."
"If it comes to the taxation of gambling, how the political parties declare, then I understand their arguments, but then they also have to clip and say clearly where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club does not also regard Paclík as a disabled person, although he emphasizes himself, the Chairman of the FAČR must be "over-partial".
Pelta is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague Dukla.
"This isn't just ideal."
"It also does not make much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person shinyly to return after another and a half years," said Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would exclude a Patt situation in the future.
Two days before the main meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for the presidency, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised that he would make himself strong in the case of his choice that the FAČR will receive new statutes that will in future exclude disputes on the pre-selection order.
The Jablonec functioner is confident before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes that the election struggle will safely eliminate the possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the unrealised election in September, he wanted to concentrate in the case of his choice on the national team and the acquisition of funds.
He decided only on the last moment to participate in the election before the last main assembly, and so he liked to help the two-month break to defend his ideas about the management of the football and imagine in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to the football, they are impatient and therefore expect the Chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is time for the association to be guided by someone, says the man who is primarily connected with the Jablonecer club, but who also acted many years at Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with elections are the euphoria, which reigned at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Leather was approved at the main meeting in June, statutes that were not as perfect as all had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we had had a chairman since September," said Pelta.
Just reviewing the main document of the Civil Association, he used as a locker for the delegates.
"If I would be chairman, I would accept it personally and will be willing to carry personal responsibility if it fails."
"This is a principal thing without which he cannot be," claims Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to limit himself to his contractors.
He had announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl which he recognises because of his legal education and he knows well that his counter-candidate was his first vice-president.
He has not been attacking Tomáš Paclík for a long time, which, again, did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In the football, he has been moving over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
"But his attacks were diminishing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Therefore, many now doubt about his real character," addressed Pelta his contradictor, who probably remains faithful to his proclaims, which he said in September.
His opinion is that his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lower classes to the national team.
And this should be the shelter of Czech football.
"I would also try to end all the affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the afterhalls of the corruption scandal from last year."
"At the same time, I would fall on negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," said the sixty-four-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football would not mean personal cleansing.
"I should first get to know the content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where the long anarchie makes it understandably nervous.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the coming main assembly, he believes that the delegates are not going to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If we really should be the only controversial point as you choose in the third round, we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility and it only wins back by it if he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the decisive day of his functional career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR starts working hard under him
If the former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl was to be elected as new chairman of the Czech Football Association at the main meeting on Thursday, many people in the Confederation believe that this would avoid the laune.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice you start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual soccer areas.
In addition, he promised to solve the case of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into the football and otherwise continue the work that the previous Chairman Ivan Hašek began.
"As Chairman I want to devote myself to the football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, through national selection, professional football, to the performance football for youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore I want to distribute the competences of the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I'm going to distribute hard tasks so that the football gets forward in every segment with miles."
Many would not just be pleased about this because, instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would have to begin to work very hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it has been considered not to apply anymore.
"I know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I have to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me who don't throw me uneasy knobs between my legs and question any step I'm doing," he said as an explanation why he was awaiting.
"But many people told me that I couldn't give up because otherwise others would do."
"This is trust that you can't play," he said.
It also seems that he is motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years, we have handled a big piece of work and I don't just want to throw that away."
"Processes were started, which may only come into force in a few years and I would only be disadvantaged to see that they stop someone," he said and thus expressed his concern that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be chosen, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that is something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"It's especially people who would make the football so that he'd only be there for elected ones."
I think you can imagine some things, but not that I would be partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone's going well and not just the chosen one," Rajchl noted.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a Chairman of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really want to do the best possible for mauries."
"For example, it is time to consider whether you should not divide the League into a Czech and a maritime part, whose winners then went up to the first league each."
"Then it could not happen that today only three maritime clubs play in the liga, which is especially a problem for the young players in mahren," says Rajchl.
Since the chief of Pilsner Clubs Tomáš Paclík has joined the struggle for the function of the Chairman, Rajchl is not sure to estimate his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, who elected me to its vice-president and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl, who also views the saving of twenty million crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association is not taking on a single strike.
While he says of Pelta, "he is disqualified from above to help the Czech football to retrust," he considers the second rival - Paclík a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in only one year."
"If he was to be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the staff occupation in the Commission would not change in principle."
He would surely not want to turn things into his favor," Rajchl judges his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into blue
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo-Optik, Prunkpools in Budapest: Who travels through Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike rest the tired legs in spray baths.
A book shows where wellness is the most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip in the last half of the years, one could not miss in her baggage: her bathroom suit.
Backling on the water, she looked high in artificially designed couples, they swept against marble pants waiting for them at the edge of the basin, and astonished of acrybiously restored youth style swimming pools.
If she found a bathroom, she included it in her notebook - as well as knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her just appeared book "Badejoy": Volksschimmhallen in Munich, historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she took her "road to the most outstanding baths in Central Europe": Besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and each city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiastic.
With sport, she doesn't have much on her hat, says Meder - only in the water it's different.
Annoyingly, swimming fans have to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine tanks, while jogger can breathe the devastating fragrance of fig forests or listen to jolly bird twitters in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools must always be so horrible," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"I started to gather beautiful baths."
Water surface double architecture
Platforms in the jumping pool and etheric sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are used, so Meder.
And when the builders have given themselves effort, swimming halls can be a true eye mud: "Stilling a floor you have a water surface in baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles optical: high wools, coloured tiles, jumping boards.
On 190 pages, the small-format video band "Bade joy" provides knowledge about the architecture and culture history of historical wellness oases - but, above all, it wants to jump into the blue.
Remarkable copies discovered the pool collector Meder in her research in Hungary.
Besides beautiful cure baths such as the 100-year Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest, she found a nitrate water in a urgency cart cave (hole bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose pool is filled with alkali-containing water and is located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, spectacular views offer many heated free baths in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the entire city in the eye of the Zürich roof bath, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outer pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the drive on the ski ski.
The most extraordinary swimming pool design expects bath guests in long-term field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO landed just in the Alps.
From three upward open shells it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal are raging into the sky.
Alhambra in Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder got the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell to sulphur, in the Árpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so strongly for heating oil that you hardly believe to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water that is almost black and its sickness sticks to the skin as soon as you can glide into the basin - a wellness experience of the special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathrooms: when she wanted to visit the free and sunbad in the Czech bathroom Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrain.
The bath, designed in 1902 by the architect Dušan Jurkovic, was now closed.
When Meders threw a look through the sharpened windows of the red-white-yellow youth style building, she saw unclean between the tiles growing.
On the other hand, it has been counteracted in a magnificent swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already been behind this bathroom; not only neoromanic elements can be discovered from the times of its construction in 1844, but also a maurical hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of Iris Meder - and not just because it originates from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance to merge so different construction styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, the diving walk in the thermal pool seems to be only an adjacent case.
Agriculture speculation
Deutsche Bank allows raw material business to be illuminated
By Christian Teevs
Does the German Bank give up its business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has assigned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the group wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of the Germans do not find it acceptable, according to a study, that banks speculating with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of the respondents demand that the German Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it worsens the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Consumer Organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global raw stock exchanges are pushing prices up to the height - and the banks therefore have a co-debtedness on the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protectors is directed against the German-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw material laws were intended to ensure traders against price fluctuations.
However, most experts agree that the zockers have disconnected themselves from supply and demand - and make profit at the cost of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to criticism: He promised to examine the claims and said that no business was " worth playing the good reputation of the German Bank".
According to information provided by SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently exploring the claims from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the results will be presented to the Governing Board of the German Bank and recommendations on how to handle it.
At the end of January, the bank's top will then tell what consequences it draws.
At the end, a reduction in the raw material business could be, or even the complete return.
Ackermann bastards on his image
Foodwatch-Chef Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time confirmed his criticism for the financial sector: "The bets at rising prices of food show particularly drastically how unreasonable banks today harm the general thing."
Ackermann is now the chief bank lobbyist in particular.
"The German Bank has to remove all plants from its portfolio where money for bets is spent on food prices," said Bode.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is about people suffering from hunger or the German Bank's reputation."
The insight of Ackermann comes surprising at the first glance, but it is clear that the Group's wish to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the German Bank announced that the Head of Management will not change to the Supervisory Board, differently than planned.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural population, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible penalties, he hardly needs to shake himself - that would eventually have to do his follower.
Each second would cancel raw materials plant
Foodwatch strives to keep pressure on the manager.
More than 30 000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa asked 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
It is therefore just 11 per cent that the German Bank offers plants for food prices.
Many banking customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such businesses: each second would cancel the survey accordingly all installations where money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would decline acquaintance from such a bank, 49 percent indicated to think about cancelling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Wien
The Pavilion Moved
Vienna
An architectural history with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 awarded prices, was a museum in Vienna, stood empty and sold.
Now he will be reopened as an exhibition house.
When modern after-war architecture is heated, by clear forms, glass halls, courageous wings and new buildings that are typical for the faith in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is a fine and famous example for the Bressler World Exhibition in 1958.
The Grand Prix d'Architecture was then awarded for its lightweight and floating steel glass construction.
Contemporary architecture is considered to be a milestone to this day.
He announced the architects so that it was also built at the next World Exhibition of Austria's Pavillon.
With his legendary BMW-Vier-Cylinderhaus plus scooter-large biconstruction in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, was set up, rebuilt, and opened in 1962 a museum of the 20th century - the "20th house" was called.
However, the building was not suitable spatial and technically as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used so long until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the pavilion, he now is called "21's house" and is used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, in which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition - a happiness in every way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has been re-started.
Husslein-Arco, promovated artistic historian with a considerable career, including in the youth as ice-art runner, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, made the reconstruction vigorously of politicians and monumental guardians, acquired public funds and private sponsor funds and established the use.
Besides present art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the same named foundation, there should be a café and a book store, and a office house had to be built.
Strict supervision, small etat
For the implementation, then Crisianitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had reconstructed and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna sensitively and gained competition, but because he studied at the Finnish Technical University of Vienna and was the pavilion for him a "unfortunately important place" where he had viewed the exhibitions "about every weekend".
He knew the Ur draft, and he knew the problems of the building that was lost when he moved to Vienna and his reuse to generosity and lightness.
There were much bigger problems during the current conversion: the building was "a energy sludge," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fibers have been exchanged, glass faserver-powered isolation glass used and the glass roof has been replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel carriers have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos filled covers have been cleaned.
Two undershots brought space for the new use, a lowered light grave between house and street provides for the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light pitch pavilion.
The original outdoor doors have remained, the house is deleted in the old red brown rust protection color.
And the cinema hall is even quite the same as it was before.
And all of this under the strict supervision of the monumental authority and with a little etat.
"Oftly, a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the monumental protection office," says Krissanitz and pointes to a ripped soil in the underground.
Despite all forces, problems and restructuring, the building is flexible and easy remaining.
It would have been difficult with the Pavillon, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "Drop-in-the-City story".
Such an architecture stands "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real consciousness".
In this case, the 21st house is not at the wrong place, because it has occurred a city-building happiness: around the Swiss garden is just the completely newly planned "Main Station", with office and living houses.
And another happiness may occur: The 21st house could be reinforced by another Krischanitz-Bau, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and as you hear, she is already negotiating with the city about a neighbourhood location in the Swiss garden.
Train Plant Winter Crises Package in Million Heights
The train has developed a crisis plan to prevent train losses in winter.
The number of employees will be doubled.
That cost millions.
In the fight against winter-related train losses and delays, the German Railway is also going to publish more than EUR 70 million this year in a newspaper report.
The "Picture" newspaper reported in advance on a group-internal crisis plan that, by 2015, investments of around EUR 300 million were planned.
This aimed at improving the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather.
It is planned, among other things, to double the internal and external employees for snow removal on railways and to rise to 16,000 persons.
The aim is to free railways from snow and ice within four to five hours until the start of operation and 90 percent of the operating softnesses.
Two months ago, the train-Chef Rüdiger Grube had warned, after a top meeting with government and industry, against train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, the railways had considerable problems in passenger transport, as they lacked reserves, inter alia, under difficult weather conditions.
Thus many new regional trains have been waiting for an authorisation from the railway alliance for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE moves.
The train has also been creating for years that it has to make ICE train axes more frequently checked in the workshop after an ICE had a axis break in the Cologne main station.
Deutsche Bank pays million punishments in the United States
After the tumult around Chief Josef Ackermann comes a new disaster from the United States: The German Bank has to pay a million fine there.
As if the problems at home weren't enough for the German Bank, the industry rice is now getting its past in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a comparison to settle disputes due to the Pleite of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes a whole series of large banks that have misleaded the cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; they would have declined the risks.
Such papers are lost during the financial crisis and the banks are deep.
"We are satisfied that we were able to solve the subject without the parties having to move before court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The Bank did not blame for the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to the payment of $20,5 million.
The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the reconciliation of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US Association Banks and jumps in to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the damage caused by billions of severe damage.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their type.
The regulator had also bought up other large banks and in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The hypothesis documents in question are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
These are home credits.
When the U.S. immobile blossom was placed in 2007, this became an obstacle to a variety of financial companies.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers turned around.
Although the events have been back for a few years, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have endeavored a number of complaints to obtain remuneration or to avoid breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest complaint.
It introduces 18 international large banks to have overprivocated the two US-Immobile-financing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in hypothesis transactions in the volume of around $200 billion.
The German Bank must also complain about the FHFA, here are several businesses worth a total of $14.2 billion from the years 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires the Frankfurter to be equal to "substantial losses", but not to mention a precise sum.
The German Bank had rejected the claims as non-compliant and declared to want to fight.
Warren Buffett rises by 10 billion at IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests strongly in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the large American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of companies is only badly predicting.
But now he read the business reports of IBM and changed his view of investment in the industry.
He has already had to understand much earlier that IBM offers services and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered to be a rider in the financial world.
As a result, the IT urgestein IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett has now revealed in the US Economy Sender CNBC that he has bought $10.7 billion since March IBM shares.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM by a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM has not known anything about the commitment.
He praised the management that, even in the economic crisis, still provided for ordinary gains.
"You made a great job," said Buffett about the strategy.
IBM has been putting on the lucrative IT services, such as the operation of data centres.
The computer pioneer, more than 100 years old, also offers software and advice as well as powerful corporate calculators.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until then.
He says he's only investing in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett was in touch with a cargo train, with a lubricant manufacturer or machine manufacturer.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a whole series of large companies, such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and developed it with wise investment into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost incredible sense of money has brought him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
According to the fact that the Buffett investment was known, the IBM share increased by a percentage.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also mentioned, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is counting together with Apple and Microsoft as the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, but he didn't want to get in.
Bill Gates founder is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Twickauer Cell" Turkish media are doubting the German legal state.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which is now resurrecting.
The murders of eight Turkish tribes and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a legal extreme background.
This message is reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
Because for many German towers, there is a long-removable spirit: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-extreme background against Turks.
The fact that there is foreign hostility in Germany was never in question.
However, the evident right-extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is not yet to be seen.
"Relives the bloody ideology?" titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Habberturk".
On the other hand, the "Sabah" newspaper stresses that one of the actors should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and shows concern that also German authorities could be involved in the legal sump.
Besonnen reacted to the Turkish municipality of Germany: in the weekend, she remembered the victims of racist violence with a Mahnwache before the Brandenburg Gateway.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought in a feast of the fiftyth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In joyful colors, the interaction had been focused - as a story of success.
As a earfee, the reporting of some Turkish media: "Gift of Fifty Germany" is the heading of an article in the Turkish Internet Platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" is also unable to take this thoughtful link.
"It begins to stink," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He emphasizes that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
In German-Turkish Internet Forums, it is extremely critical to discuss the action of the police and their later findings of flags.
The authors are wondering why it was not much more for the German authorities to search for suspiciouss in legal extreme circles.
Some are at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: "If they continue to be swallowed here, the immigrants remain nothing but self-defense and arms."
"That'll be the best self-protection."
"From the goodness of the information and suitability of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Seels".
What it means if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have been illustrated.
The photo of the firelines of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turkish living here more clearly that there is a fatigue threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can be held in right violence.
The attacks, however, intensified the We-Feel on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, the failure of German politics was then defected after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit Mölln's survivors.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a complaint to the Turkish Presidents, but he was represented at the sad feast in Cologne by his Minister for Foreign Affairs, Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then listed in his speech how many fees the Turks made.
Just like, the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of its tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media once again shows the depth of the mistrust of many German towers in the current state of law since now.
In addition to the efforts of extensive information and re-evaluation of legal extreme terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The Scandal Bank of Zurisee
The most adventureous bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankruptcy in the financial crisis and has been loosening from a crisis to the next.
Now a German is going to judge it.
That's how Axel Weber wouldn't have thought.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Federal Bank, he was announced in July that he would take up a nearly as spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Switzerland Grand Bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praised Switzerland of its beauty and the UBS of its newly gained solidarity and made friendly comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS made the turnaround."
"I look forward to cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gräbel."
But already in September, it became clear that everything would come quite different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had surrounded all the bank’s security systems and sucks around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS Chairman Oswald Grübel, a not only famous banker in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the President-in-Office of the UBS has also been regarded as attacked - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber eventually come?
It has already been known that Weber may advise the bank from February 2012.
And he is already taking over the Board of Directors in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes hard.
He is not a banker, rather an economic professor and a note banker and would certainly have needed a time of integration.
With a hit, he takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank which has just proved that it has long earned the title "the largest scandal bank of Europe".
Because the UBS, on the one hand, is huge - until recently it was the world's largest asset manager - and on the other hand, it has slept from a scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, the once so proud Swiss bank remains spared.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The picture of the silent and solid, but also buffed Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in the investment banking.
The UBS managed in 2007, on the one hand, with $1.6 billion more money from assets of customers than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she was a investment bank in the liga of the largest banks in the world.
That impressed.
The only banker and later long-term bank professor in Zürich Hans Geiger tells us: "My students I always made the UBS as a pattern of a good bank at that time."
"From today's point of view, you're wondering, how could I just mislead myself?"
He was really wrong.
The first time in 2007, it became apparent that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Head of Management Peter Wuffli came back surprisingly, who was considered a highly intellectual and also brilliant banker.
A few months later, they realized why he had gone.
The bank's investment firms had licked up with subprime papers and had to describe billions.
In order to train this, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of sage and writes 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, however, who would have been rubbed by some until recently: a transparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund that was so silent that it was not even known to be his name.
But that was only the first struggle.
It was worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, President-in-Office of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, in 2006 the secondly paid board of Switzerland, returned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe followed: The UBS was incurred by its failure to invest in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the State.
The National Bank bought the UBS for twenty billion problematic securities, the Swiss EEC gave six billion francs for a compulsory change loan, which it could become a co-owner of the Bank.
The whole Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it houses so large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the size of the Switzerland's economic performance (see Graphics).
"Now we couldn't save the UBS," says bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster joined the second.
For a few months thereafter, the UBS captured in the tax dispute with America and declared ready to publish the data of customers who might have deducted taxes by means of the Bank.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million as a repayment of unjustified profits from these businesses as well as penalties.
Thus, the UBS knew more or less openly to have helped with the deduction of taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has ever been her capital in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of diversity.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the withdrawal of the Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the Exodus of Customer Money.
In a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in the investment banking through misspeculations and asset management by helping to deduct taxes.
And just when it became a little more calm, just as you thought, now the UBS will get it again, then this inevitable dealer story follows: a single dealer licks EUR 1.7 billion before the bank notices that something is wrong.
And it becomes obvious: Risk management in investment banking still does not work.
"In the case of Adoboli, you have to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economy and Financial Professor at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it is not able to handle risk control."
It had been exactly the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had been engaged long ago to become guardians of the world's great assets: no too high risks, security for money, could collapse the world even over the Alps Republic.
The Tresore of the Swiss Banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The central of the UBS in Zurich is still suitable for the clinic of the dedicated Swiss private bank - it is just a little bigger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank has its headquarters at the Züricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads from the main station directly to the Zürich Sea, which is embraced by the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the shop rentals belong to the highest in Europe.
Jewelry like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditions such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks have lived here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is entered through a heavy turn door.
Inside, the walls are marbled, in front of it a thick leather seat, next to the bank logo, a large sign of "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and credit Suisse, but at some point disappeared - or betrayed as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not like to read his name in the newspaper, and finally, like all Swiss bankers, he also makes business with the two large banks.
The UBS had become too large, he finds it - especially in the investment banking, where the angel axis had also spread.
The Swiss had nothing to say there.
"And if so, they have long adapted to the seeds of the angel axis."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Sax Investment Banking that changed the UBS, first made its high profits and then the Debakel: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss large bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
"On Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the greatest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros authorized politicians to rescue the bankrupt.
How could it come to it?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too large in the merger for the small Switzerland - and growing ever further.
This helped the two different preliminary banks of the UBS complement: a rich but sleepy bank with the focus of property management in Zurich and a poorer but more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks came in favour of a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Concern of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Administrative Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellektual, modest, understanding a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the stomach man who worked up from the banking to the top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end, "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, courage came before the case.
Employees of the UBS recall clearly the leadership meetings on which Conzernchef Wuffli repeatedly released the same parole: Goldman Sachs shot from the throne.
The American Bank was the world's most powerful investment bank.
She directed the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
The UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps had already been lucky.
She played upstairs in the transaction and in the stock trade.
However, business consultants, who were assigned, raised a weakness: in the international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there was a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps with American hypothesis products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that she cost almost the existence.
Hunger after growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime plants.
It developed into a huge machine that packed securities on American hypothesis credits and continued to reach - but also maintained risks itself.
Even when other banks were long looking for the exit.
"Now in summer 2007, when the American real estate market stood in flames, the UBS bought there," says bank expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep.
One manager after the other had to go when the trials cleared out more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS have become the seat and are wakeful until today.
Whoever leads the big bank now has a nearly impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has overcome all the business models nearby.
Bank researcher Geiger has already an idea: Final with investment banking, concentration to the assets management, return to the Swiss roots.
The Bank does not want to go (now) to that far.
But the investment banking is to be strongly reduced, so much is already clear.
The next Thursday, the new bank manager Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to present its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually only thought to be a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from predecessors.
In the meantime, he has been able to carry out the businesses of the UBS permanently, the Zürich Bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to drive back the Investment Bank at the middle of the nineties.
3500 places he struggles.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to earn money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask now.
Openly he just says he's going to search for a apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe burdens US Exchanges
The threatening recession in Europe has couraged the US investors for the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without battle force.
The threatened industrial production on the continent plunged the hopes for a stabilisation of the debt crisis in the world.
The general facilitation of the change of government in Rome and Athens could not take place.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass remained half full in the last week, not half empty - but now, the problems were raised again, said Mark Luschini by Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow-Jones index of the standard values recorded at a minus by 0.6 per cent at 12.078 points.
In the course of trade, the market barometer penetrated between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The broader fixed S&P-500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of a percent.
The index of the Nasdaq technology exchange lost 0.8 per cent and went out of trade with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax accepted with a negative of 1.2 percent at 5985 counters.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is confronted with the end of the recovery.
In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as the Eurostat Statistical Office announced.
The US investors were skeptical: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free from a recession as soon as possible, and there will be further signs of weaknesses in the banks.
The investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
Therefore, from his viewpoint it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade of old principle on the masses and entered the US technology industry.
His investment over $10 billion in IBM supported the stock price of the traditional group and let him first note a percentage higher against the trend in trade.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187,35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece according to its own data and now holds 5.5 per cent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
The Bank of America’s shares were significantly stronger than the market by 2.6 percent.
The house silvers almost the whole of its shares in the China Construction Bank and invokes $6,6 billion for this.
The Institute wants to meet its capital rates and, above all, harder regulatory requirements with the net gain from the business.
The aircraft builder Boeing added and thus limited the losses in the dow.
The share won 1.5 percent after the group had collected the largest order of his history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 longitudinal machines of type 777 on Sunday and numbered the value of the order to $18 billion.
Included from options to 20 other machines, the volume even amounts to $26 billion.
On the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million shares changed the owner.
719 values were added, 2281 surrendered and 79 remained unchanged.
In turns of 1,38 billion shares, 630 in plus, 1913 in minus and 82 were unchanged at Nasdaq.
Intelligent cranes spread in cities
Seed cranes are considered to be "problem birds": but from the cities the high-intelligent animals are no longer displaced, claimed experts.
The one likes them, the others want to get rid of them very quickly: Crowns have been part of the city picture for centuries, but in many municipalities, the inhabitants are incurring troubles about devastating and noise of the animals.
In this regard, a means against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed cranes are no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crown symposium in the East-Freshish Empire.
There specialists from the entire federal territory were advised about possible explanations.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Natural protectors also led the problems in cities to the aerodrome of the particularly protected seeds: the chemistry effort in agriculture has increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing cultivation and the cases of typical broken trees made the birds difficult to live.
Crowns are under nature protection.
Large colonies with more than 600 broken pairs are found in the western Falish Soest, in the northwest, among other things in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in empty.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crowns in the district had provided negative lines.
Critics had called the catching of the animals in birdfalls and the killing with knobs as particularly brutal.
"The normal dislocation, which grunts, brings nothing," said the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from empty.
Nearly spraying with water or falling trees, often have undesirable consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Emperor from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are soft, large colonies are split up and distributed in other places."
Irritation is only possible as an exception to hospitals, homes of age or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them away anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem in the cities is not solved, Mayor Wolfgang Kellner said it was empty.
It is possible to think of a combination of wrestling the animals from sensitive residential areas and locks to resettle them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologists and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, "instead of chain sowings, were thrown for a whole other dealing with the animals: "A peckel in the face we can finally be able to endure the best self-conscious."
Jürgens had founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad, where a sign informs about the life of the high-intelligent seed creatures.
The project has already been adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on criticism of the noise of birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed cranes use not only tools to get to a leaker bitch, but as a tool, they even produce their tools themselves.
Behavior researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested four seed cranes, how far the intelligence of birds is.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring a noise into the crash with stones to get to a moth larve.
Without much training, they targeted the size and shape of a stone to have the platform collapsed.
In a second attempt, the pleasant cranes had to solve a more tough problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small emmer with a motten larve.
With the snavel, the birds were unable to reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid them wirepieces.
Of this, all four animals formed a crochet, with the help of which they then threw the crush on the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seed cranes even achieved this.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks on a coup remained out.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are present at the EM 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-offs.
Following the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th) Portugal hit Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM participation in a row after the 0:0.
The Czechs reached 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off game at the outside of Montenegro after the Hinspiel (2:0) had been a clear thing.
No more burning made Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland brought a more relaxed 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) reached the further meetings for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga-Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-rote map (54.).
Bosnia had already failed to Portugal in the Play-offs to the WM 2010 in South Africa.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal took a start by measure.
Ronaldo hunted an unload of about 30 meters for early lead in the masks.
A good quarter hour later, Nani showed his wide-shot quality and hit from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half of the hour, had their first clear chance by Torjäger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the British table leader Manchester City put a headball at the bottom of the latte, but the ball did not cross the gateline (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, arbitrary judge Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was in the centre.
After an attack against Hero Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided to swallow and showed the Portuguese the yellow map (36.).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade meter after an action by Fabio Coentrao, the Misimovic safely transformed.
But after the break, the Vice-European Champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81th minute.
Thus, the European Champion of 1976 is going to the EM for the fifth time.
However, the team of Trainer Michal Bilek with the Federal Legionary Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1 FC Nürnberg) also had happiness and had to survive a horror in the beginning phase.
The final man Petr Cech prevented a possible owner by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had its greatest possibilities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turning from the border of the penalty just near the gate of Cech.
After the break, the crosslet had to save for the already hit world class gateway of the Czechs, again the storm of the FC Seoul had deducted (50.).
The gate finally made everything clear shortly before the end.
Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not come beyond a 0:0.
While National Trainer Guus Hiddink thus has to make its place safely on the WM third bank of 2002, the Croatians may rejoice over their fourth participation in an EM ending.
Before 31,000 viewers in the Maxsimir Stadium, the Turks had almost seen a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met in the seventh minute with a distance shot only the Pfosten, attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't sink the rebellor in the gate.
After the horror, however, Croatia took over more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians were not allowed to burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from the VfL Wolfsburg, which took place for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62th minute, the Federal Leagues Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Industry Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni travels to EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of Trainer Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a pre-decision in the 32th minute with the 4:0 success in the Hinspiel.
Constantine Vassiljev (57.) matched for the guests.
Ireland pressed up speed from the beginning, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only in the last moment, the Estonian back team prevented the possible leadership.
But in the 32th minute it was done.
After a disadvantaged defense by the final man Pavel Londak, Ward was at place and pushed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of employees in the country.
By 2015, about two billion dollars (approximately 1.5 billion euros) were reported by the Dax Group on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and set up then employees," announced the Co-Chef Bill McDermott on a customer fair in Beijing.
The employees are currently going to grow from about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for company software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world's more than 176 000 SAP customers are sitting in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the 2015 strategy of the Dax Group.

"Now we want to expand our activities (...)", explained McDermott.
"Our objective is to promote sustainable growth in China, based on comprehensive information."
Mass slaughter at a personal level
The new book "Beauty and Fear. A story of the First World War, tells in nineteen destiny halls", Peter Englund begins with a long list of main people who are going to heart.
Here is a hint about how to do: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will know these people very well in Englund's romantic story, and these main people will function as your GPS, as a light tower in these few moments, where you are lost like Englund's men and women in the fog of war and robbed your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he does not describe inappropriately as "a work of anti-story".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battle. There are hardly ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions on tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unattended men and women on both sides of the war, from school girls and botanists to mountain climbs, doctors, nurses and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some get to war prisoners, lose members, become crazy or die.
Each of these lives looks like the Votivkers in a church, some come to, while others erase.
The book deviates from the usual historical books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War had only been the devastating position war at the Westfront.
"Beauty and horrors" wandering with expert views of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall bye baskets, a celebration of Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsets flying is an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moving book.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, who smells to Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children and hear the cannon fire in the distance. Stay or take the escape?
Who's coming at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happens or why this war is at all being carried out.
"Failing facts," says Englund, "was furnished with suspects, assumptions, hopes, anxiety, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, a English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stomp, a young German shipmater.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other materials already published.
Their life reports may be terrible or fascinating, but they are extremely alive in Englunds of the small moments that lose in detail.
Many of them deal with lack and help.
In the history of a German school girl, he says, "Replace, everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, false radier rubber, paper associations, wood buttons."
He tells more about replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "Flesh made of pressed rice and baked in hammel fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes covered with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food replacements allowed in the manufacture of worsts, 511 registered coffee replacements."
Some stories deal with honor and courage.
A American recognises his own desire to wildness and says about the war: "You feel that in spite of everything that was more intended for men than to sit in the lone chair, with the evening sheet or the best seller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to do that than meant such a fassade civilization and as if there were no barbary behind your own strengthened and complained shirt."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and will not take note of it or take care of it.
"If you take a distance from the thought of offering yourself, you want to think this happens before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are related to the old Europe that is divorced and about new types of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly a economic competition," says Englund, "a war between factories."
He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the constituent of the still young century": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a measure that slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People act in an unforeseen manner and there is just as freely behavior as heroism.
Indeed, the soldiers who actively tried to inflict a prostitute with a sex disease to escape the front service.
"The large-scale expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonoke eatres, because soldiers bought and smuggled on their genitals in the hope to come to the hospital," he writes.
"They who were really desperate kicked him into the eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes shy and yet unreasonable and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he starts the way the war "refused uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to wonder why their leaders will bring them to battle.
The best books about the First World War were usually more falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romans like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" than extensive historical books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional roaming hall.
His book has the most devastating end of which I have ever read in a textbook.
I don't give it anymore.
But it's as if he had snatched us with his book this page with the main persons in front of the nose and ignited us with a timber.
After a early failure, a minute planned override
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them were wearing helmets.
One had decided for the night from Monday on Tuesday, because at this time there are hardly people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. All others believed first to participate in a exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underlined the fact that the surgery was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past weeks such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the Desrnat and the householders made a huge increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officers had prepared them by watching how occupations were managed in other cities.
A catastrophe exercise had taken place with a view to Zuccotti on Randall Island.
Officials strengthened the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - to concentrate on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit took place on the Manhattan page of the East River.
The order to get into the park came "in the last minute," said someone who is familiar with the commands, which was spoken of a declaration as "training".
"The few policemen involved in my knowledge didn't know that it was about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-level officials of the resort."
One reason for confidentiality was a lesson that the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then returned when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned about these plans.
Officers of various police units were involved in the Tuesday surgery, including operating commands from the whole city - hundreds of mobile officials, usually used in high crime neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that during the day, many people enter and go out into the park, almost like pendlers, so that 1 hour in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this if the smallest number of people stayed in the park," he said.
Rescue cars with jupiter lamps and speakers were ready before departure at the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-signed news that thrust from the speakers seemed to shock many protesters.
When the public officials ended in their bright blue wind jackets in the park, many protesters simply picked up their stuff and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 no tents would be handled to give the protester time to pack their possessions and good together.
Other teams of officials were seen how they gathered in the area to intervene, arrests in the park should be required.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, speaker of the police president, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police action in the park, and they said the dealing with the officials had been very cruel.
Mr Browne said that television cars in the Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved to the west through the great interference with the personal things of the protesters, including bags, art breeds and bags with clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, which lifted up what had been left.
Some protesters who refused to go were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park position.
Some created barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
Approximately 10 people in the epicenter of the camp joined their arms.
And two people chased themselves on trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Officers of disaster protection were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until about 3:30 p.m.
According to the police, the space was completed after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests were found, as he said, because of "inappropriate behavior and resistance to a arrest".
The most prominent official on site was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformized official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of Department of Criminal Officers, was there too.
Despite his presence, Mr Kelly "not the surgery", as Mr Browne said.
If they were to access, a second group of officials waited on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were built.
It was observed how these locations from the police expanded the circumstance around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officials, many of them with protective signs, were observed to drive people out.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern circuits.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
By 5 p.m., a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air from the tyre of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of lockwood.
At the end, a official and a protester came to the hospital.
Maintainer's trade union will complain against the city for dismissal
The trade union, who represents hundreds of school maintainers who have lost their job last month, plans to complain about the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals due to their inadequate influence on the schools that teach poor students are not necessarily and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last way that the trade union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to undo the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy school helpers, care coordinators and other employees who were among the worst paid employees of the city and lost their work on 7 October in a chess train, described the trade union leader as a political vengeance for the refusal of access to a health fund undertaken by the working groups to close the budget gaps last year of the city.
This accusation was declined by the authorities.
At a hearing from the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, last month, the dismissals were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that in the budget nothing specifies that the staff of the school aid would be released.
Officers of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the complaint will be announced formally before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The complaint will bring Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as accused and will count eight dismissed workers as a complainant, who are all colored or Latin American women, like most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman of the Ministry of Justice of the City, said that the city is not in charge of the complaint, so its individual claims could not be commented.
According to a draft complaint before the New York Times, the trade union has concentrated on the number of dismissals at schools in the poor districts of the city to support a complaint for inequality treatment. It claims that poor schools had lost more helpers as they were chronicly underfined.
It states that while there were no dismissals in State Island and few dismissals in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school helpers in the 23st district in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 helpers were released in the districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five out of eight school helpers who were employed at the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of occupied parents who can organize donations to capture budget cuts."
P.S.: The 36th District budget was reduced by 3.26 per cent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its method of extra-financing for each arms school registration.
The trade union also complains that the heads of the high schools were led by the language in a memo into the wrongs, which approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: transfer) in the United States usually describes the exchange of a teacher from the paylist of a school to a pool of workers available to be paid by the central office.
"Sixty-sixteen coordinators of care were released, not transferred," says the draft complaint.
Mission Finished, Congress ready to agree on Libya
Finally, it seems as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington were already to agree on the rebellions in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolts, the arrest and murder of the long-term dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's Committee on International Relations decides a resolution under the Chairman of John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libyen for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "mother".
"This resolution honours the courageous people of Libyen who started to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but nothing has been simply in the Libyan debate.
This summer the lawyers of both parties and the White House argued about the vocabulary of a number of resolutions to approve or disappoint the role of the US military in the Libyan NATO mission.
In June Kerry and McCain presented a resolution which approved the restricted use of the US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide margin group of both parties and there was no vote.
However, on the same day this law passed through in the Senate. In addition, the Chamber exceeded a decision to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
Thus, the U.S. mission came into a kind of legislative fire - with a congress that was excited enough to criticize Obama's approach in the context of the mission, but not in anger enough to draw him definitively under the feet.
Then the unconsciousness of the congress was overcome by the events.
Tripolis fell under the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20th.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their huge courage and outstanding endurance in their self-release" and "plys the men and women of the U.S. military military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also confirms "the national interests of the United States on a successful and irreversible transition of Libya to democracy".
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board or will they split the legislators as the June Act did?
The last version is based on the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republic of the Committee.
On Monday, Lugar's speaker said that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Kapitol, it is at the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congress-legislator period of the Republicans and some democrats.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change to the budget or to another area that is currently going to be voted in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have hitherto tried without success to bring their amendments to vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlatte's change is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been submitted to this Congress and include a whole bandwidth of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented both to the Congress and to the Senate - others are only slightly different from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the countervailing budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - especially beginners of the Republicans who want to polate their lifetime - the opportunity to praise that they have "which action is written".
The budgetary control law adopted in August requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budgetary compensation.
In March 58 Senators voted for a non-binding resolution which supports the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some Members want to limit the number of provisions that members of the Congress may submit, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of office of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that forbids a marriage under equal sex is just as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring presentation.
Some legislators also want to allow the suspension of federal laws when two-thirds of the states reject them.
As zealous as Members suggest changes, they move even faster than in the past years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislator presented 77 such changes in 110th Congress 66.
The rate is blurred compared to that of the early 1990s, where members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures available by the Senats Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27. - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Found but not defeated", says Giffords in the first TV interview after the attack
Ten months after a armed man had shot on her from the nearest distance during a election event in Tucson, the Republicanist Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on Monday evening in the national television. She sang alone to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover is greater than that to return to the convention.
When she appeared "20/20" together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC messages, she ran by words and needed help in walking.
The consignment showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the bullet, which divided its skull, borrowed the left side of its brain and crossed its head from front to back.
Three months ago, she returned surprisingly to the Congress to triumphate her voice to the debt brake.
In her first TV interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described her healing as "sufficient".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41): "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a unique "20/20" specialist, which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gabby: A story about courage and hope."
The Special follows Gifford's healing since the attentive of 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, they are seen in the hospital bed, with cold racing head and a long shell over the forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nick with your head.
A suck with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's healing: You see the congress members singing together with the therapists of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily with treatment, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12th, Giffords had read an article of a daily newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the first time for the six people who had been killed during the attack.
Jared Lee Loughner, the contemptful shooter, is in a prison in Missouri and is forced to be treated medically while waiting for his negotiation.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Heart, hard, hard."
During the healing of his wife, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you weren't defeated?" said Kelly.
You just got hit.
And you will endure this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Truppens feel more compassionate than Respect
The event was a Wall Street Galla that collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On one keyword, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The amount in black smokings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation in spring.
A senior military officer on the Gala, which was observed among other things by the Stabchef and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like being kids," wrote the officer in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, really not.
The violent contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims.
But the praise has his prize, says servants.
The public behaves increasingly as if you do people in uniform suffering.
"We were no victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who ordered troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way of support is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear unthankful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that the returning troops in the last years of Vietnam war had been much worse.
As a result, talks about compassion in silence and privately between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from battle with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a feeling of awefulness, as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a "angry, violent veteran is hidden under the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over a raised state post in Washington after his return.
During his work search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtlely asked whether he was able to stand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return.
"If you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," explained Cancian his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of Americans' interest in war.
Services on the battlefield are taken out by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only rarely as praise.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was quite usual in the Second World War," said Luitenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses mostly on the suffering of a servant.
Truppen find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the seriousness of their injuries.
Military is faced with the growing pressure on rape.
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are charged for non-interference in the event of a rape before the military court.
If this is not the case, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
Upper-free Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped by a soldier colleague in the night.
It was in October 2008 and she was just returning to her chains in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague who had a 12 pack of beer with her.
He asked her if he should accompany her for a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texanian wiped her concerns by side.
I thought, "Ah what, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my abdominal feeling."
Just a few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stood behind her, pressed her down and assaulted her, she claimed.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other present and former military officers are afraid of a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which they decide whether a complaint which they have brought before court against the former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not committed against the widespread rape within the military and under infringement of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., submitted the complaint at the beginning, included 17 complainants, but increased to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who allegedly claimed that they were raped or sexually abused by soldier colleagues, and that the military failed to detect, condemn or provide a proper judicial procedure according to the supposed attacks.
Burke says she is pursuing the top military leadership, as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture recompensation of the leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Your strategy: Instead of all the applicants to put their eggs in a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many further complaints to maintain pressure.
The Defence Team for the Defence Ministry, chaired by State Attorney Neil MacBride, has made an application to reject appeal.
The acts of the Court of Justice, which are available in Newsweek, include in detail the defence strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for infringements to which it has come into the forces.
On the basis of a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for infringements imposed on soldiers in the active service.
"The contemptful damage occurred during the military service of the applicant," the document states.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in battle, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers, two thirds of them died in battle actions.
It's time for the military to be modernized, says Burke.
And she is not there alone in her struggle: three more complaints except her are attached.
At the Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four major military academics because of the absurd promotion of a female enemy atmosphere.
Independently, Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "performance disturbance", which received rape victims to release them from the service - a usual approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group lodged a complaint against the Veterans Administration (i.e. the administration of the War Veterans), in which she prejudged her discriminatory practices in dealing with performance claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which offers a number of points of point.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (dt.: Office for Prevention and Reporting Sex Abuse) of the Defence Ministry of Defence, sexual abuses were shown 3.158.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the pentagon's own estimate, this number takes account of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19.000 cases to which it comes per year.
The report published in March also examines the rates of criminal persecution: in 2010 20 percent of the cases recorded came before court in the military, only half as many as civil law.
The applicants in Burkes case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the disgusting rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
This night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of police, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on her arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked for the sex she had before the attack with her friend.
Six persons pronounced as signs in the name of the condemnant who was finally released.
"I remember the day when the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the wounds would take place. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, "It wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared it incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed unreasonably, so she does not receive any support.
Whether the complaint, which Lyman and the other applicants have submitted, is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Legal Science at the George Washington University Law School.
Yet, he notes, "In my view, they should come forward."
What is between them and a judgement is this doctrine, which is criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military hangs a decade afterward, because they do not have the same incentive and the same horror that brings a liability.
He adds, "The chances are against them, but it is important for them to try it."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their way, Burke, the lawyer of the applicant, will begin with her hundreds of other complainants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms come about," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers observe you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to have committed an amok course in Norway in July, at which 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing before court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is not far alone in Cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time up to his attack before his computer and has chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-extreme groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log in to Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report from the UK idea factory DEMOS on digital popularity in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says that the researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the page to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as it has been for marketers for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans right-extremer groups throughout Europe and then showed them with adds, but instead of linking with a new band or a new diet product, the adds users invited them to an enquiry in which they were asked for their educational status, their attitude toward violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interrogate more than 10,000 of 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries without having to leave their office.
"It's a pretty new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprised. Online supporters right extreme groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising rotation, "the ones who combine their online activity with a offline activity are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and politicians use the site to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as in "Likes", text news and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding three content per day on average, Facebooks "Data Supernova" generates a research tree that increased the number of scientific works with the name of this page in the title of the last five years by nearly 800%.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page, which you usually do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to ask people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have granted them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, all of this falls away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their full noise on Facebook tend to drink more than students who are silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that similar students, such as resident consultants, monitor the site and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Co-author and Head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify threatened children that would otherwise not be found."
Facebook also constantly absorbs the data of its own population.
The data team of the page has produced statistics on relation status and Valentine's day, participation in the intermediate elections 2010 and a national happiness index (which was primarily used information on which only Facebook has access - Master of digital freedom has long known that the site should make its large data findings available for other research purposes.)
But the Facebook users know that the page they observe whether or not they want to. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the page to deliver your personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of an survey of which they don't even know anything about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines how to collect their data offline, online everything is allowed.
"I don't think that many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Consequently, in spite of its years of technology research, Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no replacement for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to take care of social - and a lot of social life is still taking place offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who held two amok runs at which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance Movement and a Temple Rider of Norway," he said before a court hall with more than 500 people.
"I raise objection to the court because you have received your mandate from organisations that support hassideologists and are thus supported by multiculturalism."
"I recognise the laws, but I do not confess guilty."
Judge Torkel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he did not want to give Brievik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views.
For the same reason he refused Breivik, who gave a premature speech, the permission to contact the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik should keep in investigation for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will check all visits and the entire correspondence for eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind the castle and riegel.
All took part in the aim that everything would run out of the way.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian transmitter NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a little further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik had a dark suit and a blue crochet and worked quiet and professional during the entire hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had had complications.
Some may like the attacks of July 22 seem to have been the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he does not," said the family of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did it."
7 lessons from the interview with the dead Steve Jobs, which this week was shown in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford and raised the technique genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple-Fans may find the most advisable job interview recently discovered, which was produced this week before special film presentations on the important markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and work processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed Hippie, but he was also an acribic organizer who was zealous of charts - a man who believed that many managers suffered from "a disease of thinking", "that a really great idea represents 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Idiotes" about the outbreak of the staff computer. And he sat for more than an hour with jobs in which they led one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, 10 years had passed since jobs had been forced from Apple. And he already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and he looked forward to the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in professional idiotes, he says that the copy templates of the interview were missing in delivery.
Only after job's death, a complete VHS copy was discovered in the warranty of the director.
This readily revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The lost interview", which comes to the Landmark theater this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is familiar with detailed interviews, jobs here appear surprisingly zealous in explaining his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds to meditate in which job is clearly weighing his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments in which jobs' perfectionism occurs when he seems to be impatient on Cringelys questions and pushes him to deal faster with issues or negotiations of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded, the lost interview seems somewhat unheartedly widespread when jobs evaluate what other companies do right or wrong and represent their own vision to the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthume reviews of the career jobs'. But jobs here to see as the greedy dreamer, which is on the jump to greatness, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Soon after he had done all this, he moved and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to conduct a company:
"In the whole year of business I always ask, "Why do you do things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's made easy."
No one knows why he's doing what he's doing. No one in business really thinks about things.
I found that.
Jobs continues his efforts to rationalize accounting at Apple.
Amazing how the cost was recorded - mostly it started with "standard costs" that were counted on merely suspected and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope became specialized:
Jobs tells us about the "Blue Box", he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be swallowed into the telephone company and managed to conduct remote conversations for nothing.
About the device has already been written a lot, but Job's enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as a act of self-authorisation is inflammatory.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a feeable phone, conducting a call and then connect from an AT&T network to another, while slinging as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when you cry into the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next hand," says jobs cooking.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell about a glorious strike that Wozniak and he nearly pulled off when they called through Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were able to make Henry Kissinger after.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself came to the phone.
How he was in love with technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12 when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute telephone jobs received part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen in my age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated his employees."
Later, jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever manufactured".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a little screen with brown tubes and I loved him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
During the interview, jobs talk about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he built some Platinums, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the collaboration and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he recalls the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember striking arguments... you cried me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15, which was unbelievable.
About large companies that leave:
Long before he resurrected Apple, jobs foretold the ways in which so many industrial giants rided with their visions in prides and lost control over their shares.
"Do we say you work at IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better copyer or printer, well?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it such people] that eventually lead the companies and the product with which people are forced from decision making.
The product genie that has led to this monopoly is needed by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craft art.
That happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
They caught the victory.
About innovation as art form:
"There is a lot of craft art between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You're learning a lot about his fees.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it goes out on the taste, it goes out that you try to put yourself apart with the best thing that people have created, and then try to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists clothe.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poetry, artists, zoologists, historians who are the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with opponents of health laws, as a court adopt case
On the day on which the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the political sharing question whether to listen to a contradiction of President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner that was disposed of by the court court that the case was represented before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met to a meeting to consult about the petitions for examination.
One of the cases to be addressed was a complaint that raised 26 states against the widespread reform of healthcare, which was decided last year by the Congress, a law which became a slogan for the conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, in March, a 5 1/2-hour base ndiskussion is expected, which is probably the result of which will encourage the 2012 presidency battle, which will be in full at the time when the judicial decision is announced.
The lawyer who stands before the court and claims that the law is to be crushed is likely to be Paul Clement, once a general prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two dozen companies who supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, an ancient group dedicated to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another company, the dinner sponsor, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who fight the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical agent Pfizer Inc., who is enormously involved in the result of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted the case in a Washington hotel.
Service had among other things Mitch McConnell, the Head of the Group of the Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health reform
The guests of dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have visited events of the federalist society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
Indeed, judges are free from the Code of Conduct which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge can participate in benefits events of closer and other organisations, where the judge must not be a speaker, an honorary guest or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas was sufficient to two of the branches in connection with the case as well as to a firm with a massive financial interest in this to alarm moral and government activists.
"This surprising fraction of morality and the contrary to the Codex punishes the complaints of some judges to lie, the court is adhering to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinned during a benefit event with lawyers with floating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support of a donation action for this event undermine any claim of inpartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would mix judicial matters too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a famous conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a state lawyer under the Obama government when the first legal statements came before court in the first instance.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of preconception, because it was too committed to the defence of the law to be unprecedented.
Kagan doesn't make any craftsmen to do this.
Boeing draws record order of 18 billion dollars to land
Airline Emirate orders 50 two-way aircraft of type Boeing 777 with one option to 20 other planes.
In addition, Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 billion.
It's really a rare message that a company gets a order of more than 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business if the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 aircraft in total is at a record sum of $18 billion.
Similarly, Boeing’s contractor is unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future flight orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East need 2.520 aircraft worth $450 billion in the next 20 years.
In the weekend, Boeing announced his largest job for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 double Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer order came from the Emirates airline from Dubai.
The airline also, Boeing announced it in 2011 on the Dubai air traffic view, has an option on the purchase of 20 other planes that make the total list price rise to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air then ordered six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, who greatly improved the petrol consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 billion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Börsenfachmann von Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by oil-producering countries.
So they do not only have the money to pay the aircraft. Rather, an increase in oil prices that usually harm airlines, as this is one of their largest cost points, is not so harmful, as the country earns a higher oil price.
This is important, as they tend to cancel or move flight orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural security," he said.
The ordering of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the market for large-space aircraft and helps keep the Airbus competitor SAS in chess that attacks the powering with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the aeroplane show comes four months after Airbus announced that you would move the introduction of the largest A350 which competes directly with the 777-300er.
The introduction was suspended to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher user load and range.
The Boeing shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses a choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers have supported Opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race around the governor posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed to have lost her application for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had affected the race for one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo won the race around governors' positions in the western state by the institutional party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys ... you occupied election cabins, built road blockades ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are looking for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just hit Cleron, who had been in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative party Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the Left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the Governor still in office, came to place three, a severe defeat for the split and luckless left leadership for the presidential election in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former Mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections with drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been dominated for a long time by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he elected Michoacan to start a military-directed offensive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still going on.
A PAN Mayor was killed a week before the election during a election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates have come out of fear from local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how dishonest the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the race around the President's office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory makes us look courageously in the next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the Eurozone in its severe debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend that will reduce Asia's economy's growth.
Rajat Nag, Administrative Director of the ADB in Manila, said that the two most rapidly growing economic nations of the world have to do "all things in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brasilien, Russia, India, China), who look "free" to the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia will help prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So everyone who can help Europe from this crisis is helpful," he said the Financial Times in an interview at the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected up to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all resources."
The European Monetary Union has led to a severe debt crisis over the past few months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have increased dangerously and the Prime Ministers have resigned from Italy as well as from Greece.
The upcoming severe debt crisis in Europe shocks the fear that the global economy could fall into the recession and led to calls that the leading threshold countries would have to do together to support the Eurozone.
Mr Nag foretold that any support from Asia is channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of the EU savings funds, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - will provide greater negotiations to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do everything in his power to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from the decreasing exports and drying out foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high growth level."
"It's not an option, it's a job, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have an incentive to help the rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the US Brown University, said that it would be very politically difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or less per day live.
"Every time they will find out that the Greeks are retiring with 50 and spending holidays at the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economy Forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in poor management, losses incurring such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the Eurozone will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The projection of the ADB with a economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for the years 2011/threates now "the risk of graduation" due to the threatening risk from Europe.
He said that vulnerable threshold markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital migration of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible defence cuts
Defence Minister Leon Panetta warmed the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed. He thus triggered a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civil flow bands.
The Pentagon already reflects reductions of $450 billion over the next decade, but now fears that further reductions will be needed by $600 billion or more if the congress cannot reach a conclusion in the expenditure.
Panetta wrote to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress to achieve a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called seizures, would lead to 23% general reductions and a stop of many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, carried out in such unconcerned way, would make most of our ships and construction projects incomplete - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernisation efforts," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be forced to unwillingly separate ourselves from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to advocate civilians with security-limited probability in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously harm our alarm willingness."
The cuts were finally hit the battle forces," said Panetta.
"While the war-time quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, serious intervention in the basic budget would have a negative impact on the efforts of war," Panetta warned.
"Personal settings were reduced, which would lead to delays in the attitudes and the postal supervision that supports war."
"The employees' wages would be reduced, which leads to late payments to war time dealers and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential influence of automatic reductions on the Defence Ministry.
"The consequences of a defence of the Defence Ministry would lead to a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military force."
"We are opposed to this draconic act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we can't live with, and it's certainly nothing to push us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to exclude the pentagon from reductions, it remains waiting.
Panetta has increasingly expressed the possible reductions, although he has been able to collect many years of experience with the budget at the Congress and White House before he arrived at the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is opposed to serious decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Defence Minister painted a dark picture that could be ahead - a military with shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air weapon swab without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paperdresser, a army of caserners, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission," said Panetta in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morality and alert willingness and that is not able to absorb it with potential opponents."
"It actually makes you angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details as to "reducing significant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global utilisation and effectiveness, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could fall to the victim of the defence, including those already tested and already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombing plane, the next generation of ballistic U-boats, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new soil battle vehicle that needs army and marine to replace the Humvee.
If you stop the further development and tests of the F35, this would save up to $80 billion in the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to upgrade, so that possible dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Discourage a Lie
A look at the current texts shows how considerable and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The presidential candidate of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is busy to become the charges of sexual harassment from several women.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of the Minid, as they claim to have retained reports after which a retired football trainer boy has sexually abused.
Last week an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to be a liar to American President Barack Obama, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Lies destroy career and shake countries.
The New York Congress Deputy and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became foolish when he put in circulation denials, which were very quickly rejected by inconsistent evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the infringement in the campaign funding, which is related to the distortion of an outer marriage affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced forgets the media circus, which President Bill Clinton triggered when he lied to Monica Lewinsky during his second term of office at the Oval Office.
Stories about shumbling in school and college tests are widespread.
There were incidents where teachers gave their students the test answers so that they were good at their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and shumbling are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie between 10 and 200 times each day.
Many of these lies, however, are considered to be an emergency lie.
Another study shows that strangers lie three times each other during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Discovering lies or "discovering lies" is one that is important to learn for every person, and this for both personal and professional reasons.
A wide range of societal games, such as scarlets, in which it is the goal of calling "Hab yourself!", is the disturbance of a misleading a serious field of knowledge, based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at respected universities that carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of Psychology and Physics.
One result of research is that most of the old myths have been distinguished about lying.
Lies look in your eyes.
They stalk, stamp, rode, and not always coat.
However, it must not be concluded that these liars are difficult to discover and to explore.
A practiced liemaker can go through to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim that fine face expressions, questioning and timing.
I have spent several years exploring the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing area of distress. And it is clear that the disturbance of a misleading is a modern ability to learn easily and help us to reconcile in our complex world, especially if the establishment or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belongs to our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good in estimating other people, inspiring their interests and controlling their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research we know that the extroverted people lie more frequently than introverted people, that men of frequent "self-oriented" lies optical than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly " fat lies").
We also know that if a person has been deceived as an offender, others feel less guilty to have lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by watching the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the subsequent assessment of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laugh, the quality of the voice of their testimony.
You should better know when someone usually triples with the foot, so that they do not blame him wrongly if he tribles with the foot during a meeting.
Then be careful for gathering up more remarkable and non-verbal behavior.
Consider these mountings as alarm bells that shrink, not as proof of distress.
People who deceive may stare when they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet turn towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position significantly or show a "depth of relaxation after the recruitment", this deep, relaxing breathing and the change in the attitude when all hard questions are over.
Asking often indicates falsely that a recruitment talk is over only to keep a look after this relaxation after the recruitment.
Also, consider the language of your experimental person.
The outbreaker of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past form when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Wrong people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tough question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a thorough question, "Well... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... according to best knowledge and conscience."
This will make the answer more perceptive than fair, which often shrinks the alarm bells.
There is no magic to distinguish lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which a distress is possible.
Thanks to these skills, everyone can become the victim of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after threat by delayed US authorisation
Just a few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the authorisation of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, with which the trade unions were annoyed and at the same time calmed environmental protectors, the pipeline-building companies are trying to re-plan the project so that they can return to normality.
On Monday evening, TransCanada said that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the ecologically sensitive area of the sandhills to Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Parliament building.
Alex Pourbax from TransCanada said that the company continues to be confident that the pipeline is finally approved, even with another course.
After announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, a decision on a federal permit for the project would be taken until the new possible course was reviewed that avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may take a decision by 2013 after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama explained last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and gave its support.
The 1700 miles pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700 000 Barrel oil per day from Alberta Province to the raffinadery in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmental protectors hate them, but labour markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 200,000 jobs.
However, the lawyers of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a departure from the region of sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project has little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy economy states that the principal auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate end of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist set by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was advisor of Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company who was assigned to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, since it is connected with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused, as she was supposed to have a baby in fear of breaking
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had had a tobacco attack that would be so scared of her little daughter that she had survived fear.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18 months old Genevieve Monk so afraid that she suffered from "performance changes, sleep disturbance" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10, last year, when the stageworker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a child gardener, and Genevieve wanted to break up for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk went with the baggage and Genevieve on the arm into the lobby in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"Nobody appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She became angry and began to shrink - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started chickening water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look at what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle crashed on the mother who still wore Genevieve on the arm, and had to be held back from her accompanying and moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby shouted so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later the LaBelle family asked for a excuse in writing, but did not receive an answer.
LaBelles lawyer and representative did not respond to calls in which an opinion was requested.
The complaint is on a non-decisive compensation, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he would not pay a fee and plan the family, the money they receive, will provide the child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for their behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is put on a child gardener toward the babies wearing an 18-month-old baby on the arm."
Climate disturbances brake the economy
In the first year, in which Mario López Valdez is on the government, the unemployment and black work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investments decreased and the economy stacked.
It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who called himself the initiator of change and made great hopes about economic growth, is on the government. However, as a result of the climatic disturbances, growth cannot be the point of decreasing the main economic indicators.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in millions of agricultural levels but also strictly limited the growth of the state economy and caused a general decrease in economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first quarter of the year, mainly the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 per cent, which slowly affected further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (i.e. Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) on the effects of the frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural holdings, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were partly destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican State. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment, since from January to March 55 053 inhabitants had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the labour population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased to 5.28 per cent and from July to September to 6.19 per cent, resulting in 74 000 unemployment in Sinaloa.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is due to several factors. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences at the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions declaring indirectly the growth of unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, it is not easy for those who are banning dollars to let them work, invest or use them for themselves," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growth in unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country looking for work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased. This is due to the problems of entry and, on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work, which causes unemployment to rise," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, taking into account the high proportion of black work, which includes 60.38% of the employees in the country who work without paying in the social security cash.
Unemployment and black work are the lowest wages throughout Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institute) and the Secretariat del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of employees in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September; this is much less than the general government average, which is at 7375 pesos.
Decline in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and growth in unemployment, the strongest decrease in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretariat de Economía (State Economic Authority) the ADI was from January to June 630 597 dollars, which corresponds to 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, which comes from companies from the tertiary sector in front of all things.
The Debts
In the light of the economic crisis, the national government in July requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 communities. The country convention approved a sum of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive effects of debt on any of the industries in the country were found until November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, the first government year made Mario López Valdé's inability to do so.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación, represented that no effort was made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very difficult this year. It has to be worked hard to recover the terrain lost this year and we have to do a dual effort in 2012. The efforts of all, and especially the progress of the already well-coherent government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated," he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events, such as the Frost at the beginning of the year, made the country’s economic development difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not in motion enough to produce an economic dynamic that could produce a acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore we will finish the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine Profession
The Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Entrepreneurial Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, explained that it was necessary to make the State more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme for re-determining the economic profession and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that leads the government's efforts into better railways.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has come forward, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in the government.
"There are areas that can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work in front of it," he said.
Arrest due to 8 kg marijuana
Five years of prison and 100 days were condemned by Navolato because of the ownership of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic's prosecutor announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a criminal offence against public health, here the ownership of marijuana.
According to the Act AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican military on 7 June 2010 in the monitoring of Cipriano Valdez road against the guard heading No 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug small dealer drove in a white delivery car, in which he stored a black bag in a box in the car and on the driver’s seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the contested product was handed over to the judge of the district and the punished person remains in the executive.
Debts for construction work
The social buildings provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed because of lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The leader of the City Authority for Social Development explained that although the construction programmes have already been advanced, they are now in danger, since the government has not paid the funds to be allocated to them that exceed 11 million peso for the three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now only the Federación and the municipality would have contributed to the construction work, which would have been expected to delay the construction.
"12 million have to pay for them, and although the year is already going to end, they have not given us a penny, and that, although they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "In order not to be late, we have already started building work, and they have already been far advanced, but we need the money."
He emphasized that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla the State had not fulfilled its obligations, so the municipality had to take up a 7 million loan at the beginning of its government, which is the amount that the central government had to have.
"It had gone so during the last legislative period, because the State had not sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to obtain the funds that the State had not set up to participate in these programmes," he explained.
Although the governments were obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administrative Affairs and Finance, was asked to accelerate the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"At least 12 million million they have to assist, and although the year is already ending, they haven't given us a penny."
The Court approved the transition to the digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals in recent years is part of the world's most important changes.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints submitted by the Senate and the parliamentary House against the Presidial Departure and by which the transition of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be preceded, due to the lack of eight votes necessary for legal defence.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his competence when he published the Decree of Law with details on the transition to the terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, since it did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
The project for the complaint drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the Decree of the Law be declared unconstitutional, as the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the regulations relating to radio and television, and that is why the Decree would oppose the hierarchical principles and the precautions of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Members were constitutional objections against the Decree of Law. After the complaints were adopted, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree of Law and set up all activities for the establishment of digital transfer.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Members without joining in the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed that he would not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government should not regulate the measures to be taken by public administration by general rules.
"I also do not believe that, if you would do this, the independence of the regulatory body would be affected", it also reminded that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, as it leads the state affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have been made throughout the world in recent years, and it results in a better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The suspension of the change, she said, was a delay in the use of digitalisation, which is a decision in public interest that does not only have technical aspects, "because they are about economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, they stressed, "required the operation of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of economic governance by the State, they included a group of characteristics that lay the constitution in the hands of the central government."
She called in memory that many countries had already carried out the digital conversion worldwide, over the government, although they had highly specialized institutions.
It was not possible to conclude that the government would have a maturity in the competences of the Congress, as the laws adopted by the legislative would comply with the issue of the contested legal degree," she assured.
The possibility of individually counting the voting list in Michoacán is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor is nearly 27 per cent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 still not counted.
The possibility of a single telling of the voting list this year is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data published by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in governor elections is nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet being counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded that just on 9 November last, the electoral body had adopted a number of rules for harmonisation of local rules with the reforms of the state in election matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had neither its political constitution nor his electoral law nor his law on election law adapted to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that these had not entered into force in this round of elections. The governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the state indicator within the time limits set for it, with the argument or objections to it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional matter submitted by the local legislation and assessed the State Representative's vote on the Constitutional Reforms as "invalid and unlawful", as it does not have the right to "decide or put a veto against it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview on the possibility of individually telling the votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM, the local electoral authority has now the possibility of partially or fully telling the voting list.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more election packages may be partially counted The results of the protocols do not agree; the Protocol on Voting and Calculation is not actually available or it is not owned by the Chairman of the Election Committee or there are obvious errors or amendments to the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of the fully filled voting certificates may be carried out if there is a difference between the contested winner and the one standing in the second place that is equal or less than one percentage, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party-to-coalition chairman who is the second of those candidates.
The vote counting may also take place in its entirety if, after the conclusion of the ordinary calculation, the difference between the contested winner and the candidate at the second place is equal or less than a percentage, provided that an explicit request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become the second. In this case, the election packages which have been exposed to a partial explanation would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is nearly 0.16 per cent, although the votes of 129 of the total of 923 election protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ash will be spread over the Zapalinamé mountains, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés threw down this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday the dead show and a dead fair took place.
According to family members, the last will of the chief luitenant was that his ash would be spread over the Zapalinamé mountains.
After a honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, with the other people who died in the accident, in a plane of the Mexican Air Force, to the capital of Coahuila. The next person attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.

Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the air weapon of Zapopan, Jalisco.
Some couldn't get it because they thought it would even distort him on a truck. Still, he always strived to realise his dream of becoming pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he had traveled to Zapopán to graduate his family. Therefore he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
A last goodbye
The Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all honor under the governor Jorge Torres López. Your honor gave him the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the school leaders and students of the Saltillo Technology Education Institute, where he studied in 1985, both in study and in sports.

On Wednesday Education of the new Italian Government
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets with the President of Italy tomorrow to imagine this the new government that has led Italy at the edge of the economic collapse to offer.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets with the President of Italy tomorrow to imagine this the new government that has led Italy at the edge of the economic collapse to offer.
A communication from the presidential palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet with the President of State, Giorgio Napolitano, in order to confirm government education.
It is assumed that he will present a majority of a cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will enter his office.
Monti said that he would present to the President the results of the discussions with the political parties on government education.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalist.
Monti did not expressly confirm governmental education, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The frame is now well stuck," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of debt to an inexpensive amount.
The new government, led by the former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a hard spare package that has been demanded by the euro politicians in order to recover the envisaged confidence in Italy.
The pressure on the prompt of Monti was still increased by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of the taxation of Italian government loans for 10 years with 7 percent interest, which corresponds to the situation where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue protection screen.
Emma Marcegalia, President of the Confindustria Italian Industrial Association, told the press after a meeting with Monti, "We said we would support this government after all the powers."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
The success chances of Montis were significantly increased by supporting the Party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to withdraw on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are determined to bring good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Middle Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, because so far, many of its members have spoken against a majority of the Technocrats government, which is just forming Monti.
Assistance from Parliament
The new Monti Government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the most likely unpopular savings measures.
Resistance to his efforts or the delay in reforms could lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks exercises pressure with its indication that a failure of Montis is a disaster, as well.
Monti started on Monday with its discussions with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurial organisations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
During the evening, the session is to be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, which has launched an extremely rapid change in government in response to the crisis.
Following the recent inhalation by the end of the last week, when it was known that Berlusconi would withdraw, the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister has reached the costs of Italian government loans again.
A rescue of Italy with a government debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his government must last until the next elections that are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of prefering the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the large parties are insisting that this should consist only of technicians, an indication of their concerns in the light of the pressure imposed on the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and the disagreements between the parties make the involvement of persons from political life complicated.
Spaniers have more games than the Ticos
From the 22 players from Spain, ten over 50 international games are on the buckel.
From Costa Rica's pages only one of the 22 calls has 50 games behind.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendship game that is taking place today at 15.05 p.m. at San José National Stadium.
While the world and Europe champion, the number one on the monthly ranking of the FIFA, can look back to a considerable number of selection games of class A, the three-coloured team only has the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
This figure he reached on the last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup Champions League) as well as high-level Europeancups as the Champions League.
In addition, experiences with the Spanish Furie in complicated excretion games at Eurocup and the football world championships come.
On the other hand, the Tico footballers have few international meetings in the context of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA rank list at the bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: The Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached an equality with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on the last Saturday against England (Labour 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-coloured team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi received even an recognition of UEFA last week, together with others of the Iberian team who had reached the magic number 100: the Zibizarreta quoted with 126 and the middle storms of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, the left side storm Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there only five of over 30 games came: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Those with the least games.
Less than 30 games show in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the sides of the National Team comes to less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20's boundary.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, listed in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson had not their debut yet.
The historical gatekeeper of Spain is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has shot with nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett referred to Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate his twenty years of existence.
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that works"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of its best concerts on the next Sunday.
Over 20 years they were expected, but the band assured that when they play in Costa Rica, a dream will come to them.
This insured the Bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from a exclusive interview last week from Brazil.
The band is located in the south-American part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they appear at the National Stadium from 19.30 a.m., together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read an excerpt from the conversation whose complete copy can be found in La Nación’s online edition.
For your costarican fans a dream comes when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that works for us as well.
This is just the second time that we play in South America and Central America, and until now it has been great.
I've only been on vacation in Costa Rica once. It's such a beautiful country that we will certainly stay there a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you because the fans of the band are completely devoted, and they're experiencing the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thanks for standing on our side all these years.
We spent almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry to have spent so long until we came here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the largest show of the year.
Doesn't this practice some pressure from your visit?
Some of the most great shows we have been doing in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we like to play there.
We love this country, we love to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle. Costa Rica belongs to the best countries in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend living in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always been travelling to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are to surf. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tour, you offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we have no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile stock.
You never repeat your stock.
Why?
I think this is partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so that the decision we will play is not easy.
If we take up two or three songs that we haven't played for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they call us the reasons in memory why these songs have pleased us. Otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour, you celebrate your twenty-year-old story.
If you look back, is it hard to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I believe that no one of us has imagined playing in a great rock tape, and that is also for over 20 years. This works like a dream.
We also continue to put on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together too now.
We like and are excited about making music.
We're lucky to get to the places of the world we've always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birthday of the Grunge?
It has always been a honor to belong to this group of large bands.
We're good friends with people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement comes from a group of friends.
Sometimes a band goes out of a city, but it is already unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year, we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound gardens on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with them all and we are honored to be part of this seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) fell to us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands over.
First of all, I believe that we all appreciate the happiness of being still alive and also care for each other.
We are all close friends, so musical ways have opened up, which give every individual the freedom to experiment.
One knows the other and its music, and it couldn't be better for us.
Your relationship with praise has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We are sure not too often to be on tour, because it is too easy to waste this game with huge masses that love your music.
As long as you remember that people have come for music, this reminds you that you have to respect the music and what she has called into life, without being a famous rock star.
What reminders do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
We were disappointed about having needed so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Greg) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or pictures, I remember what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a joy to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore the band selected for opening?
Yes, production sent us videos from several groups and this tape liked us best. So we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. This is certainly exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow leather beds when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He's singing him, and I believe he's singing the first thing that's gonna happen to him.
Who'd influence you as a bassist?
From so many+
Among the first ones I find, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists that like me.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep the grave alive, even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think we all feel not very related to the word Grunge.
When I think of this, I find the bands that I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all others who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find this great because it is worth hearing this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem somewhat easy. But there are also other songs such as The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in themselves.
To both the tears came when I heard Ed play it. It's very dark songs.
I think if you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - this affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs make it clear to me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical studies
The former President Alberto Fujimori was sent to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his home doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is arrested for 25-year infringements of human rights during his reign period (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is four times operational and under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, congress member and his personal doctor, told the television that Fujimori would be investigated for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the cause of his pain and muscle loss in the lower parts.
Aguinaga commented that his opinion was that Fujimori could be punished for humanitarian reasons, but he did not wish this because he considers him innocent.
He has been operated four times on tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilograms of weight. Other diseases such as a severe erosive gastrotitis, a cyst in the stomach chest, kidney stones, high blood pressure and diarrhoea problems in the legs included the doctor.
Fujimori has been located in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruan army, who was secretly active during his government period.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official settlement, referred to by the Uruguay President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, starts their visit from Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between two countries and discuss political issues of the region
The next Wednesday Mujica meets his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón. This will, according to the Uruguay President, be the highlight of his planned agenda with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collaboration of the Uruguayians living in Mexico.
The meeting of both Presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," announced the President's office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica was looking for Calderón's support in relation to the incident with France when the French Head of Government Nicolas Sarkozy set the South American country on a list of tax paradises at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries who still appear as tax paradises from the international Community, which was rejected by Uruguay and led to a request from his ambassador in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has been chaired by the G20, a group consisting of the world's most powerful thresholds and industrial countries. Since January this year there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double layout with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has tried to accelerate the conclusion of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organisation (OECD), which does not include countries which have introduced all international standards on tax cooperation.
At business level, there has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
With "Super Mario 3D Land" the narrow installer enters the third dimension
For 25 years Super Mario has struggled inevitably for the rescue of Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but never yet in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D country" he struggles for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that this month comes to the stores of all the world has been cut to the properties of the portable console Nintende 3DS, with which no special glass can be played three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that has to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Álvarez, responsible for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain in the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo that has been developed from the beginning for this console" because so far, success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were already existing track adjustments.
The speaker of Nintendo emphasized that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "sustainable" video game that allows a quick, liquid game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "slight" to capture the less shocked users.
Afterwards, experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of games, which become more and more difficult.
In real time, users can choose between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects" must always be played three-dimensionally.
This trip Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has no longer been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twins to the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last editions: The sniffy installer must overcome with dangers spotted platforms to liberate the Princess Peach.
However, the player has news about the movements, the environment, clothing and enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillos delivery to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would take place the delivery of the former governor Alfonso Portillo in order to be responsible in the United States for the merger of $70 million money laundering.
Thus, the process of the United States' application for Portillo's delivery ends, so that it can be made before the court there.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of justice and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He stressed that he did not intervene in judicial decisions during his government and put in place all the requests for delivery from which he was informed.
Except Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and severe body injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's approach is a governmental act that will take place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation is cleared in Guatemale and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the destruction of 120 million Quetzales in the Defence Ministry during his government period. This negotiation was preceded by the delivery, but the minister put in opposition and revived the case in a new way.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was launched to prevent the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Assistance Organization have led to important results: 6000 young people, threatened by social exclusion, were supported in this quarter century to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary day yesterday, an event was held in the former works buildings of Fabra i Coats, which took over 300 persons part.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the Trinita Vella district with the aim of helping young people with a low level of training, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At the yesterday celebration in Sant Andreu, many responsible bodies and institutions attended the association in these 25 years.
Participation of political representatives from different directions to election times proved the inpartiality of Trinijove's work.
Apart from the President-in-Office of the Generalitat (Parlament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of the former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and the former Mayor and currently the Left-Green City Council of Ricard Goma.
The Great Hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalonian Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was put into life in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good basis".
For the President-in-Office of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example of fighting against difficult circumstances and giving people hope in difficulties.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he does," he explained.
A occupied house in which giant parties were organised was cleared
The house owners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street of Balmes No 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve house owners left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
Everything points out that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 have found an end on the street of Balmes.
Twelve people were voluntarily leaving the building that they held illegally occupied and organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair.
After the space, the door lock was exchanged to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," confirmed the house manager.
The house owners who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of the building were inhabited - took the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. In addition, they had painted the walls and left all types of waste, especially doses with alcoholic drinks.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days, and the tenants were driven to despair.
Besides the building, there is a discothek, Balmes 51, which also had damage to it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, declared Europe Press that her business had been declined by 80% since the start of the house occupation.
The owner of the Discothek pointed out that the house owners made her unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the Discothek.
In addition, the owner of the recreational room had been shown by the neighbors for rest disruption, while, according to her statement of noise, the visitors of the disco did not touch, but by the house owners and in particular by the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which, according to the angry neighbors' statements, became increasingly more and longer in the past weeks.
The discothek officer explained that the harassment had been so great that it was agreed with the owner of the building that no rent had to be paid for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (Stadt Police) also confirmed that it has received more complaints from the neighbors in recent weeks.
The Chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - Volkspartei) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week to clear the building immediately and address the problems of civil cohesion and the downturn of the city district.
He explained that before summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that the house owners had been in all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments in the past months. In some, it even came to thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to the unlawfulness and to intervene against the social acts of the building."
Yesterday, another building in the district of Nou Barris was removed by the Catalonian police.
At 15.30 a.m., the police approached the road Montral No. 35 after having received a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the invitation to tender, apart from the disputes on the honorars.
The urban procurement on the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 1980s, at the highlight of the disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its decoration on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the decline of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many again became the upper border of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not spreading in the north-south direction, but upwards (berg) and down (more).
The classification of Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.
Yellowstone, with wild pigs in the role of the Yogibert, served as an example.
As far as the city was concerned, there were 16 competitions in September, when the city issued a huge invitation for further access stores to Collserola.
No doubt a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either it is, or someone's planning to put gates on the land.
The question is: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The invitation to tender is not only from an organisational viewpoint, but also with regard to a reflection on the city the subject of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is already almost a reciprocal topic that two members of this old cast, which meet in the elevator, can go back to.
And exactly this fact provides the substance for one of the rare agreements between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The invitation to tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary", after the attack on the coast, to speak about the "Front at the mountain", as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out over the green apples.
"You should assume the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it's good access.
Collserola is more complex", condemned the architect, for which the title "Ture of Collserola" is a "lexical trap" in itself: you may not "conceive it as an access to a park, but as a restriction of areas to which trade must be done."
Modol, such as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal a "intellektual challenge", which presents "some dangers".
Dangers due to the "uncertainty that brings the design of a public space today" according to the experiences of the 1980s that had their "swan song" in the field of the Forum.
The first fear is its own limitation to what is allowed to be built.
"Limit something always means to set the next step," i.e. to exceed it.
"You need to think about new urban planning instruments because the current [relatated to the plan General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real catastrophe."
Modol, who is closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that is not towards Barcelona", for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola that should not "shove on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that she has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the nearness of the mountain is to the city of leadership, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "twisty" of whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams that were launched in life ("he says the right one," we architects should only be one tool."
Bayona indicates that the answer to the question in the headline of this article is complex, since in the terms of the tendering conditions there is no global view of Collserola: "There were 16 competitions written in the cross-section," he says, "on the axis of mountains. But there are no long-sectional perspectives that the area as a whole looks at."
At least in his case, this has led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project for a gate would collide with the architect of the gate.
Its opinion is that the city should ensure that the stripes are equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt throughout its length, which creates a soft transition between city and green zones.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal who gets free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of the Casino Red liberated the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the process that is led against him for discouragement.
After 72 days of prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the representative of the Casino Red has forgiven him before the second court of the district which leads the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for depression.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to be seen, who mutatis mutandis forced him to pay a sum of money to allow the city administration to approve the secret operation of the contesthouse.
After the penalty notice, the prosecutor opened a criminal procedure against the brother of the Panist mayor, which was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministry of Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antigua of the capital.
In this place he remained 49 days after a second arrest order after the official of the Ministry of Público had rejected the crimes due to coupling and organised crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's prison because he had mutatis mutandis confronted the owners of the Casino Red with a half million pesos. On the other hand, he stayed only a few hours in the middle security area, as murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the judicial proceedings as an insasse of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, sent him a prison regulation which found that after the almost two months of investigations, there are sufficient evidence to speak guilty of Jonás for the payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the contesting house to open this against.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor's brother, to punish him, so he will be put free in the next hours.
During the judicial hearing Ramiro Arias, the official of the court-owned Ministerio Público, García Gomez, asked whether he had corrected the damage and who the owner of the contesthouse had expressed his forgiveness. However, the lawyer held the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is freely spoken. Even in the following cases there are no objections to the proceedings, and no compensation for damage is required.
After hearing the representative of the competition house at 15.50 a.m. Larrazabal Bretón, Larrazabal Bretón was immediately set free.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to announce Jonás that he was released and his case was laid to the documents.
He also informed him of the judicial arrangement for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the aircraft accident at which government secretary Francisco Blake and seven other persons died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven persons died were found to point out that the helicopter with its entire unconstrued structure was stabbed directly against the ground without the pilot could have initiated an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communication and Transport, said that the pilot had confirmed that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight before the start.
"The fact that the propeller wing had contact with trees in 25 meters of height, with the helicopter losing the rump, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several soil contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of staff.
In addition, he said that no helicopters were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had fallen.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found at other places, the strike covered the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area shows a shaft of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is important to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but they may take several months, perhaps even a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter of Estado Mayor Presidencial was flying with travel speed and the plane fell to a soft hang.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the explosion."
At a press conference, the Head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points to be taken into account during the investigation:
Visibility:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the vision flight, which means that the crew should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reported appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deeply hanging clouds increased.
Selected routes:
It is possible that the crew had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca valley because of the clouds.
Headline:
The climbing coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Possibly there has been no control loss on the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route before the climb.
Distribution of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to now indicates that the helicopter was in the right and side direction.
The pattern of the scattered airplanes is likely that the helicopter was sprayed up on the ground with its unconceived structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane offer at the accident site do not let fire or explosion be closed.
The last findings indicate several soil contacts.
In the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The area is dissolved and shows a shaft of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to have gone to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several soil contacts.
After a minutious search in an area beyond the locked area of the accident site, no distributed aircraft parts were found, which strengthened the assumption that the uninfected aircraft structure had been sprouted against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for the detection of the gene for fattyness
The Mexican Social Insurance Institute is conducting a research project for the detection of the gene for fattening in children and adolescents supported by the IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is conducting a research project for the detection of the gene for fattening in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of fat in childhood and youth", with which the genetic marks are to be found in conjunction with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department for Medical Research, Focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students from postgraduate studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interesteds can come to the IMSS sports places in the Tal of Mexico, where every Saturday will be carried out tests with children and adolescents from 8.00 a.m. on Saturday.
He stressed that the investigation started at Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and continued on the Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) since 8 October.
When the goal has been achieved from 500 to 600 investigators, the study will continue at the sports area of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed on the one of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the objective of the study was to identify the factors and the role of genetics in the development of fatty life and the identification of risk factors for mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the basis of the global day of diabetes, he stated that it was endeavored that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 years of age should fill with the consensus and under the supervision of their parents with food-related questionnaires.
You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He further indicated that the investigators (weight, size, number of valleys), controlled their blood pressure and determined blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (examination of genes associated with fattening in childhood).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out in the event of healthcare professional concerns about the alarming weight increase in young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in nearly six years, the proportion of fatty boys increased by 77 percent and the girls with fattening increased by 47 percent. Also, overweight has increased dramatically," the IMSS specialist stressed.
He claimed that the search for genetic marks was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differs from the other people.
He claimed that an (e) Mexican (in) average is 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent of African descendants, which reflects in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of fattening are incapable of burning off the surplus of energy (calorias) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the investigators was in a comprehensive study of the children to determine whether they were excessive or fatty.
It would even examine the presence of dark skin folding in the neck and in the inner arm (akanthosis), which indicates the probability of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stadium.
All information would be treated confidentially and the parents would be told by the doctors in writing. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and suggest changes in lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, fattyness and other chronic diseases: lack of movement, i.e. lack of movement in everyday life, spending most of the day before the TV and using transport agents instead of walking short ways.
The high calories intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbon hydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt prevented by UNAM sludges
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico of UNAM developed modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs that come from the road coating would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 sludges when the raining time at Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City area of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Najera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warned and assured that if the excavation and maintenance of the asphalt coating is appropriate, the number of sludges will be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Slowers from a technical point of view", which he held to chemistry at the time of the International Year, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, which, however, has a greater mechanical resistance both at high and at low temperatures.
Mrera Najera said that this type of modified asphalts in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road coating and thus avoid the appearance of sludges.
He explained that the asphalt - the most severe part of the oil - is a carbon hydrogen compound, of which some have a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthen. Together, they give to the road coating its characteristic telastic behavior.
The denelastic behaviour of the asphalt means that at high temperatures of nearly 180°C it behaves like a liquid, at 120°C it is very thin and almost fixed at 50°C, while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistability of asphalt on the roads is not equal, but changes on one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer concluded.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of a flexible road coating composed of six materials layers, of which the last three asphalts included.
Between the top layers lies a layer of asphalt, which consists of small, asphalt bathed and then fixed stones.
Each single stone of this clothing layer was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles are moved on and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road coating.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemistry engineer.
"About the cutting layer," he explained, "was a last layer designed, the so-called coating layer made of small stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical force than the trailing layer and it must produce vibration.
The most powers received and distributed by this road coating also require an appropriate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially moisture and temperature fluctuations, are further, important factors to take into account, above all things the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the cutting layer.
When the terrain is moist, water blows into the layer and enters hard again. This causes a destruction of all layers of the road coating and consequently the appearance of sludges.
When a hithole arises, he said, "will first be taken off the cover layer, while the closure layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage does not arise immediately, but it is a process that must be maintained by appropriate maintenance programmes for the first signs."
The member of the Sistama Nacional de Investigadores (Mexico’s National Research System) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause for the appearance of sludges. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road coating must always be proportionate to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent sludges.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research, for example through asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, with which the sludges were easily and without application of high temperatures.
What was missing by the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th mistitler.
Again, Valle del Cauca left empty when giving the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winner stage, a silver crown and the band that she proved to be a new Miss Colombia.
With the result of this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took up the crown and the cedar, the departamento is already on 14 mistitles and Melina is one of the legends of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown. Among the proclaimed misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many ask today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite girl who had shown at every presentation that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been chosen as a queen of the police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that also received the beauty kings Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor, which is decisive for the decision of the jury to designate it as the first Miss, is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "What book has influenced you most and why?" which Martín Murillo Gómez had asked her by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in literature, I think it's a way to civilize itself, finally I believe that the book that was the strongest for my childhood, 'The little prince', is a pretty deep book.
At present, I read `Schuld and Honor'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I just read a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that 'Leaderships' heats.
An answer that came to a little counter-love, first because of the term `civilize' and second because she had not explained concretely in what way any of her books had influenced her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina explained to feel quiet and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people: Please read a little 'The little prince'. It is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that it was the preferred one who had inherited all the incidents and who had received all the prizes in advance (gastronomy competition Easter, audience vote on the best hand cutting costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had been jealous of what the Queen stressed, which couldn't shine on the stage."
And this was noticed at their first show in the bathing suit at the beach of the Hilton hotel and at their two lifts at the crown celebration.
Even though she was safe at both, she lacked the power and swing of Magdalena and Atlántico's representatives.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the Como en casa programme at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned as a Miss, "that the candidate, who wins most prices during competition, finally does not become a queen."
In addition, Valle went away to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jury regarding its interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty competition.
It will have his reason that two days before the assembly of the International Jury Lucy Doughty, they were looking for a woman engaging in the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the body and focus on social feelings, that she had been involved in projects before taking part in the competition," she explained.
It is also imagined that Valle had sinned with its defects of the derrists and the fibrose that was noticed in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for ‘natural beauty’ with a healthy body, good dietary habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body that it was better, "but her problem with the fibrose on the abdomen, which was hardly noticed to me honestly, pushed her score on the last day."
In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to let them do right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay her."
Because of this prize, for the first time forgiven by the National Beauty Competition, after the appearance of the bathing suit, a cruel prediction that was to be true in the night. It was twisted that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price in order not to let them come into the enjoyment of the crown.
Whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina will enter her rule year from now on, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent at appointing the national beauty competition of Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, as one of the queens, who had escaped the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, she will come into history.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lobhoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4th, a lobhoscope of the State Attorney Unit (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armies of Colombia) was "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lobhoscopies in the CTI department, this week, Eliazar González had prepared service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in criminal investigation procedures.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he should identify were.
In 2000 he resided to Valle over and after completion of the necessary courses, he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to frictions, i.e. the hand- and foot surfaces.
In the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big expected him.
On Friday night, he fled in the helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspicion was that one of the man who had led the oldest Guerrilla in the world could be the one. Therefore he should take the ten fingerprint of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not the least similar to the pictures he had seen in the mass media.
He had no bart, was dressed like a farmer in the area, had no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints aren't lying.
Armed with a lupe, ink, a cable and a pocket lamp compared Eliazar the fingerprints of the body with those on the print sheet.
He had seen it right: it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for informing the Defence Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the Head of the FARC.
Searching tracks
For a Dactyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the assessment given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a precise science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the settlement of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery matters and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals submit false certificates or they do not have any.
We take them the fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that at a steal he had to screw a piece of wall out of a house, because the thief had stuck up with his hand in this place when he pulled out a safe full of decorated with jewelry and money.
"Wands are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for the removal of fingerprints. But in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several steels," he recalled.
With the fingerprints, murder suspiciouss can also be discharged or charged.
Recently, a dead one surrounded by snap bottles was found.
In the detection, it was suspected that a family member could be suspicious, and in fact a fingerprint was agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is linked to the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscopy of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a band will be used to take it.
Then the prints will be sent to Asif, that's the criminal database, or to the person status office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without certificates," explained the expert from the CTI.
He said not everything was like it was represented in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is, what is glossy, not all you touch is a fingerprint.
Yet, it can be used when performing a corresponding comparison.
The "employment" demands the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrants joined themselves in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
A large part came after the space order and switched its location to a nearby park.
On this Tuesday, the members of the movement of Ocupy Wall Street invited the authorities of New York when they tried to enter the Manhattan place again with a judicial order after they had been removed from the place in the morning and tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators pushed themselves together before the Zuccotti Square, on which they had a judicial arrangement which allowed the "emptors" to enter the new tent in this place. While there was another part of the movement, they kept on the space command and occupied a park north in the city where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the site, we find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray argued that the reply of the "Emphores" to the departure of her tent camp, which had been directly arranged by Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of New York, came before court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the violent space of the place and approved the tent by the demonstrators.
In addition, the "Emphorts" occupied a new park that is located at the crossing of the central Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least one hour. But afterwards the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give precise numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had seen several journalists with handcuffs.
The organisation assured that hundreds of people were found in this place, where a section of religious leaders had also arrived as signs of their support to the members of the movement and to intermediate with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a private property area) remains closed in the expectation of a judicial hearing which is still held for this Tuesday and which will analyse the legality of the spaces held in the morning grey.
Some of the demonstrants who were driven from the place had photo copies of this judicial arrangement with themselves and distributed them. They even gave them some policemen who guarded the place, which resulted in "a few small collisions", as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had struck demonstrators.
The judicial instruction prohibits the authorities from removing members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "sites adopted after the occupation and prohibiting the return of the demonstrations to the park with their tents and other things they used before."
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that the reopening of the public transport and demonstrators had been lifted by this judicial arrangement. Demonstrants pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleep bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the space of the Zuccotti Square, which was arrested nearly 200 people in the morning, and which was decided because the demonstrators "should the right."
Bloomberg declared that he had given the order to make space because he had "converted to a place where people did not show, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people", because "some business had been threatened" and the residents feared "for their quality of life".
"The space in the morning grey was incredible and shows that Bloomberg is essentially interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North American workers," added the speaker of the movement accusing the mayor to "do not respect the freedom of the press".
The managers of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they thought to organise "great actions" for Thursday, together with municipal organisations and trade unions, to remember the two months that the protest has taken since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allens Assistant in "Home Improvement", Rescue Swimmer in "Baywatch", Rabbits at "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary at a Christmas broadcast of the Canadian TV.
The private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson and the "crooner" (Balladen singer) Michael Bubblé and other Canadian fames will occur on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will inherit a very special virgin Mary's life.
CTV today distributed pictures of the TV program, where Anderson - which also appears for the dissemination on the Internet of a self-turned porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the slayer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, as a virgin Mary with a doll in the shot that Jesus is supposed to represent.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comic Indian origin, who recently worked as a modernist at the mission "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, than Jesuskind.
The CTV Christmas program is not only based on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bubblé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and which is not far away.
Recently, Bubblé had called the North American Kim Kardashian "Hure" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan will be reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, which is still in the healing of the destructive earthquake, which entered into a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced in World War II.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo assessed the damage to damage to $300 000, a hit that seems to weaken despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters, the data on the gross domestic product were used to finalise this chapter from July to September: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the quota calculated to the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
Resurrection can be explained in part by the machine sale for reconstruction of the areas destroyed by earthquake and the following Tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the fall by 0.9% for investments recorded from January to March, the first fall after six months of uncontinuous increases.
Nevertheless, the actual reversal of the Japanese economy is not based solely on keynsian disruptions that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
Japan has been awakened in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1% from the growing costs for vehicles, travels and leisure jobs.
The Stigma of Yen
Tokyo has entrusted to the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - flies into one of the "auxiliary currencies" of the investors, who are in the debt crisis of the Eurozone and the devastating forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that loads like a grave stone on the accounts of the export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of large technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony returned their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the Yen.
While markets continue to be camped on the peripheral EU countries, Yoshiko Noda Government remains alert.
"The risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the effects of floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the Yen," said yesterday the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are really not very exciting.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) explained that in September most Member States had shown clearer signs of slowing economic development.
The indicator predicting the turning points of the world economy revealed that the brake had been drawn in the largest economic potential.
Because he fell by four tenths to lose 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is at 100 after it has fallen by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens reappears doubts
Mr Papadimos says that the savings measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement.
With the high risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also deceived in the labyrinth that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is a reaction to the pressure from Brussels rather than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly proved by facts.
During yesterday, the new Prime Minister, Luke Papadimos, pointed out that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundreds of days given during his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and at no time withdraw his demand for new elections at the determined date, 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," insured Papadimos yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will reach its highlight tomorrow with the confidence voting for the new government.
The first initiatives are a package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reforming disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax deduction.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not clear the doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but to nothing else."
The conservative leader went too far with its challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism, which needs to unlock the 8000 million, which are urgently needed by Athens, and made it clear that he would not approve a declaration of commitment on the fulfilment of the savings measures.
But the European Commission, who is still irritated because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday that it was not to ratify its demand: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties would "not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible".
The speaker of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika came back to Athens "about soon" to discuss with the new government, "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section" of EUR 8000 million, although there is no definitive date yet.
The Greek knee has still for a while threads.
Queen Sofía: "These are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of funding
Spain "had reached a dominant position worldwide in the role of smallest funding".
The Queen Sofía of Spain reminded yesterday that in the last two decades, Spain has developed itself as the second donor for this means of international cooperation, which is based on the fact that it is a "Institut for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind on the basis of trust in mankind".
Yesterday the Queen announced the Fifth World Summit on Small Credits in Valladolid. She was convinced that "no doubt" would be that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium targets set by the United Nations until 2015 and "in particular the goal of living with income of less than one dollar per day, i.e. below the "Poverty Limit".
Spain " continues to work" on the extension of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it performs this task responsible," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will take place from the summit to Thursday will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the principal beneficiary of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "resist many challenges."
The summit on smaller credits is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for "two basic objectives".
The Queen explained that it would be sought that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households will exceed the limit of poverty.
In Spain and the rest of the world, the conception of small credits goes back to the way Muhammad Yunus "initiated years ago", which the Queen Sofia considers as a "Action of Justice and Recognition".
The father of this funding instrument described her as a "admirable ideaist who has signed the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet the loan strategy on site.
This experience followed one year later the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings at the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all of us "we have been able to observe a continuous development," the Queen whose commitment to this project yesterday explained her assessment as "family nober head" in Valladolid and as "president of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia completed her speech by animating the attendees to participate in the debate and seeking solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic Commandment"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "a ethical command" for the whole democratic state.
In this sense, it stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid to economic trees, because it was a "continuous commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that the smallest credits were a "reasonable and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty" and that the governments of the industrial states would now "more than ever" have to work according to solidarity criteria and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to be a victim.
For Spain, the smallest credits are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, complained "the success", "marginalised" people, "which are always standing before closed doors" "hopping" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendants in a city that opens "their gates, enclosed by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President due to general vote
The first day of the Christian Democrats' Congress (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig, was born to Angela Merkel, the bureau and president of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not planned in the programme, but has taken place in the autumn, in particular in order to provide enough to those activists who estimate the government policy with regard to Greeks today and possibly in Italy as too lax tomorrow.
The European Commission's proposal for a presidency was almost unanimously adopted.
Among 1001 delegates had only voted nine against, ten had abandoned the vote.
The several minutes ongoing standing Ovation, which was first applied to Angela Merkel, and a few hours later Wolfgang Schueble, had no doubt from the three European ministers of Finance.
The secretary's main idea - as well as the requests - has the following slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "new million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
"The time for a breakthrough in Europe has come for the office."
This could be expressed by an amendment of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries of the Eurozone, strengthening the European Union's control, but this could also be the case in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote to give Europe a face."
However, this is in any case one of the requests adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood Wolfgang Schueble Pate.
Surely it is little likely that the 47 will agree quickly on this revolution: Groβ-Germany is opposed to the matter, and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority have rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of individual economies, evidently a predecession of Germany's position.
Therefore, the bureaucracy concerned with the climate within her party has strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulties that would immediately criticise the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European application for the importance of "German-French friendship" devotes a section, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds me that Leipzig was at the centre of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleon army.
What is the representation of fraud in illness notifications?
After family aid, UMP and government are now attacking the illness notifications.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive on Tuesday, November 15, in Bordeaux, to visit a family aid fund and to present a speech on the issue of fighting against social fraud and economic dependency from the state, which has been repeated since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is due to the effort to undergo the economy in a hard trial, on the other hand, but does not represent a less predecession of the right presidency campaign, the majority want to focus on employee disease notifications.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is advising the introduction of a fourth day of career before taking into account a medical notification of workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the wage of four days, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to provoke anger, but would help bring in 280 million euros.
And the person who was more symbolic in a different measure: admit to the government officials a unpaid carence day in the case of disease (to date there is for them, in contrast to the three carence days in the private sector, no time limit).
While these issues are being discussed, the majority also rebuilds fraud topics, targeting this time the abuse associated with work abuse.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition they will be reimbursed when required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November, from the microphone of the broadcaster RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the fields of illness notifications seem a little unproportionate.
In fact, this has been the subject of permanent monitoring and political opens, which have been most frequently fruited since 2002.
The French are not more frequently sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, first of all, let us stay with the country-wide figures.
According to the CNAM National Hospital Bank, more than 237 million euros were paid daily in 2006.
Community of the Health Research and Documentation Institute represented the day-to-day findings in 2008 with EUR 11.3 billion 5% of health expenditure.
These amounts included 46% of maternity leave and work accidents and 54% of disease leave, which is EUR 6.2 billion.
And then 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, a study by the Alma Consulting Group showed that there were only 14,5 hospital days compared to the 17,8 days in 2009.
A mean that confuses certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, the career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 interviewed, French employees indicated not to have taken a single nurse day.
Another study that this time was recorded by the health insurance shows that 37% of the disease reports were shorter than 8 days in 2010; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared with their European neighbours, the French workers tend to work incapacity no more than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Center for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (sickness or otherwise justified) oscillated in France between 10% and 11% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of illness notifications represents a disappearing small proportion of black work.
As far as it is concerned, there is only a weak exmeasure.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic controls in the case of disease notifications exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public University of Technology and Engineering) found less than 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 of the short-term short-term illness notifications that were called 37,050 cases", were unjustified or too long.
In the systematically controlled cases of disease reporting of more than 45 days, among 1.2 million were 11% of "unjustified or unjustified" cases, which are 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million employees who have claimed a illness notification.
A digit representing only a weak examination against, for example, those of black work.
According to the UMP Member of Dominique Tian, author of a case report published in July on this issue, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily remuneration, and thus significantly more than the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme for the capture of its economy.
On Monday, on 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had announced before Parliament that the government of the Union did not grant a hundred days enough to fulfil this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners as well as a new budgetary adjustment programme," the Head of Government in his first public speech explained in opening the debate on Parliament's confidence vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurotop meeting on 27 October was the "main task" of the new government, since the participation of the country within the Eurozone" was at stake as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the state deficit of the country"in order to reduce the 9%" of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new susceptions
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wrist, had given his consent on Monday with regard to the already approved measures in respect of an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but was sent to predict that his party would not be prepared to obtain additional sparma take-up.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a parliamentary meeting of his Party New Democracy.
He had declared himself prepared with the requirements for reducing budget deficit and debt, as well as for fighting the waste, but any policy was hostile that would undermine the economic growth.
Olli Rehn, with the economic and monetary tasks of the EU Commissioner who had prevented IMF and the EU from releaseing the necessary loan over EUR 8 billion without a written warranty of all parties on their support for the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had answered that his word was sufficient and would not sign anything under pressure from Auβen.
Euthanasia and accompanying free death must be legalised, according to an expert body
Canadians live in denial of death, as a report from the Royal Society of Canada shows
The Board explained that governments, healthcare and doctors cooperated in terms of pain-lining treatment in order to provide the best pain-lining agents, and this also beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a rejection attitude toward death.
Only 9% of the Canadians are actually able to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and take dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report from the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts involved in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government change the criminal law in such a way to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia where this choice takes place, in the case of patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As an optic, experts quote a recently published survey of the independent company EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the earth's ball.
Although Canada has placed on the tenth rank, the study notes that "the medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the topic of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to painstilling agents, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the majority of the Canadians' desire to die at home, however, 68.6% of them die at the hospital at last.
From the whole country, the rate of 86% of deaths in the hospital in Quebec has been the highest.
In the tender question concerning Euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report find conclusions that are against the position of the Federal Government, which has already been inclined to make any changes to the law on Euthania and accompanying suicide.
However, according to the experts who have inspected all the countries whose approach to euthanation and accompanying suicide legalized or decriminalised, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would lead to misuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanation or accompanied suicide of incompetent or unauthorised persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such infringements are addressed just in the countries where Euthania and accompanying suicide are not legalised, as confirmed yesterday Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, at a tele conference.
"Euthanasie is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Selective suicide is also practiced in Canada, although clearly illegally here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadian Advocates Euthana
Congratulations, according to an Angus-Reid survey carried out in 2010, 85% of the Canadians had already been exposed to the benefit of Euthania, as they believe that they allowed people to mitigate their suffering at the end of their life course.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalisation of Euthania does not lead to conveying the message that the life of older or handicapped people has less value.
Regarding those who have already had a accompanied suicide, the respondents believe 41% that they should not be persecuted.
As regards the maintenance or stopping of funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also point out in their recommendation list that it should be stated in the criminal law that the withdrawal of the funds for which a legal rejection has been made should not be considered criminal.
In addition, the expert body calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the end of life's resources and to fear this without criminal persecution.
The Board explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to pain-smerging treatment to provide the best pain-sensitive drugs, and this also beyond the cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the medicines already used in the Canadian institutions for health care, the body calls for pain relief or life-sustaining measures to consider them at least, as they were not used to reduce physical pain and refer to the same procedures as euthanasia.
Precautions for other experts
Some health experts have already provided reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has called the attitude of the report-signing experts as "extrem" among other things, since they have no limits on euthanation practice in the final phase.
"This opens the palaces for a situation in which one who is life-sufficient and older than 18 years old asks another person to be helpful to his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to have the individual's own responsibility over all other values involved in the social sector of society.
But, he says, there are guidelines and obligations in a society.
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she titulated as "Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular doubts the report on the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where Euthania and accompanying suicide are legalised, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls President Assad for the departure of power
Damascus pranges a "complot"
Syria is seen isolated
The Partisans Baschar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Auβen Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Baschar al-Assads, which, however, resists this, thanks to Russia's support and has a "complot" directed against the country, was strengthened yesterday.
Two days before Syria's exclusion by the Arab League, the European Union has intensified its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had taken position in favour of a departure by President Assad.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan yesterday was the official Arab Prime Minister, who had invited President Baschar al-Assad to do so, "to settle his power in Syria", in which the 40 civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"Looking Bashar the interest of his country to the heart, he would depart, but in addition he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the king of Jordan, the neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu had complained that since the beginning of the year the Syrian regime, Turkish intermediary trials had not been crowned by success.
"The ones in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and cannot be satisfied with this must go," he explained in addressing Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a steady rage of attitude.
The United States has, on its own, welcomed the "consensus consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" due to the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, Arab Liga and countries like Turkey, have made an increasingly sharp tone in Syria in view of the repressions," Mark Toner observes, a speaker of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria have died, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, were killed in "science exchanges and heavy bombs around Jobar" in the camped city of Hom.
On the occasion of a press conference, the Syrian Auβenhandelsminister Walid al-Muallim was still of the opinion that the country's taxes on the end of the crisis'.
By the way, he responded with emphasis on the decision of the Arab Liga to suspend Damascus from his tasks, which represents his assessment after a "hazardous step".
Syria "does not give up," he added during the prayer, "the complots that were smote against Syria would fail."
According to the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, the media and military observers to the country.
The French Auβenhandelsminister Alain Juppé had also spoken in favour of the broadcasting of UN observers in order to protect civilians from repressions of the regime that he has incorporated into his "Paranoia".
A new meeting of the League is planned for tomorrow in Rabat in order to discuss the implementation of the plan adopted on 2 November on the emergence of the crisis, but in particular the controversial, predicted withdrawal of the military troops from the camped cities and the release of imprisoned demonstrators.
The Russian Auβenminister Sergej Lawrow classed the decision of the Arab League as "incorrect" yesterday in order to guard against the punishment of possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already admonished Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets for patience and Italy to be prepared to offer
Mario Monti, the future Italian Head of Government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and to implement a programme that requires "offers" to recover the creditworthiness lost in the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former Commissioner of the European Union held an negotiation with the political parties yesterday before the present meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his duty to call up a cabinet in Parliament, composed relatively strictly of external technocrates.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of a number of smaller parliamentary groups participating in the discussions after meeting with the President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Members, had been waiting for Mario Monti to give Parliament a voice of confidence until Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will take place in the presentation presented by M. Monti of a list of cancellations, which will undoubtedly reach from a dozen of ministers to the Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday the nervosity of the stock exchange and bond markets demanded their time.
In "a democracy there are certain deadlines", in order to prepare a government as well as a government programme, he stressed that it is "safe that markets will show themselves duly and discreet".
His order by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the disturbance was reinforced, especially after an unexpected industrial production decrease in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister of Officers was to establish a staff consisting mainly of Technocrats, although he had stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Members, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence certificate until Friday.
M. Monti has undertaken to work in the sense of the objective of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A speaker of EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "once our diagnosis towards the Italian economy is not changing even taking into account the new government".
The EU, who is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary compensation in 2013, despite the savings plans taken in these last months, has in particular applied for new take-offs.
Emma Marcegalia, "Chefin of the Heads" of Italy, which will meet on Tuesday at Monti, also relies on the need for economic reinforcement", because a country that has no growth has to show that deficit numbers cannot respect."
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as a EU Commissioner (1994-2004), represents an "epoken change" of Italy after 17 years"Berlusconism"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "experience of trust" as well as a "other Italy", the lead article authors.
The largest unknown is the long-life of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferential elections, since Italy has now arrived for EUR 200 billion State bonds until April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran's nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a bombing capsule used with a nuclear weapon, so confirmed on Monday an American NGO specialized in nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Nuclear Safety AIEA as well as other documents from this UN Agency to identify this scientist.
The AIEA had announced last week its "reasonable concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the detailed study of the AIEA documents since ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Tscheljabinsk (Ural) for over three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was supposed to have left the centre to establish a company in Kiev that creates "Nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In their last report, the AIEA's strong indication that the Iranian development" of a nuclear bombing system" was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only migrant in this technology but also, as a state member of the Agency informed, his entire professional career has worked on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy programme of its country of origin."
Anti-Islamian crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
The crimes and crimes targeted against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday, have either decreased slightly or slightly.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims was increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, thus by 49%, while an increase of 13% in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in criminal offences targeted against Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hass-motivated crimes" increased to 6.628 cases in very weak Maβe, including 47.3% due to race differences and 20% by religious differences in criminal offences, says the FBI.
"After a deterioration in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the Human Rights First stressed.The increase in anti-Islam violence is particularly significant," the organisation added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hatred crimes, should be considered to be a serious legal disadvantage against human rights," added Paul Legendre, a organisational manager.
"The American Government can and should do more to combat these crimes," he added that this could be done with a better police attitude toward "hascrime".
The "hass crime" represents the inheritance of the American Federal Law from the era of the fight for civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violence against race, skin color, religion or descendance and now also involve sexual offences.
Twitter walks the platform and is increasingly similar to Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday to enable its users, in particular, to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to those of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and a different "Name" enables better readable live follow-up of other "Twitters" activities, the Internet users, their news ("Tweets") are persecuted and your messages are tracked.
This enables them to find out whether they allow to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favour certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday"in August at a small percentage of users", the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner declared before the French Press Agency AFP.
Twitter was known for his little instinctive functioning, coated with something esotherical encouraging words (RT for referencing repetition of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre and autre utiliateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
Users discussed this innovation on the network with the help of certain "Tweets".
"This is unnecessary, urgency and equal to too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function "activity" will help me to better track certain elements of my flux twitters," verifiable @dannykron current.
Austria
Inclusion of a Golden Budget Rule in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden budget rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any degradation from rating agencies in Austria's top Bonity (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Officer Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although Austria's public debt is 74.6%, which is far above the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payment capabilities were not lowered on a hit from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros additional every year," said Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Cancers and Christian Democratic Minister of Auβen.
Austria also claims the Brussels Summit of Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government would then have required the inclusion of public deficits by the end of 2012 and the return to the public account balance into the Constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian Government is similar to the 'German model', since Germany had been the first European country which had included such a 'regel' in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP) every year, from 2017 the structural deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% GDP limit, while the regional and municipality budgets should be balanced.
The aim is to eliminate budget debts under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Agreement in the Horizon 2020/21.
Starker Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on monetary markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that if the Yen should continue to rise, the Japanese official force would re-intervene on the currency markets.
"If we would find an excessive volatility" in the yen exchange course, we will intervene as we did the last time," explained M. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the Yen was close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
This day, Tokyo had sold massive yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese currency value, which has been in order to control a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the Yen has regularly risen over it by purchases by investors, which regard the Yen as "availability value" in these uncertain times of world economic decline and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell on Tuesday under 77 Yen, the euro was switched under the symbolic late of 105 Yen near the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 Yen, the euro over 160 Yen.
This strait fire of the Japanese devisor harms the exports of the Archipel, as it consumes the costs of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake as well as the Tsunami, which destroyed the region of Tohoku (North-East), for its reconstruction," stresses M. Noda, who fears that this delight of Yen could kill the weak upturn already in the cam.
The third economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time this year thanks to the enormous increase in exports and the consumption of "plumbed" households.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the value of the Yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
Minister of Finance Jun Azumi invited the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee on Tuesday, to take all thoughtful steps to eliminate the Yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, Vice-President of the Institute, has noted that the BoJ has already initiated "approved measures", which makes it acceptable that no additional currency locking can be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the Bank of Noten had increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion Yen (47 billion euros) to cover the 55.000 billion Yen (519 billion euro) that it had used for various purchases of financial titles to overflow the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest feet fast up to the height, exchanges make retractors
The risk of infecting the debt crisis is constantly undermining European numbers.
Despite the office of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to increase.
The stock exchanges still concerned about the stability of the Eurozone also operate on Tuesday, on 15 November, a little more in negative cases.
In Paris CAC lost 1.4% at 10 p.m. and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions relating to the return on government bonds in the Eurozone in difficulty, the global share markets continue to spend some of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, institutional Broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters Press Agency.
The stock exchanges in Tokyo, which, on the one hand, suffered from the new fear of market participants regarding the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continued, had closed with a baisse of 0.7%.
"Japan has focused on Europe as well as on the rest of the world, and trade moves to a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," assuming Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Invest Management.
This resurrection of concerns about the future of the Eurozone harms the single currency that continues its baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 o'clock the European currency was worth $1.3570, so it gave up by 0.4%.
According to the stock exchange makers, she went back after the CDU, the party of Kanzler Angela Merkel, who had gathered at the Congress on Monday, had made an application which, in particular, provides for the possibility of disadvantaged countries to withdraw from the Eurozone without simultaneously leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
The loan interest rates of Italy and Spain remain at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning the yield of the Italian bonds reached 6.85% to 10 years, the Spanish title was matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to give rise to the fears of investors.
The future Italian Head of Government Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had, on his part, confirmed that the implementation of the decision of the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was the main task of its government.
Spain is located in the view of the markets, since Parliament's elections will take place in the country on Sunday.
However, the "spread" of interest between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once reached a new historical elevation.
Expected growth rates of the eurozone
Statistically, France accounted for a economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the INSEE statistical Federal Office had revised the bases of the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter that worries the economic experts most.
Germany had a 0.5% growth over the same period.
A first settlement of the whole Eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., warning the EU Commission against the risk of re-recession.
Energy policy:
Features should win about dogma
If there is a subject that cannot be addressed on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, this is definitely the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take a election meeting to consider this topic and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it distorts the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution drives a double of electricity demand by 2050, a huge proportion of the world population should not be abandoned from a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to facilitate the deficit of fossil resources in order to continue to produce continuously electricity without the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic disappeared from the ecological debate in order to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to remain isolated in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to its decision to finding a replacement source, or in Switzerland, which is just intentional to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, in order to mention only a few countries, their projects continue to pursue with determination.
The United States, on its own, decided to join their park by re-operating the work Three Mile Island after the nuclear accident.
Although the renewable energy sources, the German model is sometimes set as an example, then the reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will be made in the form of a revalidation of the electricity price, an energetic dependency, particularly from Russia, will result in an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The total of these unpleasant effects will be noticeable within few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is a European table leader with regard to wind energy, of which it relates to 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternatingly used with wind energy; therefore its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the persistentness of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill, as opposed to our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy plays a key role in competitiveness and a pound of industrial stability on national grounds, the French companies have a benefit due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Therefore, any significant reduction in nuclear power would result in a strong increase in the energy price, which will read the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defense of the purchasing power to illusion.
Surveillance showed that this is a price that the large majority of the French are willing to pay as low as it shows resistance to the principle of this source of energy.
Contrary to the fact that our country's energy policy has enabled us to build an industrial branch with 125.00 direct and 410.000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a variety of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them to creators of countless jobs.
If France took the decision to eliminate nuclear power, then a large proportion of these SMEs would be victimed and the annual 6 billion euros of investment goods and nuclear energy exports would grow increasingly.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years if the decline of its producer was preprogrammed?
In order to solve the energy equation, you must admit that there is just as little a devil's work a miracle for the generation of electricity.
The solutions developed by the company Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority carrying out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as construction in Flamanville.
Their working teams, who have been named due to their professionality, are just to be possessed by the security presentation.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disturbances.
Only one one, which is in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions, so he did without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Tschernobyl, the drama was raised by reactor design as well as infinite human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused outbreaks that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its teachings from this accident as it had done after the two previous ones.
As the fruit of this approach, as well as the cooperation of the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft which enables it to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fantastic gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading them free trains to travel the lead position in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to have emotions, dogmas and party men dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration burden or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "Land of Human Rights", as France himself described.
Recently, the disturbance against foreign students from the administrative side had marked the week views, which the minister of the Interior had accompanyed (see Libération of 23 May), that France "no talent, Maure or Kellner needed from abroad".
But this policy was rarely analyzed from a economic point of view.
Indeed, there is a broad consensus between the right and the left.
On the right hand, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, would not pose a problem for a country", from the left hand side of Michel Rocard, who presented in 1990, "can not take up the whole poverty of the world."
The only difference is the degree of greasiness.
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish clampers was divided from both right and left in 2005.
From both camps the immigrants were considered as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the degree of greedyness that is willing to admit to the immigrants.
Francois Hollande is limited in his programme to banalities, which point to allow partnership development to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections, but it is economically expensive.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron reflect us in a recently appeared work that summarises the latest knowledge about immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a wide consensus among the specialists with regard to the positive influence of immigrant flows on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Restriction of immigration would eliminate growth and harm the situation in the labour market.
The fears of the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute local workers, especially the less qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that the immigrants are much more complementary than the local wage workers, since they are exercising heavy-point professionals in sectors that are unexploited in jobs.
The low-qualified immigrants are working in sectors where local employees are low, the more qualified among immigrants are working in dynamic sectors where training is not similar to the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Similarly, as a surgeon would have difficulties working in a country in which there is a lack of anaesthesists, this complementarity also creates a positive effect of immigrant access to wages and national labour market situations.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the immigration flow leads to an inclusive long-term increase of the real equine between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of idea creation and economic growth introduced by immigrants is acceptable (high proportion of resident immigrants among American Nobel Prize Authors; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute net to the social systems, in the average European countries at about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Employment Organisation estimates that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 is averaged to make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) to the public budget over its lifetime of approximately EUR 150 000.
At the end of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring the missing cutting points "with the teeth".
However, these dentists, which were to scare the immigrants, achieved precisely the counterpartial effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to recall itself who, after their invention in Athens, had experienced the entire 20th century of the tragicities of the first world war, totalitarism, Holocaust, Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Colonel in Greece.
Some believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote in the most direct way possible to see democracy overcome their enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon"the little," that it was a characteristic of mental attitude.
The general right of election, which is a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient for this and can be as well as a "suppression instrument" as the Republican philosopher Etienne vacherot then expressed.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation and control of violence, training, education, economic and social spirit, a judicial approach.
The crisis in Europe in which we are present is an economic crisis, but it is as much as it is, first and foremost, the political and democratic crisis.
The change in the mind of the Greek True-Falsch referendum would have been duplicate in this respect: once the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of their inability, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered excessive.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer aim in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to press on a success of the national referendum, which has been organised depending on the needs and in the wrong order.
A free sign for the European sole ruler or a jump with related eyes into the emptyness of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizens!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, with full right, cleared and steady, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you are no longer aware of where to end the list - because there is only one crise, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole Europe that bows to the dictatorship of the markets and the rating agencies, suffering from its disabilities and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe, which is humiliated at international level.
There is anxiety about the transfer of sovereignty toward Europe - it is all of Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus every one of the nations joined it.
The urgency is to return the leadership of the European project to the people's sovereignty.
Because it is at all whether the Europeans can reduce the burden on their debts, free themselves from the markets and move a future through investment.
The rise from the crisis has decisions at European level which cannot be taken without total democratic legal power, without surely bringing us into ruin.
After this proposal has been overwhelmed by Jacques Delors and the socialists for a long time, everyone today urges European economic management to do so.
I agree.
But this would be a new foolishness and another saccharose, without political integration and stronger democracy - as it sweats to the citizens.
We must take a new stage of European construction.
In order to cause the Republic to arise in France, it was necessary to "create Republicans".
The revolution of interests alone could not be sufficient here.
This education remains valid.
We need to form a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become general
The World Fair for Chip Cards opens their gates on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic attitude.
The year 2011, according to Eurosmart, should actually end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone) with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most wearing segment is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or compensation of purchases by simply keeping the map on a reader.
Against the 320 million sold one year before this year, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide!
Their market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and over 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins with regard to the non-contact payment on soil, after it has long been dependent on the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400.000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
However, consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary that the banks provide their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to systematically delivering their customers banking cards that are fitted with contactless chips in the future," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Test banks Payment by phone
However, this is only one first stage on the way to the payment fund of the future: the mobile phone.
A disappearing low percentage of devices has so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology (Near Field Communication) necessary for the execution of these transactions.
"They're in a delay."
"But they should experience a real upward development at least next year."
"We expect to sell from 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test race in Caen, which will run from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are intended to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also said yesterday to prepare the market introduction of an offer that allows their customers to pay free of contact by phone.
Terrorist front understands, from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram Sect.
The already suspected relationships between the al-Qaida group of terrorists in Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sekte Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Auβen Minister Abdelram Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now gained "security about it".
"The way in which both organisations act and the relations of the secret services indicate a clear cooperation," he said without continuing to go into detail.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The surveys on the kidnapping of two franchises in the Niger took place in January last year have promoted interfaces.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, which were killed in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi's adherents, should have been killed on the following days at the same time as several of their kidnappers at the time of a surgery carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists at the site of use.
Terrorist axis
Analysis of the telephone calls conducted leads to several conversation partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two conversation partners: A number leads to a Nigerian who has long been in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, who had stayed the weigh of Boko Haram, and the other leads to a man who is close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but you must no doubt wait for clearer evidence before you can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's possible, however."
"You have been aware for years that the secrecy is related to financial and intellectual support of Auβen and that it is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo humiliates.
In these last months, these "support services" have become more and more open in their course, as well as the speeches and operation modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate that suicide assassinators are attracted and the use of ever more complex explosives, which carry the same manuscript as those used by Aqmi.
Since that time, the International Community has exercised pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have considered the grouping of illuminates for a long time, which must not be given special attention.
Fast success
The Boko Haram, founded in Maiduguri in the area of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which means in Haoussa as much as "the western education is a shame" - is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the north of the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this moderate region, the merger experiences rapid success.
She politics itself and demands strict compliance with Shariah, while the activists joined her in fighting the wicked central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the vision.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their increased attacks on the Commissioners.
However, the reaction of Abuja is as usually indicated.
The army surrounds the city, it counts 800 dead.
The Mohammed Yusuf in prison is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes more radical and leaves its high-burgers in the north.
Last Christmas she known to be an attentive in Jos, which demanded 80 human lives, then to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide assassination that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his type.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations is a priority international target disc.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is intended to lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, has been concerned with all security experts since then.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger occupied the Somalians of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned and was willing to communicate all the instructions at the time of a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria."
The world of the Republican presidency candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and ignorance regarding China, Iraq and the support for Israel.
Can a crisis weakened America have a complex world with simple ones, not to say: lead a multiplicity of ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like this, the voters could get almost this impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their fellow fighters have repeatedly made their thundering statements as well as their statements on Auβen policy, traditional Republican focus.
Through China, Iran and Israel's help - often in no way supported - are falling a struggle.
With regard to the designation of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest level in the course, the Chinese threatened to quote before the WTO and to blame it for the "valuation manipulation" - leading topic in an America that is most irritated by the migration of all industry branches to Asia.
He said that if this is to impose a trade war, it was stupid.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and only candidate, who seems to have a mature vision of Auβen politics, has almost cut off the air with regard to his emotions-smilling spring.
He had called for a hand-fast but constructive exchange of conversations with Beijing (even the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not answered because he is staggered in the depths of the question of opinion.
Reagan's illustration
Romney had also praised military struggles against Iran if the sanctions for stopping the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I'm chosen, I'm ordering a stop to Iran," he told.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel strengthened military assistance and accused Obama to remain guilty of this partner's obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, secondly placed candidate, has a shameful record injury.
He recently called on to give the Chinese military threat contra, since Beijing's attempt to develop a nuclear power' - and seemed to be aware of the fact that China has already been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military struggle against Iran, is willing to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The reception of folterma arrests against mutabestic terrorists by Obama 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and the Candidation Michele Bachmann.
It is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auβenpolitical gravity.
The current Presidentship contradictors, Reagan also had simple ideas and despite all the cold war.
They recall that Obama was also an amateur and had to give water into his wine, which was the subject of antiterror.
They rightly persist on the failure of his naive negotiation with Iran, the preliminary withdrawal of his "Jung" from Iraq, his unconsciousness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
However, this enthusiasm is not so obsessed.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance sheet of national security under Obama, which has disabled Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been guarding against military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama is more amazed by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to raise his leadership position to new life.
Nord Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the eastern sea ground and connects the western Europe directly to Russia, was set into operation.
It is intended to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to do this event with glance and Gloria.
Over 500 loaded guests, including four Heads of State and Government, have attended the last Tuesday at the Eastern Sea Coast under orchestra clocking and in the Feinschmuckbuffet the dedication of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which is directly connected to Russia and Germany under sea level.
The German Kanzler Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, have symbolically turned the tax of the valve, which transports the Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline aims to deliver 27,5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year through a first pipeline of 1.224 km long, which connects the Sankt Petersburg region to Mecklenburg-Vorpommers to Western Europe.
A second pipeline allowing a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of French total consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And you are already leaving the eventuality of the construction of a third line on your own route.
For Gazprom, the time-to-time and point-accurate completion of this huge building acts as a victory.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream pipeline will enable direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any tramways through third countries (Polen or Ukraine).
For this reason, these two countries lose a little of their power: for them it will become more difficult to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was not reversed to compare the North Stream Pipeline with a "new German-Soviet Pact" in connection with the Hitler-Stalin bond for the purpose of Poland's occupation in 1939.
This means that the topic is politically too sensitive.
West Europe has gained even more security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the cost of decovering European energy, since the project has struck a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, with strong gas consumption and their gas incidents, in almost five years.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically", confirmed François Fillon in the dedication of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what degree the large gas contracts are also of political and economic importance.
All of this explains the wide smile of the gazprom manager represented in Lubmin with regard to the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique.
The subwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete coating to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea ground, in about 200 metres depth.
During her construction, mine fields dating from the Second World War had to be eliminated.
"Round hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed precautionously," said Jens Müller, speaker of the Nord Stream Society.
In addition, increased measures were needed to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long hose of metal, heavy like 242 eiffel towers that have been interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valve or maintenance stations.
A control platform was intended before the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have taken away from it, as Sweden had little insisted on seeing a Russian state society permanently at its coastal level.
"In the case of a havary, we close the gas throughlet in less than one minute," Jens Müller clarified.
So in the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline is disappeared into the air.
However, this case is considered by the constructors as very little likely, as the sweats were estimated to be resistant to a leak per 100.000 years.
The State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured by both a underwater robot that is controlled for external observation purposes by a sea ship, as well as by an equipment circulated inside the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, measured a metre diameter, is imported into the inside of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of forward movement through the steering at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on any deformations of the metal at its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without having to be subject to the least repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have united their powers in order to achieve this project.
However, the management remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
In addition, the German companies E. ON and BASF are joined (each to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch gas union and the French company group GDF Suez (each to 9%).
These five companies have established a company named Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
She has its seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then hired the entire capacity of its gas transport, on a prolongable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of how large the actual transporter's amount of gas falls out," clarified Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured at 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total work costs should be EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the sum of investments was 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are sure to recover their debts, since Gazprom alone has the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline takes place on a sandy, forested coastline near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4,5 meters high valves form the gas exit sprays.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other identification numbers of the incoming gas before it is transmitted to the German gas pipelines.
Since the last Tuesday, this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
From a Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give a new style to the writing.
It has a flair of adventure, spent hours on candles with the writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular entrance, its rubber band, the ovarian sides, as aged over time.
However, the Moleskine Notebook, as you know it today, has been created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its seat in Milan, decided to bring a distinguished design notebook to the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then the company's expert adviser, is responsible for the introduction of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an old-fashioned production technique called Mole Skin (maulwurfshaut), which is called a cotton lacquer, for example used for polstered benches.
This type of notebook was very asked among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has resurrected an old and almost forgotten object that was considered the icon of avantgardist artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now trademark managers at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rise by 26% and set up by 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine happens to the Italian border and is exported in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom picture of the buyers, as the notebook enthusiasms as well as students and experts.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitical, cultivated and open spirit customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginning, now employs more than 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in book stories, on web portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and is aware of its identity.
"We have followed the time spirit and its new writing needs, which exists despite the e-mail recovery," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of the moleskine company: Recently, the brand launched an exposition called "Detour (omweg)" in which architects and artists issued their own notebooks.
In August, the company also marketed a link with leopard patterns at the time of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural time spirit and understood it to diversify its products: bags, appointment calendar, filler, computer shields... The brand shows the entire bandwidth of articles.
A success that envys the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, the present Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine company.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of the disabled persons are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a deliberate public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in disabled persons is always twice as high as the average average: 19% versus 9% unemployment of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, so emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, which declares the "week of work for disabled people".
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"Then the unemployment rate was not double, but three times so high."
"Nothing still remains enormous much to do."
However, it must be said that for disabled unemployed workers there are still many obstacles before they get a job.
The elderly are more common: 37% are older than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a low grade of qualification: 80% of them have no abitur and there are only 10,000 people with disabilities among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% in disabled persons compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that are difficult to re-employ and which are "the core of the problem," said Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a 1992-based association that helps companies to recruit employed persons with disabilities.
So much to the fair brakes.
Continue the unexplained, the spirit attitudes, which, though sure, develop themselves, but slowly.
A study conducted in April by the Association of IMS-Entrepreneurs for the magazine La Cité indicated that the consulted managers have "a weak level of knowledge regarding disabled people", which is "overrepresented" by "persons in wheelchairs, psychically or intellectually less-between".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees have a far-reaching way to achieve the employment goal of 6% disabled workers, which was laid down in a 1987 law.
These latter figures from 2008 refer to a quota of 2.6%.
"We are now at about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organisation who is responsible for making contributions from companies who disregard this law.
Proof: The number of "payers payable" holdings have reduced from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, explained Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses a real knowledge in particular in the large business groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the firms between 20 and 49 employees employed, but companies with 100 to 199 employees 82%.
Hazard: "What a happiness"
Even before they offered the "Blue ministers (20:45 p.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasure that brought them the game of friendship.
It would have been too far to claim that there was a secret consent between them, but the picture speaks symbolic bands.
On the side of the audience podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have been able to close peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had harvested nothing but praise regarding his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assured the boring liller on his side.
As regards the contrast between its representation in club and national elf, "It is a unit that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille throughout the year, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought up Friday evening against Romania with regard to the match against France, in order to finally "glimb".
However, without abstaining from the note of "need".
The French national team has fired him since the age of 7 years, leading his victorious fields between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalled.
"We just walked over the way."
"Because they are allowed to play means great happiness!"
Leekens read with kindness "Stolz" on his hand.
"The pride, a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his quality as "Nachbarn" - that France" again has become a team at a very high level", and that is a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done fucking good work," he said excitedly.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European championship, the engineer is very likely to see the plane share with the Blue (France National Elf) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out growingly," he stressed.
"We are planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will notice that in the forthcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward to this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.).
During play, two teams had missed the reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and especially a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no doubt that "La Selecçao", his national elf, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship in 2012.
For Portugal, this in fact means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play and defend a opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the party over more than an hour clearly, but the team was not able to press the matter on the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from it.
"This is a good result, however, which presents a certain risk, since we have not reached an outward gate."
At home, however, in their brightly exhibiting towns de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to strike themselves in front of a audience, which is likely to be similarly hot on the game, even if the party was announced, of course, as "very little," the optimistic but clear Bento said.
"We expect a very little match, but we are fully convinced that we can win the upper hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance to be present in the Championship of Europe in 2012," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz was relative.
The disagreement on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a gate.
A disagreement can already satisfy the Bosnians who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, however, that presents a certain risk, since we have not reached an outward gate," regrets Bento.
"We will fight a team that has high technical quality and has players with many individual qualitys," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese were planning to exercise maximum pressure on the Bosnians at first to "do not give them time to think."
A good idea, subject to the fact that it is implemented this time.
