Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they will be ‘compared to Muppets’
A proposal that would change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of the plans to amend the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name will be ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘great on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poep.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is ‘dissatisfaction’ and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party stands open for the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context the Welshe letter W is expressed as a short you.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, currently working on the drafting of legislation to implement the change of name, said: ‘Of course, it are the members of the National Assembly of Wales itself who take the final decision on their new title.’
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the members of the Wales National Assembly were entitled to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be re-baptized to Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but MWP option was most supported in public consultation.
At present, members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will find it difficult to reach a consensus.
The legislation on reforms also includes other amendments to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will definitely be able to vote on their new title when they debate legislation.
Inhabitants of Macedonia vote in a referendum amending the name of their country
On Sunday, choosers vote whether they want to change the name of their country in ‘Republic of North Macedonia’.
The popular referendum was organised in an attempt to resolve a arbitrary dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province named Macedonia.
Athens long claims that the name of his northern neighborhood means that the country would claim in its territory and has repeatedly objected to applications from Macedonia to become a member of the EU and the NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the national consultation on the change of name, said that he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, representatives of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that the name change is just the price to be paid to be a member of the EU and the NATO.
The clocks of Saint Martin's silence, Harlem's hard to do
“The older people with whom I spoke said that here was a café and a church at every corner before,” said Mr Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church to detect."
He said it's understandable that cafes are gone.
He said: “Men have a different social contact now.”
‘Cafés are no longer the residential room of the district, where people regularly walk.’
However, he is concerned that the yields of the sales of the assets of the churches will be less long if the leaders are expecting, ‘and early or left them back at the beginning.’
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people would live that would not help in the remaining refuge places of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to the close of these churches even faster, because it is unlikely that those who move to these apartments will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were ever built by a white church congregation before Harlem became a black metropool: the metropool community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white methodists left in the 1930s.
A black church congregation from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation under the lead of Eerwert John Howard Johnson, who led a boycot from the shopmakers in 125th Street, an important shop street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parochians of Eerwert Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beard.
Dear David Johnson, the son of Eerwaarde Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, called the abomination pride “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the conspiracy in July referred in another way to the instrument: 'an cultural treasure' and 'an indispensable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first scarlet in the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger scourge of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some hired by the church lecture leaders, others by the bisdom.
The constituency (the governing body of the parish, composed of league leaders) wrote the Bishop in July to express its concern that the bisdom would ‘will carry over the costs’ to the constituent, although the constituent had not been involved in hiring the architects and dealers who sent the bisdom.
Some parishes complained about the lack of transparency of the bisdom.
Hai wounds 13-year-old who came to crowns in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who came into California for lobsters. The boy was injured, so it sounds.
The attack took place just 7 hours in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had gone some half an hour with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others, he peddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy cried because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized ‘ that the boy cried, ‘ I was prayed!
I'm prayed!
His key legs were completely open,' saw Hammel when he approached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone had to go out of the water, “There is a shark in the water!”
The boy was brought with a helicopter to the Rady kids' hospital in San Diego, where he is supposed to be in life danger.
It is not conscious of the type of shark responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Giles told at a press conference that a few weeks before a shark was ridiculed nearby, but that then it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim was seriously wounded to the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles noted that more than 135 sharks live in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wish to break on the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is contesting with Boots, Super Drugs and Debenhams and directs beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in large-scale warehouses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, worth £ 2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household articles continues to fall. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 stores throughout the country. If they prove to be successful, they are introduced into more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also due to the fact that supermarkets want to fill the series where TVs, microwaves and interior articles were ever in place with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3000 products, including for the first time marking Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing gamma of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gets more space, with table per brand, such as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up again on the market, now most products are suitable for veganists, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, parfumerie the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first is previously opened in Croydon, south of London, the second will be opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
Since more and more people shop online and every day buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more efforts to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like large warehouses, now the supermarket chain takes it up against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have resulted in more profitability.
The last time the supermarket tried to give his departments Beauty and Apothec a make-over, it became a flap.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended when there was a conflict about the distribution of income from the pharmacy department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmaceutical departments in the shops three years ago for a sum of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan by adding an extended gamma of luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: “We have completely changed the establishment of our beauty department, so this is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialised training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands, we offer for every will, and thanks to the attractive environment and the handy locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones 'worn' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'worn' because TV representative Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is once compared with the mark Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presentator of this morning announced that she was leaving at Instagram.
Peter Jones from Dragons Den is a rage on Holly Willoughby, because she has recently withdrawn from her profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘worn’ when Willoughby was Tuesday during a difficult meeting in the main office of the company in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that by her new contracts (with a value of almost half million pounds) she did not keep enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company is once compared with the Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow brand and expected to double Willoughby's fortune of estimated 11 million pounds.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced that she would leave Truly, Jones left one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was fabulous when she decided to withdraw herself.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned for soon.
The caravan of the main settlement in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrice, one of the most profitable stars in Great Britain, could cost the company millions, as a result of the large investment in products from kisses and candles to clothing and homewear, and as the launch could now increase further delays.
And that could mean the end of a year's friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been well friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, became the company's president in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a share of 40 percent in the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British broadcaster ITV.
A source from the entourage of Jones said yesterday evening: “We have no comment on his business affairs.”
Hard language “and then the love was between us”
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for a comment that he made that some people would find 'inappropriate for a president' and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
"I haven't given up anything."
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in Singapore in June a great step towards the decommissioning of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been held.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea did not see a ‘conform response’ by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
Meanwhile, the United States continues with its penalties to keep pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election ritual.
"We are doing very well in North Korea," he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results. The missile tests have been completed, hostages have been liberated and the material surpluses of American military forces have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave as a president, but instead of 100,000 people trying to get access to this busy arena, about 200 people would stand here,” said Trump, while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, falling hundreds of deaths
In the afterlife of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the Lombok population had no more dwelling, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for international aid.
'In many cases it is clear that they do not apply for international aid, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children are compiling a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure if the providers from abroad can work locally.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disasters Assistance Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still working on evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still very badly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to hide at tsunami's, but along other coasts you can see these rarely.
That there was no warning cirene for tsunamis in Palu, even if a warning was in force, has probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Also, in ideal circumstances it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to the other.
National disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship in Lombok is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship has reached the place of the disaster.
The improvement of the harvestless infrastructure of Indonesia was one of the core points of the election campaign by President Joko Widodo, and he has already spent abundantly much money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko has a lack of funding, and that while he hopes to be reselected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands had to leave their dwelling because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting on the street, with makeets, arrows, and bows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool provides impressive equalisers against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge preserved Liverpool last Saturday for loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a target in the 89th minute, during a match in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood on a distance of about 30 meters from the goal of Chelsea, at the time his team was 1-0 behind.
He tied left against the ball and then shot in the direction of the farst stake.
The ball flew high above the punishment area, towards the right upper corner of the net.
He disappeared the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much as possible,” said Sturridge against LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Cante approach and dare a try. I wasn’t really thinking about it, I just shot on the ball.”
Chelsea stood at the rest with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The top of The Blues shot the ball with his hill to Mateo Kovacic, and then he speeded through the centre to the play half of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick one-tweet in the centre.
Afterward, he gave a beautiful pace, making Hazard able to reach the punishment area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and shot the ball with his left foot beyond Alisson Becker from Liverpool in the net, next to the backstone.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 15 o'clock in the group phase of the Champions League against Napoli, in the Stadio San Paolo in Napels, Italy.
Chelsea takes Thursday at 15 p.m. in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europe League.
The number of deaths of tsunami in Indonesia is up to 832
The number of deaths of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832, said the Agency for Aids in National Disasters Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the ruin of buildings that had been crashed as a result of the earthquake with a power of 7.5 of the previous Friday, with also waves of 6 m high, said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 3800,000 people live, is filled with ruins of collapsed buildings.

Cromwell's stand-up to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-rel
The ban on the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic puritean followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr. Crick as 'foolish' and 'a attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to showing the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses or Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful picture of Cromwell, made by Sir William Thorneycroft, testifies the opinion that was dominated in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many, still needs to be recognized.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Or that is a perfectly correct representation, there is still a debate on this.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognisable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and recognised."
Murderful Whose Kill Kill Killed Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in the southwest of China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the surname ‘Yuan’ is known, was found dead at a stable on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His artery was surrounded and he sat under blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the vaccination of pigs at a pig steel, on 30 May 2005, in Xining in the Province of Qinghai, China.
He was supposed to have traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and showed a door to a neighbouring pig stack open.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood was on his mouth in the pig shock.
A forensic investigation showed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeded and blended,” said the cousin with the surname “Wu”, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
Images of surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived on the market on Thursday at 4.40 o'clock to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that the man killed wasn't of Yuan or his cousin.
A market officer told the Evening News that the pig was locked to prevent others from attacking, while the police collected evidence on site.
Accordingly, the family of Yuan and the market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for his death.
It happens rarely, but there have already been cases of pigs attacking people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, making the man seriously hurt.
Ten years earlier, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife left the animal.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba witnessed at CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression can eliminate.
“They're just plays.
They're just kids, very curious, they're not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The tail of the orca Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the US
As foretold, Orcaan Rosa weakens now that she has reached the cooler waters of the North Coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rain in the coming days to the north of Mexico and southwest.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was an orchestra of category 1, and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, on Sunday morning.
Rosa's going to rise to the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trog begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, which moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical moisture is pushed northward, to the southwest of the USA.
Rosa will bring 10 inches rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that responds with the approaching trog will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, ruins and potential earth shifts in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to downturn from 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected to be 5 to 10 cm rain in parts of the southwest, especially above the largest part of Arizona.
Suddenly there are floods possible with rapidly deterioration, because tropical rain can fall very widely.
It is strongly advised to enter the desert at foot when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into devastating rivers, and the storm will produce local windflakes and dust.
The approaching troop brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the coastal line of South California.
There is rain of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small ruin flows and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rain season.
Dispersed tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday evening to Monday night, and the rain on Monday at the end of the day and Tuesday will spread more.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the U.S. can vary strongly because the North Pole becomes cooler, but the tropes remain quite hot.
This sometimes leads to major differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the ongoing summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the middle and east of the U.S., it was expected that October would begin warm, with temperatures everywhere swimming around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can be 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the probability is high until mid-October at upper average temperatures in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people looked at the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people looked at one of the six television networks on Thursday for the fascinating witness of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault that was reported to take place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasts interrupted the regular programming for the surprise of Friday: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, senator of Arizona, was to examine the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senates Committee on Justice that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was hurting her and tried to pull her clothes out at a high school festival.
Kavanaugh declared in a splendid testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have looked at on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no figures available immediately for the other networks which sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in a office.
Comparison: that is about like a play-off of a football game or for the Oscarout.
Fox News Channel, which gives all support to the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: average 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican declared that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning that protesters screamed to him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing from the Commission for Justice.
He kept standing a few minutes with a beaten eyes while he was embarrassed, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here," said one woman.
“Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone cried, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had made a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various transmitters sinned everything lively when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour of this understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominated next week, something that the minority Democrats demand.
Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, senator and Democrat.
Flake took his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critic of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May politicians criticized her plans to leave the European Union of 'a political game' with the future of Great Britain and to undermine national interests.
Premier of Great Britain Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit. He said that her proposal that Great Britain and the EU should enter each other’s taxes was ‘absurd’.
Shooting Party Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson as a suspicious of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketballer at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and in prison on suspicion of death, said the Baton Rouge police.
The authorities produced a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses in the place of crime and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reported WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had known that Wayde had shot down with death.
His deposit is fixed at $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The body viewer of the East Baton Rouge municipality published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a fireworm in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the state police crime lab, the Southern University police and local inhabitants all have contributed to the investigation that led to arrest.
Sports director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his ‘interest and pursuit of justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He achieved an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team 'capot' and 'in shock' is dead by Waydes.
“This is an event that you always hope it will never happen”, says Wade.
Volcano spies as on Mexico City
The ash sprayed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Rampen Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was picked up in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and axis were registered for a period of 24 hours.
The center detected multiple rumbles and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on automobiles in districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when a earthquake with a power of 7.1 on the scale of Richter central Mexico came.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police conflicts with Catalan separatists at the morning of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists succeeded with the revolt police, while thousands of participants in rival demonstrations at the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia, which distinguished the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-Separatists who were stopped by the oproer police coaled the agents with eggs and powder paint, resulting in dark dust clouds in the streets that were usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, screening broke out with the police, and the cops picked up their knobs to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Not forget, forgive not’, while their opponents called ‘Long life Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for light injuries they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions continue to rise high in the independent region, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters expressed themselves overwhelmingly to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who were against divorce were the vote boycots.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were hurt last year after the police had tried to stop the vote in the region's voting offices, where it came to violent screening.
Pro-independence groups had struggled on the spot the night of Friday on Saturday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
“Previous year we have experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties gained a vital victory in the regional elections in December, even though it was nigger, it was difficult for them to build on their success this year, because many of their most famous leaders are absent, either in their own exile or in prison, waiting for a trial on their role in organising the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old monteur who filmed the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict was raised by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are increasingly increasing," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in the preliminary arrest since the end of last year, declared that he was taking part in the European Parliament's elections next year.
"A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in the democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after house was caught with a car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was arrested repeatedly in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19.30 p.m.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building had been damaged.
Possibly at a given time a crossbow was fired on the car.
Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to the goal of Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The proromovated Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and the team of Gary Holt came to the same height with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team did not succeed in this season in winning a competition during the Premiership. They have to take the Sunday against leader Hearts, who has eight points on them.
But first the Rangers Rapid Vienna receives Thursday in the Europe League.
Livingston remains unhappy in the meantime. The team won six matches in his division, and trainer Holt has not suffered any defeat since he had replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston loses chances against strong visitors
Holt's team had been able to achieve a predecessor long before the first goal, because their direct way of playing was to deal with various problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but did not succeed in finishing it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up the headball of Craig Halkett, shot the ball above the goal.
The home plow let the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances quietly and self-safely.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston made a opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the punishment area.
At that time the Rangers had a long time of balbesit, but the defense of the home plough was unmergable and the targetman Liam Kelly had not much to do yet.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos provided that Kelly had to prevent a target.
Scott Pittman shot the ball against the feet of Rangers goalman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a proposal from his colleagues in Livingston.
Ongoing, Livingston's punishment was suggested, but they were every time guarded. Two times a punishment cop was refused, one after Halkett's attack on the invasion of Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
'Fenomenal' of Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played outstandingly without exception and continue to overcome the expectations in their race to the top.
Their playstyle and the composition of their team have almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has swooped the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellent organized defence, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall were running on the top of their tens throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, didn't know by breaking.
Although they have often played very well among Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they only succeeded once to swallow the home plague) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classment.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Keulen
Under a radiant blue sky and with a broad smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went on Saturday (29 September) breakfast together in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations between the NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan left to Cologne for opening a huge new mosque.
Coolen is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called on safety reasons when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from collecting themselves for the mosque, but many sympathies came near to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also heard their voice and condemned both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and others are accused of as a carcrate.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicycler dies after collision with car
In London, a bicycler died at a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the crossing point of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 hours local time.
The driver stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on site.
A few months ago, another bike died in an accident with flight crime at Childers Street, about one and a half miles from the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were about to identify the man and his next family.
The road is closed at various places, buses are redirected and cars are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: six cipiers injured in order disturbance
Six cipiers have been hurt in a order disturbance in a severely secured prison for men, according to the prison agency.
The disasters broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ recipients are used to solve the situation, with eight prisoners involved in one section.
The cipiers were treated places for light injuries in the face.
A spokesman of the prisoner said: “There was specially trained prison staff for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff have been treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and the responsible are at least referred to the police and may have to stay behind the tralies longer."
In HMP Long Lartin, more than 500 lives in prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the revolt politician was called to prison for a serious order disturbance in which staff were attacked with billions of balls.
Orca Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possibly positive effects on drought areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of the next week. This is because the remaining energy of orcaan Rosa moves across the southwest of the desert area, which brings risks for flooding.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has already given warnings for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang on Tuesday just above Phoenix. Monday evening it will already be raining.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that ‘ since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra within 40 miles of the border of Arizona.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches, with isolated quantities up to 15 inches in the Mogolon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, will probably get 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
The rain of Rosa may be a blessing for those areas that are not at risk of flooding, because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very anxious, some of this rainfall will probably be favourable, because the southwest is currently being drought.
According to the U.S. Drygt Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are indicated, produces some more than 40 percent of Arizona at least extreme drought, the weather.com reported on a second highest category.
The route of orchestra Rosa reaches the continent through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning Rosa is still on ornamental strength with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and traveling northward at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, which weakens it.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive on Monday in the afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
There may be heavy rains in parts of Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
‘A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona in the early morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass on Tuesday evening by Arizona and in the south of Utah.
“The greatest danger expected from Rosa or her stairs is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert region” said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and devastating flows in the deserts and earth shifts in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempt to murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man are arrested for suspicion of attempts to kill after a 16-year-old with stiff wounds was found in Somerset.
The teen was injured on Saturday at about 4 hours local time in the district of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton.
He was brought to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area in the night, according to the police of Avon and Somerset.
The police ask anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was 'being under the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party.
'A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the unpleasant and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party,' said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been constantly "under the commonness, the anger" of the Democratic Party during his proclamation procedure.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday to the Congress and strongly and emotionally denied the claim of Christine Blasey Ford that he had attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified on her appeal during the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the 'American people' saw the beautiful and incredible character, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
‘A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that is recognised by one of the most full legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,’ he told the multitude of advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he discussed the importance of the Republican rise in the intermediate elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our life takes place.
I don't take part, but I'm actually taking part,' he said.
"That's why I come up everywhere for great candidates."
Trump declared that the Democrats are on a mission to 'resist and hinder us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday at the latest, said a top co-worker of the GOP management to CNN.
Hundreds kill by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the tol grows higher
During a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, where many were faded away from the ground when gigantic waves crashed on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves of up to six meters high on land struck at the time it began to swallow. Many people crashed and the waves destroyed everything on their path.
The tsunami was the result of a earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and became the victim of the tsunami," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Bureau for Aid for Natural Disasters GDP during a letter in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree strains, houses with him, he touched everything on the land," said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he reached the coastline.
Some people climb in a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the Office for Natural Disasters show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges were turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was bizhed by nascoops.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released from the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the power of the nuclear bomb falling on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has still increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “reasonable” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had crashed.
Some deadly victims were probably under the ruin of collapsed buildings, he said. Some 540 people were hurt and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage may be even greater along the coastal line 300 km north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication with Donggala “Light completely flat, we have no information at all”, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300 000 people, ‘the Red Cross said in a statement. Staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” said the Red Cross.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
Amateur pictures shared on social media are hearing how a man on the top floor of a building shouts panicfully to people on the street down to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later a wall of water drops on the coast and is swallowed with buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami provided a major stream disturbance that cut off the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The army is currently sending cargo aircraft with auxiliary goods from Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but the evacues still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport is reopened only for assistance and remains closed for the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death increases above 800.
It's very bad.
Although the employees of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees at their office are searching for accommodation in tents of deck, but passing on the road stages of destruction, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when helping groups started the difficult commission to launch emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign providers with a great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and staff from abroad may not be authorised if the location of a disaster is called for as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
‘It is still a disaster at province level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been expressed.’
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing ones hoped that they would recover their loved ones, such as in the miracles that people like to belong to horrible natural disasters like this.
On Saturday, a boy was taken out of a riol.
On Sunday, relief providers released a woman who had been trapped two days under the ruin with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had occurred in Indonesia earlier this month.
His students were also attached to the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
"If a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional tax," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had crashed had spread in the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who took part in the beach festival.
However, in his messages only one gray vinke appeared instead of two blue vinches.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while providing money automobile in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, a Brink employee who was filling a money-automat in Newport on the Levee was stealing $26,750, according to a press release by the Newport police.
The driver just bought a money automaat in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill him with money, so Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
When he was busy, another man ran behind Brink’s employee and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspicious flights, according to the press report, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is asked to contact the Newport police at the number 859-292-3680.
Canye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Last Saturday he announced the change on Twitter with the words “The being that is formally known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the course of his action on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to propose his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her action during the show for “psychotic reasons”, says the maker of the show.
Ye is not just a abbreviation of his current artist name. Earlier West told that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'yy', said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album at the radio presentationer Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, we are.
I've been transferred from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is earlier a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy of Diddy, but this year announced his preference to the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who formerly worked with West, has also worked with and without the link mark and the capital letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, promised never to use military power against citizens. The country is on the morning of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprise against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use military violence to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military troops fired on a peaceful demonstration on the square, where up to 300 people were killed. In that period, left student movements came up throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and lack of ability to study.
The United States must double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend to research from A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this on the basis of the announcements of A.I. coming from various departments of the US government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced last year its plan: the country wants to be number 1 in the field of A.I. innovations by 2030.
"The budget for research for A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.," said Lee.
A double of the funding can lead to a double of the chance that the next major achievement for A.I. will take place in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's main A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that killed the best player of American Othello, and later he was manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organised by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next game would take place, because it would help discover the next visionars.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, said Lee.
"China does not put our best academics in, the companies do that," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have acquired the best forces of universities to work on A.I. in recent years.
Lee said that American efforts in the field of A.I would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Who doctorates in the field of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Institute for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the Defence Ministry of the United States established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center designed to engage partners from the industry and the academic world in the initiative and announced the formation of the Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Restricted Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
And this month, DARPA announced that 2 billion dollars would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the American legislation which should lead to the establishment of a national Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has been in the cluster for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on possible change in the name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in the name of their country in the Republic of North Macedonia, with a dispute with Greece that has been attracted for decades and would no longer impede the Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and the NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and says that the name of its northern neighborhood means that the country claims in Greek territory. Thus, Greece put its veto against the inclusion of Macedonia into the European Union and the NATO.
In June, the two authorities concluded an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a boycot campaign is not sure that the required rise of at least 50 per cent will be achieved, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the voting note is as follows: ‘Are you in favour of the NATO and the EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Presidents of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth the effort to try to become a member of bodies such as the EU and the NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that have emerged when the former Yugoslavia disappeared.
“I come to vote today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the paraply of the European Union, because this will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient parliamentary members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
A second-third in Parliament would be required to change the name.
The national election committee said that there had not been any reports of irregularities at 13 o'clock.
However, the rise was only 16 per cent at that time, compared to 34 per cent during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered electors came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe, said the 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a chooser in the capital of Skopje.
Premier Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018, during the referendum about the change in name of the country which would open the way for membership of the NATO and the European Union.
For the parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and set chairs for tents placed by people who were boycoting the referendum.
“We are the supporter of the NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a back port,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Aziatic integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that membership of the NATO will provide essential investment for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
'I am convinced that the large majority is more proposing, because more than 80% of our citizens are proposing the EU and the NATO,' said Zaev after voting.
He said that a 'yes' result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A opinion published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43% of the voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
From another peiling, carried out by the Macedonian TV station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70% of them would vote yes.
If the referendum is successful, the rise must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious struggle for the policy of the pro-west government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passs full defense of Brighton and shore
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling briefly met with the defense of Brighton in the Etihad stadium in Manchester. Manchester City won the game with 2-0.
It seemed a flush of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine spits first played the ball on the centre.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, just in the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew to pass a defendant and was too fast for some others at the edge of Brighton's punishment.
Then he gave a passport to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his judge shoe to defeat the targetman Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet," coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he stood deep in the playground of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful passport along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball with him and then sent Sterling to the second stake.
The Sky Blues player put the ball into it just before he was too far.
City takes on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The game takes place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and does not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals were elimination for the play-off, there wasn't much reason to force a new start.
Yet, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are any consequences for the Rockies' participation in the play-off. They are currently a match on the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have powered at least a wildcard for the play-off thanks to their 5-2- victory against the Nationals last Friday, but are still trying to put everything in place to ensure their first division title.
“Of there is nothing in it for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this public and the other team probably plays at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in it?"
The nationals have to announce who will be on Sunday, but they are supposed to be inclined to set Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, stood in the cargo field on Thursday and would nevertheless pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
The right-handed caster of Washington is on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trump Organized Meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while discussing the importance of the Republican rise in the intermediate elections.
“All that we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our life takes place.
This is one of the really big elections, I don't take part, but I actually take part, so I'll come up for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: ‘We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happen now.
And they're determined to take the power back, no matter what they should do for it, you see the commonness, the awfulness.
It doesn't matter to them who hurts them, who they must push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we will not give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder us".
“And we have seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “boos and common and false and lying”.
He named the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to a loud call from the public.
“Do you remember what she answered?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When Activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censur me, that was not a surprise.
Finally, I am the latest in a whole series of Labour parliamentary members who have received that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she resolutely came up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censur because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues like these where Jeremy did not agree with former leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Assembly was announced on Friday: ‘We want the meetings to be including and productive.’
And that was also so during most GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I am already a local Labour parliamentary member.
Unfortunately, today is not the tone of many meetings and has long forgotten the promise of a 'pleasanter, softer' politics, if she had ever begun.
It is increasingly clear that a deviating opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable for the partial leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I, suddenly expected that I would turn around and take a position that I would otherwise never have agreed with, from subjects such as national security to the European unity market.
Every time I speak for a public, whatever I say, there are discouragements on social media calling for the rejection of my candidate as a parliamentary member for the next elections, which reveal the centre's politics and I am told that I should not be a member of the Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I have more happiness than some of my colleagues, because the comments on my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionality and determination of those colleagues who are dealing with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that serious parties are apparently considered to be normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of mistrust’ or change in selection rules the party becomes smaller.
In the last two years, I have often received the advice to keep myself delighted, not just to proclaim my opinion and then I would ‘not come into trouble’.
But for that, I didn't go into politics.
Since 32 years ago, as a schoolchild, I have been a member of Labour, provoked by the neglect of the Government of Thatcher, which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always called for better public services for those they need most, both in my role as a member of the congregation and in my role as a minister.
I never kept my politics hidden, even at the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my controversial points with the current leadership.
To those who have propagated the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy to my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, which is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidate as a member of the next elections or that political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unattended Ayr on the way to the top
Two late tests may have drew the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr triumphs rightly in this wonderful game of the day in the Tentent's Premiership.
They're upstairs in the classing, the only unhappy team of the ten.
Finally, it was both their superior defence and their better opportunities that the homeplower provided the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
“We’ve been having a difficult time during our matches and we’re still unhappy, so I’m a happy man," he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: "All honor to Ayr, they have made better use of their chances than we have."
Grant Andersons try in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a advance for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors game) Melrose could let the figures speak and Jason Baggot succeeded in breaking a try.
Climo provided a penalty for an extra advance for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry net for rest. It became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well, and the experiment of Patrick Anderson, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the advance to five points.
The game was quiet for a serious bless of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on a brancard, and as soon as the game was restarted, Ayr could continue to run out by a test of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then commander Blair Macpherson of Ayr received a yellow card, and recounted Melrose with the extra man when no conversion followed on a test of Bruce Colvine at the end of a match where the pressure was very high.
However, the home plow came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he attacked Climo without the ball, MacPherson behind the upholsterous Ayr-maul provided a touch-down to the penalty-line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did that almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick of David Armstrong and half-back Gregor Henry sent away for the fifth try of the home plow.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Acteur Ford Kieran is going from Still Game in the horeca. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the coming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craig long.
According to official data, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun showed that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the 'blossoming restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is of us': the country-included Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Seelui patrols in a marine office in La Paz.
In public buildings, a sea-blue flag runs.
On all marine bases of the Titicaca lake up to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is of us.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout the country surrounded by Bolivia, the reminder of the coastal line that the country has had to survive after a bloody 19th-century raw material conflict with Chile is still alive, just as the desire to rescue the Pacific.
This hope may have reached its highest point in the last decade, since Bolivia is waiting for a judgment by the International Court of Justice, which should take place on 1 October after five years of discussion.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, looks forward to the result with positive prospects," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will examine the Court's judgment on large screens, in the hope that the Court of Justice in Den Haag will appeal to the benefit of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of pitted discussions, is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is the next year for a controversial struggle for re-electing, is a lot at stake with Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to the return to the Pacific,” he sworn at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in the benefit of Bolivia, and even if that was the case, there would be little change.
The United Nations Agency established in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
That the judgment of the International Court of Justice is only six months after the conclusion, indicates that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation may have become even worse over the past four years.
‘The case around sea access has been caught by the current Bolivian government,’ said Zárate.
The wary rhetoric of Morales has completely undermined all the good will that Chile might have still undermined, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their conversations at a certain point, but it will be extremely difficult to continue talking hereafter.
The two countries have not been an ambassador in each other since 1962.
President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in Den Haag, denies that the decision of the court was unusually taken.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and a chance to“take an end to 139 years of disagreement, with mutual advantages”, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America, is using the maritime issue as a political crucible.
“Bolivia will never give up his right to access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The judgment is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind us.”
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made at a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the moment that State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the enclosed nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the top meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is an 'outopia' that the persistent sanctions and the American objection to a statement that ends the Korean war, North Korea will ever get on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without that Pyongyang first takes important steps in the field of disarmament.
Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump both want a second top meeting.
But there is scepticism, and it is doubted that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would abstain from a arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo intends to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second top meeting between Kim and Trump.
Mode shows in Paris reveal the latest collection huge head covers, soon for sale with you nearby
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, do not look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversize head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a remarkable turn during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hats were not to think away from Instagram this summer and these designers sent their eye-blind creatures on the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a four-wide edge, which hanged over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were water melons occupied with precious stones, a magic hat and even ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
For many of the colorful masks, the lips were sucked, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than on haute couture.
One creation looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this tough fashion, you're lucky.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The gigantic hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the strait hat with a two meters wide edge that everyone wear, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very unpractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also provided for another major creation on the catwalk: a stray beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathpack that included the bag.
The roodoran raffia bag was the most outstanding piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the coming summer big hats and beach bags lie in the shops. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories."
John Edward: Talk skills essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of excellent exam results, and also individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other initiatives of the entire community.
With more than 30 000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for continuing and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a measured school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable fields in excellence in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can not only trust in English when we want to build relationships and a trust relationship with people from other countries.
From the recent test results of this year, we can derive that languages are on the top of the rank, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools attached to SCIS show that 72% of students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72% of the students in German, 69% of the students in French and 63% of the students in Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now appreciated as a professional choice as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
A study by the British Employment and Friends Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the obstacles to filling jobs were attributed to a lack of language knowledge, according to employers.
Thus, language skills are increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now that more and more jobs require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if he has learned a second language, he has a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with non-residents automatically gives a multilingual person an advance in competition.
According to a YouGov level of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. French was the only language that exceeds 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investment in language education is now important to the children of today.
Several languages, in particular those of emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland schools choose the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are engaged in providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bee le faire.

LeBron makes Sunday his debut at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for LeBron James's first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We need to determine how many minutes he'll play.
"There will be more than one, and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James probably will play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six matches before the season.
“In this stage of my career, I do not need matches before the season to prepare me,” he said.
Period of elections from Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a long series of elections rallys
It's the first of five planned rallys of Trump in the next week, including stops in places that are close to him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the vacation in the High Court, Trump wants to build support for the coming intermediate elections, because the Republicans are at risk of losing the control of the Congress when voted in November.
How late will the Trump Rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
The Rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, start tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 p.m.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings of the Applicant Supreme Judge Brett Kavanaugh of this week. These were extra charged now Kavanaugh is accused of sexual wrongdoing and the Senate may wait for a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the Republicans who are candidates for elections in November to get more elan.
The campaign leadership of President Trump said that the next week's five rallys are intended to "stimulate volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Deputies," says Reuters.
'Control over the Congress is so important for his programme that the President is traveling to as much as possible now the busy campaign season begins', said a spokesman of the Trump campaign which did not want to be mentioned by name against Reuters.
The rally of this evening in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia has visited, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the peilings.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him an evil in the peiling”, said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the run to the singles of Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of chances is a fully invented sport concept, but a where players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who now gets the best chances?
"They first had a six-point prompt, and now that is only four more, so we think that the happiness is currently on our side," said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of four points, while there are still twelve in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth said, find that they have a little wind in their seals, and there are many things that give courage, not at least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearable opponent from tea to green, and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well, became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial well with four being a success when he and Thomas stood behind two points after two matches.
His well with which they won the game at 15 was followed by a similar shout, the kind of which you can distract that he believes that the American team has not yet been deceived.
“You have to dig deeply and just worry about your own game,” said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable, but glorious European duo has four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning, they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their rumourous audience, they are the players who have to be conquered on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever who books a European victory when the sun falls above Le Golf National.
Preferred both at the same time at different holes.
It is, however, premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a disadvantage for the Spanish and the Swedish that they no longer got over.
On Sunday, however, no one can help to get your backstage.
The four-balls and four-somes are so fascinating to see by the interactions between the duo's, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and the way a strategy can change in an eye.
The European team has played the best so far and has a beautiful advance in the beginning of the last day, but this four-some session has also shown that Team USA is willing to fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubts.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a beautiful advance on the last day of Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they are on the United States with 10-6.
The cultivated duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, which had it difficult, making them now have four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who would like to lose the trophy she wanted to return in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The US offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but could no longer get his back.
Jim Furyk's team has to score eight points during the 12 singles races of Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who wins four points in a row, while Molinari and Molinari, who received the nickname ‘Molliwood’ after a sensational weekend, are only the second duo in the history of Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening games.
After they had made Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they were beautifully enrolled and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, sometimes showed a wonderful move, but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of 'in the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, and together they struck Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
Nevertheless, it did not fall from a leather roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a bride southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
After a difficult match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls, they later struck Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after they lost the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to recover a disadvantage of four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Furyk has enough to play equality, since they are currently having the trophy in hand.
But now that they've been on the second place for two days, there seems to be too high an attack on Sunday.
Northern Korea says it will unilaterally disarmament without confidence.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuous sanctions result in increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances, the country could not give up its nuclear weapons one-sided.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Annual Assembly that in the last year, North Korea had undergone ‘important goodwill measures’ such as the stopping of nuclear and rocket tests, the decommissioning of the location of nuclear tests and the promise of not spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will in no case disarmament ourselves one-sided."
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to denuclearisation, which would reward North Korea as the further steps take, it was not found that he disapproved the unilateral denuclearisation, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active American President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June when Kim promised to work on the ‘deuclarisation of the Korean Peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea aims at a formal end of the Korea war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington was also opposed to calls to facilitate the hard international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US calls for 'deunclearing first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goals in a compulsory way and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a air castle of the people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the constant sanctions only strengthen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the U.S. leader had done before the week with the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other party was in this issue of denuclearization South Korea and not the US, the denuclearing of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such an obstacle."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was considerably different from last year, when he said the General Assembly of the United Nations that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the US continent were so directed after 'Mr Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'raketer' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim with the United Nations this year to take his courage to take steps to disarmament, but said that there must be a lot and that the sanctions must continue to denuclear North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘Of it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council of Pyongyang should reward the steps taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: ‘The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued firmly and definitely until we have realised the complete, definitive, verified demuclearisation.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has implemented unanimous sanctions against North Korea in order to significantly reduce the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said that next month he would go back to Pyongyang to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Nearly a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea convinced him to set 'going starous requirements'.
North Korea promised this month during a meeting with Moon to decommit a missile and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take ‘conform measures’.
He said that Kim had told him that the ‘conform measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard follow the course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture where it seems cool to study throughout the night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist associated with the Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. For as far as he knows, this is unique in the US.
He got the idea of starting the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleep shortages on learning.
"At the end of my speech, a girl came to me that said, "Why do I just get to hear this in my last year?"
She said no one ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is first organised this year, explains the basic principles of the way good sleep habits help improve akademic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to organise the course when it was established that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts the students see a picture of a sleeping room, where they click on coffee shops, gardins, exercises and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sport performance is affected by sleep deficiencies, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another part, participants are told how long-term sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a site of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what the choice for cigarettes has on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of fierceness on a nail is still there, he says, and by the modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep deficit is an increasing problem.
Care for sufficient sleep, of good quality, must be the “secret weapon” of the student to fight stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep shortages make the brain constantly feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course. He had last year followed lessons from the professor when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to ensure that the course was available to everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study programme before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set up an alarm for their bedtime, not only an alarm to stand up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and leather lights, which can disregard your circadiaan rhythm, which allows you to have trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Menga is to undermine the men of Gerrard
The Rangers saw their struggle again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and the weak team of Steven Gerrard swallowed with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox was hoping for a first victory during a competition since they hit 4-1 in February of St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team took care of the defeat, nearly the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team is now behind eight points on Hearts, which continues at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored at seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers did not succeed in scoreing the equalmaker.
The Rangers now sink to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have more problems, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently a object was thrown to him by the supporters of the visitors.
Gerrard carried out eight changes in his team, they stopped Ayr and went to half the finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed at the same elevental for Livingston, who knew the Hearts to swallow a point last week. He would have been excited about the way his well-trained plowing the opponents knew to block off every move.
The Rangers may have had the most ballbes, but Livingston was more involved.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga gave off the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the victory, but the civil fielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached commander Craig Halkett, but his colleague defender Alan Lithgow shot against the rear pole.
The Rangers did succeed in taking over control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than that they really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
In any case, Alfredo Morelos felt that he was entitled to a punishment kick when he and Steven Lawless were in battle after a quarter, but divorce judge Steven Thomson rejected the request from the Colombian.
The Rangers could only shoot twice to the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was a former goalman at the Ibrox, could easily stop the headball of Lassana Coulibaly and the tomb shot of Ovie Ejaria.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in the prolongation of the general game, no one can deny that they deserve this, even though it was only for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not waxed up against the deep game pattern of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and chose Menga, who stepped the ball with comfort in the goal.
Gerrard provided an interruption with the switch Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wings player passed Morelos, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play the kind of game that Livingston prefers to play, where Lithgow and Halkett continue to stab long balls.
The team of Holt could have increased its advance in the last stage of the game, but McGregor held good stand and blocked Jacobs, and then Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invasion Glenn Middleton of the Rangers still asked for a punishment shot after a prosecution with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning’: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom can TELLEN... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device named geiger counter.
The Geigerteller has not been thinking away from science since then, and also became an icon in popculture, for example in ‘Bells or Coronado’, a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in god's name is that?"
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you hear the effect of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: ‘It's really knocking now!’
“Hans’ Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that holds his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see malicious cells’
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see and kill malicious cells’
vaccine teaches immune system to identify malicious cells in the treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a labo
They can then “see” a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and then re-injected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine learning the immune system to identify malicious cells saw her ovarian anchor disappear more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells in a patient, after which the cells in the labo are adjusted so that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which often occurs in various types of cancer. Then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and to “learn” these cells to deal with cancer cells was already working in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Canye West leaves pro-Trump-tirade and wears MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't go as he hoped.
Canye West was announced during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an inadvertent act in praising the U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would become president candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with on his head a pet with the text Make America Great Again, he defeated a tired against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“Popularly when I talk to a white one, he asks: ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump? He's a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I've been leaving America for a long time, he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parodie in which Hollywood Star Matt Damon stood the dragon with the witness of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee on Justice in relation to the supposed assault of which Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
The tirade of West was not sent out, but comic Chris Rock uploaded them to social media.
It's not clear if Rock with his post wants to stick the dragon with West.
West also complained against the public that he was taken backstage under fire for his pet.
"They hit me backstage.
They said, "Don't get on the stage with that pet."
They hurt me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see how apathically it looks?’ He said that he would attract them superman cape, ‘for that means you can't command me. Do you want the world to be better?
Give me some love."
From the audience, at least twice the spectators of SNL seemed to be embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was heard by an attendee: ‘The whole studio was suddenly quiet.’
West was too guest as a last minute replacer of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with an implementation of the number I Love it while he was dressed as perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who twisted: “To one of our most courageous spirits: REQUIREMENTS TO YOU THE MASSA TROTSEERT.”
But talkshow-presentative Karen Hunter twisted that West was just "usually himself, and that's beautiful."
“But I choose to support and spoile a person who is injuring my community, not rewarding (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do what he wants.
We, too,' she added.
Before the show began, the rapper on Twitter had announced that he had changed his name. From now on he is, he says, “the creature that is formally known as Kanye West”.
He is not the first artist who changes his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega-rapper Snoop Dogg has also behaved the name Snoop Lion and the dead musical legend Prince ever changed his name into a symbol and then known as Prince in The artist.
Prosecution of attempts to kill after stake in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempting to murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in the east of Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The complaint is expected to appear on Monday for the police judge in Belfast.
The accusation will be examined by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington pulls out to toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role as sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent Middle Ages fantasy game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor draws out to the stereo type of the macho hero and says that when young boys see such rolls on the screen, they often think they need to be stiff to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he finds that “there is something wrong” and asked himself how to address the problem of toxic maleness in the era of #MeToo.
Kit, who has recently been married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem should be addressed.
"This is really an important question for me at this time: where did it go wrong with our maleness?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they grew up, so we are faced with this problem now?"
Kit thinks that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic maleness, through its very male personalities.
He continued: ‘What is inborn and what is taught?’
What is learned on TV and on the street, making young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's major questions: how do we change that?
'Cause something has been wrong for young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequences of Games or Thrones when the series ended next summer, because he is “finished with battlefields and horses”.
From November on, Kit plays in a revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is an attacker.
The actor recently revealed that his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so that's how I kept my future family and my life on it from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits characterage Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The group was married in June 2018 on the property of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China reported that the number of Chinese HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820 000 people have been affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, 40 000 new cases were reported.
In the majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
In the past, HIV has rapidly spread in some parts of China by transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people who are in this way HIV is now almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100.000 people.
The transfer of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been criminal since 1997 in China, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Country conservative values estimated to be 70 to 90% of the men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
The diseases are often transmitted by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine in the context of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denys that staff employees have leaked data from Republican senators and draws out to ‘hazardous lies’ and ‘complot theories’
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters contradicts the accusations that one of its staff employees has placed the personal data of three American Senators on the Wikipedia page of the lawgivers.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the accusations are spread by ‘extremely rightly’ bettingers and websites.
‘Luys, lies and more common lies’, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and the private phone number of the U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursday online. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual misbehavior to the address of Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate judge of the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and contained it the information of a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This unjustified accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no case responsible for leaking of this information.
This unjustified accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
The Declaration of Waters was already instant to criticise online, including by former press colleague of the White House Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds angry,’ wrote Fleischer.
“Here you can see that she does not have the temperament to be a Congres member.
If someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he doesn't have to get angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleder appeared to compare the response of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive evil during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the intermediate elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Fifty, if it is true," he twisted.
In its statement, Waters said that its office had informed the relevant services and enforcement bodies of these false accusations.
“We will make the offenders known,” she said, “and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staffmen.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parodie with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that seems to be true of this revival of the Johnny English-franchise, the comic action films with a relaxed spy in the main role, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and returned to life with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is this airy evenatire about how bad we do it the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with extinguishing eyes and flexible facial attractions, at least, succeeds in sending everything in the hundred, also with his second comeback. From his name you can already derive that he is a general comic character that was thought for bioscopers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, a little Clouseau, a little wing Mr. Bean and a piece of that guy who contributed one note to the theme number of Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who ever played Atkinson in the TV spots of Barclaycard (which is all forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor leaves a little bit against his helmet.
Atkinson can show well in this film how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and overmeasurable enough, especially now the "serious" series of films like 007 and Mission Impossible itself comedy includes as an ingredient, and do well.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than for adults, and the delicious disaster of Johnny English comes to me less original and focused on than the jokes without the text of the personage Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Great Britain is in great difficulties.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all the active secret agents of Great Britain known, to the great disturbance of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That is the drop that runs over the emmer of the Prime Minister, a pretensive woman with problems at her head and terriblely unpopular as politics. Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this characteristic that reminds Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her information advisors, she must use a retired spy, since each active spion is compromised.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as a school master in a chique institution, but inappropriate lessons about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because the spionage lessons of English are thinking about School of Rock.
English is quickly invited to Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former sad little Bough, replayed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, an incredible and joviale role that lies under Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are therefore back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloodweed femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Unfortunately, the Prime Minister is in favour of the charms of the charismatic technology billionary who claims that he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start at their odyssee of clever lovely fun: dressed as obers they put a prudent French restaurant in fire, they shove herriage on board the luxury hunting of Volta and English detects pure anarchie when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For that last, all the registers are opened, but no matter how well meant and disturbing the scene is, she's doing what's thinking of child television.
It's not all very original.
And just as with the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself the question: can the British film sector really not take into account any role that affects the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies that the party is considering a plan in which British work four days a week but receive payment for five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn would consider a radical plan in which British are working four days a week but will be paid for five days.
According to the party, bosses of companies would like to pass the savings they do as a result of the Revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) to their employees by giving them an extra day of holiday.
For example, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea fits in the party's economic agenda and the plans to make the country's balance in the direction of workers.
The transition to a four-day week of work has already been approved by the Association of Organisations, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A highly ranked source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “A policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place from one moment at the other, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's efforts to make the balance in the economy more to the benefit of workers and that also fits within the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party promised a four-day working week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the aim is not yet supported by the Labour Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day week of work is not the party's policy and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the "sightless drivers" and the "profits" in the beneficiaries.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share because a Labour government could apply 'abbreviations' on the basis of observed misbehavior.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the management boards of companies and to establish including property funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds), giving 10% of the shares of firms from the private sector to employees that can thus earn 500 pounds a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether the FBI's investigation to Kavanaugh can change their opinion
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support to the candidate.
In an interview sent out on Sunday at '60 Minutes', Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI to discover something that could cause them to change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said to the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Have you done it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
The vote of Graham, however, seems to be stuck.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
"What Dr. Ford is, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one called her could verify it.
It's been 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday is organised in New York the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up will take place on stars and that knows a similarly impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organised in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting here.
Concertgangers who wanted to authorise a free card for the event (unless they were prepared to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteers' work, e-mailing a world leader, making a telephone conversation or creating awareness for the purpose: ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call for action or is this just a different form of 'clicktivism', people give the feeling that they make a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizens reported that more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters have been registered, aimed at a large number of different objectives.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the use of world leaders and to making policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that have to change life of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and statements on the basis of the actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid out or has been collected by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have hitherto had an impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important statements of intention is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of "helping children to realise their full potential". This group promised to Rwanda 35 million to help end under-food in the country after they received more than 4,700 twots from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British Government, of donors, of other national authorities and of Global Citizens, like you, we can make a footnote of the social injustice that is under-food," Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the public during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with food intervention.
In response to one of the most frequent questions on the Global Citizens website in which was asked, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
replied to the group, "It will be a long and difficult way, in which we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, like civil rights and the anti-participation movements before us, we will eventually be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will act this year during the event in New York presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can engage in a 'blockade' to prevent Russian exports of energy - Ministry of Inland Affairs
Washington may be "if necessary" to take a refuge to the marine to prevent Russian energy from coming into the market, including in the Middle East, explained Ryan Zinke, the US Minister for Inland Affairs, as stated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts on the invitation of the legal government, is a predecessor of exploring new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said in the report.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the marine, to ensure that the routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke of invited persons during an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profit-marketing that figged itself as the 'vote of the energy consumment' in the US.
He went on and compared Washington’s Russian approach with Iran’s approach and noted that these were not substantially different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels," he said and referred to Russia as a country that only knows a 'art' with a economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country that offers the most affordable option for European consumers.
For that reason, officials of the Trump Government, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw view from the 'inappropriate' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum of Berlin, has made the 'catched' of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's powerful opposition to the project is sent only for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the idea that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Alexander Novak, Russian energy minister, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The American position has led to a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, called on the US to avoid interference with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industries Bundesverband (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Canselier Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinking seriously' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts, said on Saturday, "hearful thoughts" to take part in the presidential elections after the intermediate elections.
During a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about taking part in the elections.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also involves a woman in the top position," she said according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After 6 November, I'll think seriously about making me electable as President."
Warren executed against President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall and said he "sends this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm up to the bone to make what Donald Trump brings in our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for an investigation from the FBI before we vote on it."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own appendix believes that it should not be preferable in 2020.
Eight-fifty percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be electable, according to an opinion study by the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty-thirds of percent, she would be preferable.
The study showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent before a possible candidate and 48 percent against.
Other names of leading Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to a report by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about the PTSS of Track Palin at a election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he worked in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"By what my own son has to experience, what he experiences when he is back, I have understanding for other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return" she told the public who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans, "they come back a bit differently, they come back and get harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all other soldiers have given for the homeland."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and was accused of domestic violence and attack on a woman, intervening in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police vocabulary in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 States support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the United States, rejecting asylum to victims who are refugees for the violence of gangs or for domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 States and Washington D.C. have submitted a statement to the Washington Court last Friday as 'friend of the Court' in support of an asylum seeker who fights this policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace Case versus Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union has made a prosecution against federal policy in August has not been published.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She's in prison in Texas.
The lawyers of the States supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people applying for asylum in the US as countries with major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy of the U.S. has reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014 in which it was possible for immigrants without documents flying for domestic violence to request asylum.
Karl Racine, the prosecutor-general of Washington D.C., said Friday in a statement that the new policy ignores "decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" in the statement by the "friend of the Court".
The lawyers further argue that the policy that dismisses immigrants from access to the US harms the US economy because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'foresee the necessary labour forces'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister for Justice, ordered judges to no longer asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available to those who escape their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political belief" said Sessions in his announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asiel was never meant to ease all the problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get to deal every day, everywhere in the world.
Hopeful savings in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation also became worse.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while trying to comfort her fevery baby in a evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Inhabitants came back to their destroyed houses and searched for valuable things they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals are overpopulated, as long as they have not been damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of heavy naskins.
Tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the rest of a wall," Haris told a correspondent of the Associated Press and added to this when he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, and later I heard nothing more.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of the United States accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda advertising'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper placed an advertisement of four pages in an American newspaper, praising the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused of the use of the American press to spread propaganda.
American President Donald Trump referred last to the paid attachment of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China to intervene in the US Congress elections of 6 November, an accusation denied by China.
Trumps accusation that Beijing tried to intervene in the US elections, marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an ascaling campaign by Washington to press China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Peking and Washington are currently in an increasing trade war, in which they have imposed increasing import rates.
China's reimbursement rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in States such as Iowa, which support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China and formerly governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American workers, farmers and companies.
"China," as Branstad wrote in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "thinks now the intimidation by publishing propaganda advertising in our free press".
"With spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and a free press, a long-earned tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing, you will find in vain abnormal votes and will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese population may have about the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article," as he did not say what newspaper this was.
The Kavanaugh Debacle disfellowshipped the Republicans from female electorates just for the intermediate elections, warning analysts
Now many important Republicans are sharpening around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, warning analysts that they will experience a relapse, especially among women, during the coming intermediate elections.
The emotions around this subject have grown enormously, and most Republicans have already told them that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be turned back," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he was wondering whether the attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (Republic, Arizona) to prosecute for a FBI investigation will be sufficient to satisfy the evil electors.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they have not forgotten tomorrow and they have not forgotten it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and country speaker for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday, according to the newspaper from Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate Hall, while the Republicans who chose the Justice Committee to approve the candidate time of Kavanaugh, despite the witness of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and the motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"Men say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can continue to go further, especially among women's floating electors in the outskirts and among younger electors, from 18 to 29 years old, who often do not vote even if they do not agree with the President."
Even for the public witness of Ford, in which she further explained her accusation of sexual intimidation against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there could be a return if the Republicans were to persist the appointment.
"This has become a confused ruin for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican Party, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote in the committee, or the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes place in court, but it is also the way the Republicans have done this and how they have treated it," makes Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities United States, a group that helps democrats to be elected, clear to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be divided on the question who they believe after the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority sign up to the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe the witness of Ford and that 35 percent believe Kavanaugh certainly or probably.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought that Kavanaugh was sure or likely lying during his witness while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the plan of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations of Ford and at least one other charger, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford declared last week to the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of drinks when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court has shown her his genitals during a festival during the time they both studied at Yale in the 80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plants a new internet to address Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Injury, the latest project of the technology legend, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which persons have access to any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading thought behind Inruption.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
In this lists of contacts, activities lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it fully depends on the user who has access to any information.
The company calls this 'personal empowerment by means of data'.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea is that the company provides the resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, developers of technology across the world can make their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the website of Inruption.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation so that all their business models are put on their head at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inruption) is to provide the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on network neutrality.
Also after the start of Inruption, Berners-Lee will stay as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new age for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Spiritual and wearer of the Victoria Cross from WO I
The only clergy of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War is honored 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant Colonel, the honorable Bernard Vann received the distinction from the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharp shooter, so he never knew that he had fallen the highest British military honor.
A Memorial stone was revealed by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was 'brilljant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was distinct.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Vann led his bataljon on 29 September 1918 about the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mist and under heavy fire of field shooting and machine guns".
Later he stormed through to the fireline and led the line forward before he only ran to a field shoot and disabled three members of the detection.
Luitenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sharp shooter on October 4, 1918, a little more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "was something, which I know I can never tick it, but also something that makes me feel humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann have also laid a crane after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the braveness of a real hero is shown by the support he receives from a large number of people."
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you've stayed awake all night to see a follow-up Bellator 206 and you don't get to see the most important moment.
On the plug-in ticket from San Jose, 13 battles were listed, including six in the main section, and this was sent out all night in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the time when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom became unpleasantly surprised when the transmitter switched on Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed alert all night especially for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the child program on Twitter as "a bad joke."
"In accordance with the government's regulations, after 6:00 a.m., no more can be shown content that is not suitable for children, and therefore we had to switch to the child program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yess."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said that they were going to adapt their programming to ensure that the viewers in the United Kingdom also have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the back race, we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can discuss nothing until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the change, a lot of messages went over and over and believe me, these weren't all kind.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a public problem.
I can promise that this will not happen the second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally already did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's a unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual nature
The Olympic cleanspringer Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual nature, but that this gave him the motivation to be successful.
The twenty-four years old said that until he went to the continuing education, he didn't realize that "not everyone is as I am".
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about homosexual rights to give others hope.
He also said that parenthood had contributed to lower value to win during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show took out a few months because of disease.
Apparently as a proclamation on the first programme of Laverne, Daley told him that during his youth, he felt 'minder' than others because it was 'socially not accepted to enjoy both girls and boys'.
He said, "To this day, these feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "one" so he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally found out of his nature.
The winner of two bronzes Olympic Medailles has become a prominent campaign leader for the LGBT community and used its presence in the Commonwealth games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he thought he was happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he was in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, who he met in 2013, "I was totally surprised."
Daley married the Oscarwiner, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have so much to endure," he took part in his first Olympic Games at 14 years of age and his father died in cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same height and lowest points.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "all perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a golden medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning golden Olympic Medals.
My Golden Olympic Medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after he had received the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had been asked if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there anymore to sit on the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stomached and he died, I finally could acknowledge that he was not invictorious," he said.
The next year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew that I had dreamed about this all my life. Diving for a home public during the Olympic Games, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first music choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had attacked him strongly on the way to the games and from which he still got chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs can be listened to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in form, on bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he has to see his shape back to make no sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bank by the team captain Jim Furyk for the four-balls and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the drive range, in an attempt to find out where it stops.
Since he was never known on the top of his career for his right drives, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs dwindling balls is routinely punishing.
And if the job in itself is not awkward enough, Mickelson comes in the ninth match on Sunday the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against who is linked to new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four the matches this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind at the beginning of the 12 single matches start well, the match of Mickelson may be absolutely crucial.
Furich has proved to have confidence in this man, even though he could honestly say hardly elsewhere.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a knock on the back, hit his arm around me and said he was ready for it tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play just two matches.
I expected more of it, but it's just like it is, and it's the way we're supposed to act.
He wants to be there, like everybody else."
Mickelson can improve the record of Nick Faldo for the highest number of played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 matches on his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain invaluable influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to get out jokes with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked him sometimes too for the crazy last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than his only game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advances can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable advance before the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Danes made his debut in the game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a front of five points on the Americans, but eventually the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advance in Valderrama; we had a great front in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, called down here, after he had seen the lighting from 2018 with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, well for a front of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this isn't a game yet.
Everyone will have to take full action tomorrow.
Go on and do the plan right.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's what this trophy wins, and we must keep focusing on it.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Delighted about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go forward to the affairs in this area.
Tomorrow, a new challenge is awaiting.
Tomorrow, the individual performances are discussed, and that is another discipline.
It's great to be running out there with a partner when it's okay, but when you're alone for it, your capabilities as a golfer are not really tested.
That's the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he's got to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furich himself has experience with both sides of this kind of conversion on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Mirakel of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that talk," he said in answer to the question how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, had pointed out his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or as in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there is a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We voted our line-up on this and we sent the men on the way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try something from the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task to try to guide the anti-offensive and put Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I chose this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new German warship has been postponed again
The latest fregate of the German Marine should have come into service in 2014 to replace the obsolete warships from the Cold War, but it will last at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, reported local media.
The operation of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the gloednew Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit that a military speaker quotes.
The vessel should have been part of the marine in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered the marine in 2007 serve to replace the obsolete fregates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful canon, a series of air-wear and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to use the latest fregates up to two years behind each other, far away from home ports.
The constant delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to give Germany the opportunity to project their power overseas, are already obsolete by the time they are taken into operation, notes Die Zeit.
The deadly fregate F125 has already taken the newspaper heads last year, when the German marine officially refused to operate the vessel and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it was to be put into a fight mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers, half the man force on the fregates of the older Bremen class.
It was also evident that the ship is burdensome of a serious overweight, which will reduce the performance and limit the marine capacity to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tonnes, which is twice as much as ships of a comparable class that the Germans used in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a disturbing €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems of the latest fregates in their grip are particularly important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German marine is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee in Germany, acknowledged that the marine has in fact "a shortage of ships in operation".
The official said that the problem of the time as a snowball has grown because old ships were removed from the company but no substituting vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the fregates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were still available to be included in the marine.
National Trust listens to the secret life of flager mice
New research carried out on a landstock in the Scottish highlands attempts to reveal how flag mice use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will make new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future preservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland follows the ordinary and small dwarf flair mice, the brown large-eye flair mice and the water flair mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed on key locations around the land to follow the activities of the flager mice over the season.
Co-workers of the NTS and volunteers are also going to carry out mobile studies using manual detectioners.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the crying of the flager mouse and what kind of what is doing.
A map of the habitat and a report are then produced to make such a detailed picture on landscape scale of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results show what areas of habitat are most important for flager mice and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making weeds and how we can best maintain the forests for flager mice and similar species.
Fleer mouse populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have decreased significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting sleeping and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, like flying captures and certain chemical treatments of construction materials and attacks by housecatches.
Fledermices are not really blind.
However, by their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares on land in the country, is taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, inspections of places of sleep and sometimes carry out rescue actions.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for flager mice in Scotland at the property Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of flager mice in Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the land is the ideal territory for the flager mice.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for flager mice," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much is not yet known about flager mice and therefore, the work we do here and in other locations will help us to understand better what they need to be able to threw."
He emphasizes the importance of control of flager mice before carrying out maintenance activities, as the potential unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female flager mice and their boys, allowing for a full local population to be eradicated.
Fledermices are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall down or to interfere with them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said, "We still have to learn much about our flager mice and of many of our species we just don't know how to deal with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to persecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo accusations of assault qualified as 'false news' and said that people want to 'promove themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to complain about the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the accusations have been published.
The peak of Portugal and Juventus is accused of the assault of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to silent about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
With a video for his 142 million followers at Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the accusations were reported, called the reports 'fair news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the field.
I am a happy man, and through and through well" the footballer added to this, smiling.
The lawyers of Ronaldo are preparing a case in which they want to persecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'a inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wishes to compensate for the 'moral damage for a amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The supposed incident was reported to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the footballer's room, where he raped her anal according to the accusation, as read in the accusation submitted to the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the supposed incident and he told her he was a 'good guy' for '99 percent', but sometimes he was abandoned that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple of people had sex, but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later agreed with an external arrangement because she was 'angry for the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to let the scheme be invalid because it has been permanently traumatized by the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was about to go to Real Madrid at the time of the supposed assault and this summer went to the Italian gigant Juventus in a deal worth € 100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will ever regret' when car producers leave
The United Kingdom 'will be ever sorry' if it loses its status as a world leader in the field of car production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister for Economic Affairs.
He added that it was 'careful' that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that if Great Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would suspend production temporarily in the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese automobile producer said that the impact of delays at the border would cost in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"My vision is that when Great Britain crashes from the EU at the end of March, we will see the production in our factory falling down," said Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other automotive products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also made their fears known about the consequences of a EU departure without agreement for the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already shown that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chains in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The Toyota production line runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, where each 37-minute component arrives from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars made on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there may be disturbances at the limits that industry may lead to delays and deficiencies of components.
Toyota can not store in stock more than one day in the factory in Derbyshire, so let the company know, and therefore, in that case, production would be stopped.
Clark said that the Theresa May Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is "exactly agreed to avoid those controls at the border".
"We need a deal. We want to have the best deal, which will enable us not only to continue the current success but also to take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the Today Programme of BBC Radio 4.
"The evidence, not only of Toyota but also of other producers, is that we must be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be suspended, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, who is representative of the Unit at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, when these jobs have been lost, they never come back again.
A spokesman of the government said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House.
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the adjunct prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed for another week, while the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of elections, links between Trump and Russia assistants and the possible obstacles to the prosecution by the President.
The question whether Trump is going to dismiss the adjunct prosecutor-general and thereby endanger Mueller's independence has been maintained for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of having a microphone to hold conversations with Trump and to put off the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, the rumor was about to serve his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted to dismiss Rosenstein 'no', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing from the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both witness.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to carry out a week's investigation of the accusations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the full Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the Chief of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There is not yet a date for it, it might be this week, but it could also be postponed another week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had trouble with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarce of press conferences was not caused by a rejection of the 'interesting' TV journalists, though, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President does more questions and answer sessions than any president for him," she said, without proof of this, "We have looked at the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do that much, and you have seen us do so often in recent weeks and that will take place of a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with digitaries visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president might demonstrate why, he made an open and at times bizarre appearance to the collected reporters.
Minister for Health writes a letter on Brexit to employees of the NHS Scotland from other EU countries
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wish they should continue to work with the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish authorities have declared themselves willing to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn will take the expected decisions.
At the same time, however, the UK's government also suspended the preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this should be uncertain times for you all.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of all the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and outside brings valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and provide benefits for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is surely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing a speed surgery after main injury
The tennessee State Tigers liner, Christion Abercrombie, had undergone a speed surgery yesterday after he had suffered a major injury in the game with 31-27 lost against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tennessean reported.
Rod Reed, the chief coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident took place shortly for rest.
"He came to the sideline, and fell down there a little or more," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the side line before they lay him on a stretcher and took him for further research.
A official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the surgery room in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no details yet known about the type/ size of the injury' and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophorie, is at Tennessee State in his first season after a transfer from Illinois.
He has been tricked up on Saturday at a total of five times before leaving the field, making him tricked up this season at a total of 18 times.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher blankets when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher leaks when buying a house in the UK and using the yield to help the homes according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralise Corbyn's success in order to attract young voters
The increase in the leather is charged to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise £120 million a year to help the homes
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher leaks when they buy a house in the UK and the extra yield is used to help the homeclothes, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn that attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and to tell them on multipayers.
The increase in the leather is committed to persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra yield in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The contribution, which comes up to the current empty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and houses purchased for the rental, may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million a year in this way.
It is estimated that 13% of the new building in London is purchased by people who are not living in the UK, which drives prices and is difficult for launchers to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, in particular in the capital, have become practical 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had petitioned for a reduction in the empty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying land and not using it, and he called on May to cancel quotas on payable houses to restore the 'home investment' in Great Britain.
Corbyn has announced a considerable series of housing reforms, including leases and a termination of "without negligence".
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new homes.
May said, " Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister on the recovery of the British Dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be so easy for people not living in the UK and for foreign companies to buy homes here as it is for hardworking British inhabitants.
For too many people, the dream of having a house has ever become a too vain dream and is the humiliation of life without a roof above the head too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is the management of Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's 'final ambition' to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of releasing the club from the northeast of England, which is currently in the third place in League One, at three points of the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after he brought back St Mirren in the previous season to the Scottish Premiership.
"As a footballer I already wanted to play for my homeland.
But I was elected for the B team and with that the couch was off" said Ross to Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a kid, I saw with my father Scotland often play in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps dressing me.
However, this possibility would only come if I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Succes for me are measured at this moment by 'Can I let this club return to the Prime League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring back the club there."
Ross is only three years in his career as manager, after a period of assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the edge of degradation to win the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his career as footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a crosspoint," he remembered the moment when he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did it all right, I earned fairly well and I knew a few reasonable highlights.
But footballs can be heavy.
There are a lot of things you face weekly.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the field, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm real, I'm so good in my skin, as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The heat wave in summer has increased the income of British pubs who are trying to survive but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw the turnover rise by 2.7 per cent in July, but the income in restaurants was 4.8 per cent less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA Business Advisory Office, who collected the figures, said: "Continuous sunlight and the fact that England took longer than expected part in the world championships, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that the restaurants now became even harder.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the turnover of restaurants in June, only worse in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at the sale of beverages are far the best, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs who are also targeted to sell food also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems like people were just looking for drinking.
In pubs and bars under management, the sales of drinks was 6.6 per cent higher for the month, while food turnover was 3 per cent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the free-time and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sports events remain the main factors for turnover into the exit market.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, although a turnover fall of 4.8% year-on-year is particularly painful in view of the constant cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the operators targeting food, and only the time will learn or the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary refleks."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decrease in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the Pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed from 47 operational groups, with a shared turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children has a secret account for social media that they keep hidden from their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey among 20 000 high school students revealed growth in "false Insta-pages"
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students say to have a 'main account' that they also show their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, makes accounts for social media that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey among 20 000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'main account' that they show to their parents, while still have personal accounts.
A mother who came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter accidentally discovered a teenager who asked others to ' rape' her.
The study, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools, discovered that 40 percent of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half had to keep track of personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said, "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'vote of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Sports
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of the Scottish athletics world, as non-executive Director at the general annual meeting of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland at the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great chance for the managers of sport to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously from its election in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am happy to be able to serve for the athletes and I hope that I can make a contribution and help manage the sports in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and the 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four golden Olympic Medals, who now regularly comment on the BBC, could no longer run after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only the time will learn or I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terrible hard work, but I am now completely recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support statements!"
Advertising for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has divided the online opinion with an advertisement in which sowing mothers are compared with cows that are milked.
To mark the introduction of what is called the most quiet breast pump in the world, Elvie, the consumer technology producer, has issued an ironic, on music videos inspired ad to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to cold mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hooked shoe on a song that contains lyrics like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can see nothing of it' and 'In case you weren't watching it, these are not yeasts, these are my breasts'.
The refrin continues with: "Pamps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the ladies."
However, the advertisement, published on the Facebook page of the company, directed for an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has attracted hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that in this the "horror" of the dairy industry is accepted.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
As we do, they must be expected to get and dispose of to produce milk, but in their case the babies will be removed within a few days after the birth" is written in a response.
The breast pump of Elvie fits discreet in a nutrition system (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noticed: "This is naturally traumatic to mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilaric'.
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would buy one if I still gave a breast-feeding.
That pump gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking for it too much.
This is a genial product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny advertisement, focused on moms who pour (whole on the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like to be 'cows'.
This ad is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreet hidden in their behas.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who collar sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is fully silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreet in a food condition, so that women have the freedom to move, to hold their babies and even to go out while they are on poles.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says about this: "The Elvie Pump is a so revolutionary product that it deserved a strong and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between colding mothers and milk cows, we wanted to put the plunger and the associated challenges in the appearances and at the same time show how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time the pump of Elvie picks up the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of immigrant children in prison has reached a peak, although the number of monthly borders has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the hard-feeding retoric and the hard-feeding policy introduced by the Trump Government makes it more difficult to put children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to risk their own chance of staying in the country by logging in for a child.
That risk has increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households have to issue their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in a witness to the convention that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have notified themselves as sponsor for unguided minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no preliminary penalty.
"But 80 percent of those who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal strangers.
We're persecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to treat the children faster, officials have introduced new rules, which require some of them to appear before the court within one month after the start of the prison, instead of within 60 days, which was the standard, according to the employees at the shelter
Many of them will be before the court through a video conference, instead of personally, to address their application of legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are considered not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children remain in arrest, the greater the chance of becoming anxious or depressed, which may cause violent outbreaks or flight efforts, according to the shelter employees and reports from the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are more frequently ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for this, or to say goodbye to friends, can contribute to the trauma that many of them are fighting.
Syria commands the US, France and Turkey 'occupational power' to withdraw immediately
In a talk on the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Muallem also called on the Syrian refugees to return, even now that the war is in the country in the eighth year.
Moualem, also vice-president, said that the foreign troops are illegally on Syrian ground, under the predecession of fighting terrorism and that 'this will be done accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been deprived and driven from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred battle until we have released all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "eventual illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which are mainly working on training and counselling the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-shaped country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he declines to 'distribute some Western countries irrational fears' which leads most refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politics a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there is no reconstruction aid available for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomas say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last important ballwork of the rebels, has created the possibility to start political conversations.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has abandoned a large-scale attack from Syrian troops supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement knows 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action will focus on jihadists, including warriors of the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, which will be 'extinguished'.
Staffan de Mistura, UN Deputy, hopes soon to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for after the war for Syria and to open the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions of the Syrian Government to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be restricted 'to the revision of the articles of the current Constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second deadline
According to that logic, Mr Trump would win elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidentship is prematurely terminated by a settlement procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be the most dramatic final of a presidentship ever.
At this time, however, there are no signs of visional fatigue.
Since 2014, the view figures during 'prime-time' at CNN have doubled more than 1.05 million and almost threefolded to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time' compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' from MSNBC is at the top of the reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC drama 'Designed Survivor' a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
She asked.
"He said then, 'Because he makes me laugh,' Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, in contrast to all the other on TV, the story lines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that can afford only the most privileged viewers.
And yet, it goes beyond a well-informed citizen to be, when you notice that you've been looking at a panel experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which talks about the jack of Paul Manafort's paw learning that cost $15,000 ('a clothing piece full of excessiveness' according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
I'll never be able to look at Super Mario again in the same way.
"What he does to give you the idea that it is a reality show, is partly that he stops you with something new every evening," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role distribution of the Trump show and the daily plot exchanges (a struggle with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea you're going behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside looking at MSNBC while he opened CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh, who had to appear for the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember that we did all those strange shows, not so long ago, and that the people said "this is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it appears that they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting intermediate elections for the House of Delegates
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flood of money, thanks to a rearrangement of a choosing district, which requires two sitting national representatives to fight for the same seat.
The recently reclassified district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it up against another national representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the ancient 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January considered that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified ('gerrymanding') in the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knocking party in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Demokratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb was a famous name in Pennsylvania after a nineth victory in a well-looked special election for the 18th election district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considers to punish El Salvador for support to China and has rejected it.
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners released the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to revoke the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, spokesman of the Ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
But only punishments were considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $ 140 million of U.S. aid in 2017, for control of drugs, development and economic support.
The penalties proposed, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with a large unemployment rate and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings passed, North American and Central American officials launched a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in trying to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But half September, some top officials from the government told them that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible penalties against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence holds a speech at the conference, which is now planned for half October, as a sign of the importance that the government confess to the meeting, says diplomats.
And the three American messengers have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a hard message about Washington's penalties.
A spokesman of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next step may be the report of the Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible opposition of the Trump justice, which has now become public.
Mueller is probably also going to focus his research on cohesion between Trump's and Russia's campaign in an attack from Russia on our elections.
When the Congress changes in color, Trump must account for that institution, just as he is ready to turn back to the voters, and maybe he should go responsible for a jury in a court.
That is a lot of myths, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that of its equivalents in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, will have to make choices that will determine how long the battle will take.
In 1938 German officials were ready to carry out a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had offered resistance and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We fail and thereby miss an opportunity to prevent the years of blood pouring that followed.
The course of history turns around such benchmarks and this accelerates or slows the unforgettable march of democracy.
Americans are currently faced with various of this type of bow points.
What will we do if Trump Adjunct Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time when this magazine reported that he had suggested, last year, to take in secret conversations with the President and that he had speculated on the suitability of the President for his office.
Rosenstein says that The Times report is not correct.
"How will we react if the new investigation requested by the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and unfair testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the intermediate elections for a Congress that will call Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail by the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever occupied my ambassadors.
She survived, immigrant to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me away to put on lights for the Sabbath on the table on which a swastic is pictured.
With that as my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that after the impressive equivalence in Spain with Villarreal earlier this month, a victory in Austrians puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the European League.
Through a kneeblesure, the mid-fielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first match from the season until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that result as a jumping plank for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good number of eleven," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the idea that something fell to win and came out the game with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but over the whole game, a equal game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
The coming Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game because they also had a good result in their last match. But if the public comes behind us, I'm sure we can continue to push and we can get a positive result.
Last year has certainly been heavy, of everything that happened with my blessings and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feeling good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can persist now, leave the last season behind us and be successful again."
Women can't sleep because of fear of their retirement
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the National Wide research said they talk to their wives about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
"Men want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the steps needed to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse(o)t(s) and the children: You can't prepare your family to give care if you don't make your wishes known in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices may be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial adviser in the arm: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay these expenditure.
Your long-term funding choices may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenditure, or use the own funds as insurance as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when insurance is required.
Make sure a full authority for health care, so that you can designate a trusted person who can overlook your medical care and ensure that professionals keep your wishes in case you are not able to communicate anymore.
Consider also a full power for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on behalf of you and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can't do this anymore.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly father or mother hits a medical emergency and is going to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Put these details in a written plan, so you have the information manually.
"They are not just the financial matters that are important, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that plan comes."
You have been shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a air pressure gun when he walked home after a little night.
The victim, forty plus, was located in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdominal and hand.
Agents described the shooting that took place around 02:30 BST as an "willing act".
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami hitting the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the death count will increase further.
Because the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the county of Donggala, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have evacuated after the disaster has occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebes and is located at the end of a small bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th birthday when the tsunami hit.
Dongga is a reign that extends over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The government, an administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Central Cellebes, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected by tsunamis according to the Indonesian Emergency Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami demanded more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit in the west of Dongga in 1996, with nine deaths.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on the north of Sumatra provided a tsunami that hit 14 countries, and a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Atjeh.

The oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested on charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the Vice-Presidency, was arrested on charge of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, intervening in a report of domestic violence and offering opposition during the judgment, according to a report released on Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female familiar tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took the phone from her.
Palin is held in prison in the house of conservation Mat-Su with a $500-cut trip, reported KTUU.
He appeared to the judge on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, sure" when he was asked for this, the network reported.
Palin is accused of three infringements of class A, which means that he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of an infringement of class B, which is criminal with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is accused of criminal facts.
In December 2017, he was accused of treating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the supposed mistreatment.
This case is now served by the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of a mistreatment in the home atmosphere, intervening in a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon affected by the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group in 2016 after having linked her son's violent behavior to PTSS that he would have remained in his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after a earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a power of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been disabled while the expectation is that the death rate will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal Prosecutors require a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York require the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, with eight persons killed, a rare penalty that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, used a hired truck from Home Depot to perform an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he traveled in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the chargers will have to prove that Sajpov has killed the eight victims "intentionally" and has caused "intentionally" serious physical injuries, according to the intention that the death penalty is required, which was submitted in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the assault, a federal grand jury approved the charge with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal chargers against organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the chargers and described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as 'great, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitj Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hern Ferruchi, Hern Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the statement of intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years ago that in the Southern District of New York there was a case in which the death penalty was required.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was condemned for the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to lifelong prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed after they had been sentenced for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not prove wrath in the days and months after the attack, according to the judicial documents.
He told the inspectors he felt well about his act, the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack after viewing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the accusation.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his room in the hospital, the police told me.
He did not claim to be guilty of the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defences representing Sajpov, said that he was "naturally disappointed" with the decision of the defendants.
"We think that the decision to claim the death penalty instead of accepting a debt confession in exchange for a lifelong prison without the possibility of remedy, will only extend the trauma of these events for all interested parties," said Patton.
The defence of Sajpov had earlier asked the accused to not claim the death penalty.
Conservative Member said that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilise a 'volks army' during a protest at the Conservative Party Conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians should feel the 'heat' of the Eurosceptists, while one of the own Members of Theresa May proposed to give him the lead of negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants at the March in Birmingham that the UK would have already been out if Mr. Farage Brexit minister.
However, the challenge of May in the reconciliation of the strongly divided series is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep his Chequers Compromis on the ride while attacked by Brexites, Remainers and the EU.
Consultants held that she will continue and will try to conclude a deal with Brussels despite the disasters and thus force Eurosceptists and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
At a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone said he wanted to throw 'Chequers in the trash'.
He suggested that Farage should be riddled and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he finished the service, we would be out of it now," said Bone.
The Wellingborough parliamentary member added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the garbage."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone pointed out that the public opinion has been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has changed and wants to remain in the EU is completely false."
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the March and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not voting, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are chosen.
Let Chequers fall and listen."
In a direct message for May, she added: "Presidents keep their job when they observe their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel hot if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to say "We're not letting you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to put our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, to fire.
We mobilise the national army of this country that has brought us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again."
In the meantime, Remainers marched by Birmingham and ended this March with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists swing with flags on which Tories was against Brexit, after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Superior House, jokesed about the security problems of a party app of the Conservatives at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide for IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There's not something like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plant 'going to think good' about candidate for presidentship
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to think good about her candidateship for the presidentship after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts told about her future during a meeting in a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be reselected in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican delegate who was co-president of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the center of speculation that she might start fighting with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with choosers in a town hall since Trump came to power.
One attended asked her if she would make her preference for the presidentship.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after killing Wayde Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the death of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 at an ET press conference at 11:00.
They released a video from the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who can be seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot wound in his head and died of its consequences," police officer Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been interrogated and has known to be present at the place of crime, to be in possession of a weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1,98 meters junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games and started the last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory after orders of team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders of Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely cold when he defended his position and Boltel invited to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the pit and let Hamilton ride in the printed stairs of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on the head after a wheel-on-wheel action, which caused the Ferrari rider to release space in the inside after a double movement in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was the seventh after the first round on his 21th birthday.
Then he was a long time leader of the race, because he stayed with his banding choice and mixed on fast finish, so that he could get Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally he went to the pit in the 44th round, until he couldn't increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen was fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend, and he was a real gentleman and left me.
The team has done his best for the places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculated senator Dianne Feinstein at a election meeting on Saturday about the fact that she did not persist in being the source of the leaked letter of Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
As spoken at a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly discuss the witness given by Ford to the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he told that what happened in the Senate showed that people could be "common, unfamiliar and unfair"."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and common and unpleasant and unfair," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and that they then say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you play?
Do you remember her answer... you leaked the document - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't leak," he added to this, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the accusations to the address of Kavanaugh were mentioned was sent to Feinstein by Ford, which was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't keep Dr. Ford's accusations hidden, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go confidentially and I treated it confidentially as she had asked."
But the president proved not to believe her denial and he commented on it during the meeting on Saturday evening, "I'll tell you a little, that was not a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The President further suggested that the Democrats would use the accusations for their own purposes, as he defended the candidate for the Supreme Court, who is accused by three women of sexual immorality.
"They are determined to take the power back, with all necessary means.
You see the commonness, the insaneness, they don't give anything to who they hurt, about who they should drive to take the power and get control back," the President would have said, according to a report by the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return race with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had taken the lead with two goals by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home plows alongside before Dwyer brought the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard made the equaliser for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen with two goals definitely set the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to fix a defeat on Friday evening to beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time of this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three matches.
The opening hall of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on a assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the front, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan returned the home plow to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the suggestion for the comparator of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants entered the first rest with a prompt, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home plow reappeared and Bouchard brought them again on an equal stand with a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He provided the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic leader dies while ensuring that hundreds can escape the earthquake in an aircraft
A air traffic leader in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he ensured that a plane with hundreds of people could rise safely on board.
More than 800 people have been killed, and many are still missing after a heavy earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; a earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Powerful afterchocks still harass the area and many are buried under the point of the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their life, the 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-and-wear trafficstores of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He continued to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, which was ready at that time on the start, could rise safely.
Then he jumped out of the trafficstores when he thought it was on the crash.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear that," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can increase in thousands and gave the National Disasters Control Agency information that access to the cities of Donggla, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"Man assumes that the number of deaths is still increasing because many bodies were under the ruin and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the agency.
Flowers that reached a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral celebration will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and stocks.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News: "Every minute is brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they will happen.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and he said to the present military: "I call on you all to work day and night so that all the tasks needed for evacuation are completed.
Are you ready for it?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was already hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, with more than 550 people.
Aircraft crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says there is one man missing after a crash in the lagune
The airline that carried out the flight crashed in a Pacific lagune in Micronesia now says that one other man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had left the sunken plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a press release missing one male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they were working with the local authorities, hospitals and inspectors to find the man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to the questions about more details about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped the rescue of other passengers and crew members after the plane had hit water during the landing on the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people were brought to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What caused the crash and what the exact order of the events is remains indefinitely unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Marine both say that the plane has landed in the lagoon and the landing course has missed.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot over the landing course.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told him that he and some others succeeded in the water, which came to their means, to go to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardessens were paniced and shouted and that he had a not serious head wound.
The U.S. Marine announced that seafarers who were working in the vicinity of a yard also helped with the rescue operations by bringing people to the coast with a blowable boat, before the plane was further sink in the approximately 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the last 20 years, 111 persons have found death in crashes of airlines registered at the PNG but that they do not relate to Air Niugini.
Analist sets the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisitoir on Friday in the reopening process of a man accused of living burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analist of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, gave a few hours of witness as a witness expert in information analysis.
He made clear to the jury how he had used the phone call data to fix the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left life.
Rowlett told him that he had received the location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was at Chambers on the evening of her death, which was in opposition to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police again talked to Sanford.
Sanford stood in the witness bank on Saturday and told him that he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was talking the truth when he told that he was in his truck at Sanford during that night, Sanford said that he was lying because my truck was then in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him that he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone data indicated that they knew each other only one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew the messages, calls and contact details from his phone some time after the death of Chambers.
"He knew her from his life," said Hale.
The defence begins on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to start the discussions later that day.
The High Wide: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hiphoptrio wants to discuss the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol says that hiphop is distant from the origin of political opinions and the map of social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' again popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a recent experience in Great Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A young girl from New York takes a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A child girl from New York will take a couple for the judge for a dismissal for discriminatory reasons after receiving a wrongly sent text in which the mother was complaining about 'a black again'.
The couple refuses to be racist and calls the case 'depressing'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her distress when she discovered that the new child girl, Giselle Maurice, was a negroid woman when she met her first day in 2016.
'NEEEEEE WEERE ZO'N ZWARTE', wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she would like to send it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the U.S. newspaper of the New York Post, the 'uncomfortable' Plasco-Flaxman Mrs. Maurice dismissed when she realized her blunder. She explained that their previous child girl, Afro-American, had done bad work, and that she had therefore expected a Philippine.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a working day and then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice takes the couple for the court to get a compensation of $350,-- per day for the 6 months for which she was hired to bivacuate internally with the family, or without contract.
"I want to make them feel that you just don't do something like that," says Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the claim that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after they had insulted her, fear that they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said husband Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
You don't know what to do."
Concerning the case with 'depressing', Plasco said that his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
"Are you going to persecute someone like that?
That's not so sympathic," added the investment banker.
While the case is still in progress, the public opinion is quickly involved in chaptering the couple on social media, where it is intimidated for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public wouldn't have much interest in a speaking beer, revealing newly arrived letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It is difficult to stand in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, still for the first publication.
With what we know now about Paddington's huge success, it's very nice."
She told her father who, before he was inspired to write the child book on a small toy bear, as a cameraman worked at the British Sender BBC, was optimistic about or his book would be disappointed. She added that the 60th birthday of the publication of the book 'bitter sweet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as "a very prominent member of the family," she told that her father was secretly proud of the final success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
"But because Paddington was so vital to him, it seemed almost like a child's performance; you're proud while you've done nothing for it yourself.
I think he experienced the success of Paddington so much.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for success."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her by phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors for nothing tried to save her life.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected not to get it,' said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then the call from Nad came to say that she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be with you again.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pomping became slowly elaborated and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process disabled everything further.
I could just sit down there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't be sorry, screaming or crying, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I had to be great."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who now grieved about her daughter's death, went in the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat down with my head and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Raw women put messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide make themselves strong to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys insert inspiring messages and phone numbers that can call people in need for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis, her son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any older person to feel like how I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney in the English county Gloucestershire, tells that her son was a promising chief cook with an incredible smile.
"He was familiar with his smile.
They always said that his smile lighted every room."
Yet he already stopped working before his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of life.
Mrs Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about a chain reaction."
Mrs Davis made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and what you can talk to, though it's just a friend.
Don't keep silent - talk about it."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark who was her 15-year partner, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sore or depressed or something," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He sat all on the ground on First Christmas - when the kids packed out their gifts, he didn't look at them at all or so."
She said that his death was a great trauma before her, but that they should handle it, "It's pulling the whole family apart.
It's gonna distract us.
But we all have to continue and continue fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future insecure while FBI starts research
'I thought that if we could actually get what he asks, a study limited in time and scale, we might be able to create a little more unity,' said Mr Flake last Saturday, which he added, he was afraid that the committee was falling out of each other, in the middle of a firmly anchored patch within the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican followers want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The intermediate elections have been over five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, their attempts to get their husband elected in the highest court in the country are seriously difficult.
George W. Bush has already called members of the U.S. Senate to lobbye for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush, and so his wife Ashley knew, who was Bush his personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI has finished the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Mike Pence, Vice-President, the opportunity to make the decisive vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
Number of runners in North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawyer, the number of North Korean runners has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-sug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, declares that last year there were 1.127 runners, compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher punishments for human smugglers are the most important factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The large majority of the runners from Northern Korea will eventually be offered to South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, over 30 000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavy-safe demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between both Koreans.
China considers the overlaids more illegal migrants than refugees and often turns them off with violence.
The relations between North and South, which are still formally in the ability to war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, which was particularly discussed the progressive negotiations on demuclearing.
This meeting took place after the historical meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed in large terms to work at the nuclear demand of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in the elimination of the US penalties since then.
"Without faith in the trade of the US, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament," said Mr Ri during a talk on the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him incapable to serve in the Supreme Court of Justice
President of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate judge of the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him incapable to serve in the Supreme Court of Justice
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday during the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help to think that if a woman behaved like this, he would call her "hysterical"," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness to the Senates Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
At the time of his opening declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional; he sometimes screamed almost and was especially distressed when he told about his family and his high school.
He also strongly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him "great and coordinated character murder", organized by liberals who were evil that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi declared that she found that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not suitable to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and through the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats," said Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to set an impediment procedure against Kavanaugh if he was to be appointed, and the Democrats would receive the majority in the House of Deputies.
"I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth in the Congress, or to the FBI, he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he serves now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia (usually shortened D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was worried as a democrat that Kavanaugh would go to speak against the "Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade" (law for payable health care). Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh raised questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
"Don't expect us to stand joyful when a hysterical, presumed person is now appointed in the Supreme Court," says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It's a righteous tired of months and years of excited anger that goes over, and she can only cry to get it out of it.
"We're going to cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued: 'I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere leading and who told her that she was going to cry when she became angry. She developed a method, which always started crying when she was angry. To the one she was talking to, she said, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried further.
I just thought that was brilliant."
Tears are partially allowed to express anger, because weeping is essentially ununderstanded.
One of my best remaining memories from a former job, in a office dominated by men, is when I had to cry terriblely because I was terrible angry. An older woman, a dead business leader who everybody was a little afraid of, grabbed me into my necklace and screwed me into a staircase.
"Let them never show you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you on the cabinet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart at his candidateship for the presidentship.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an external affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'catch harm' or 'apenstreken') and withdraw from the race, the deep disappointed Mrs Schroeder believed that there was no reason why she would not apply for herself.
"It wasn't a well-considered decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow white and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with funding recruitment, so she promised not to join in if she couldn't bring up $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give them $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she held her speech in which she announced that she wouldn't start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her - of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach choosers instead of Members, and of anger about sexism - that she inflicted it.
"Mrs. Schroeder remembered how the media responded to her."
"They'll have thought that Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my grave stone?
"She cried?"
How the trade war between the US and China can extract favorably for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were excessive, and although the struggle has not been struck for a long time, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be favourable for Beijing.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, gave the first warning this year by increasing taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation became known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (150 billion) on goods; half of all goods coming from China the US.
Beijing has taken in naturala represailles every time, most recently by raising rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion on US goods.
China has promised to compare the US every time, and the world's on a second largest economy is probably not going to blink quickly with the eyes.
In order to allow Washington to bow, requests must be accepted, but public bowling for the US is too painful for the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays smartly, the trade war with the US, China, could support positively in a long term, by decreasing mutually dependent on the two economies.
"The fact that a rapid political decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing, which would allow one of the two countries to get into an economic free fall, is actually far more dangerous than observers previously recognized," says Abigail Grace, a research collaborator of the Centre for a New American Security, a thought tank specialised in national security issues addressing Asia.
Syria 'Clear' to allow refugees to return, according to Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a more than seven years of war.
During his speech to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, declared that the circumstances in his country are improved.
"Today, the situation in the place is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalise the situation on the spot.
All circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have escaped their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are about six million people in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to restore the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept any conditional aid or aid from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 against 10,5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of the Danish commander Thomas Bjorn reached the number of 14,5 points needed to defeat the US.
The star of the U.S. team, Phil Mickelson, who was fighting almost all the tournament, left his long battle from the tea into the water at par 3, hole 16, and granted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, was beautiful in all its rounds and became one of the four players who ever picked up 5-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest classed player on the world rankings list, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the fake to his landmate, John Ram, who went down the American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The huge pride that I feel because I defeated Tiger Woods. I always followed that guy when I grew up," says the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played on high level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. commander, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these boys, they've fought.
Soon this morning, we have made Europe a little more difficult.
We bought opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very good.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud I can be their leader.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We've been playing."
