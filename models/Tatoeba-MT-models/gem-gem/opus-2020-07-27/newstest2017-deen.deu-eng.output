28-year-old cook in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre.
The brother of the victim said that he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt him, "Everything went up with him again."
The body found on Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, announced the judicial medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are ongoing.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who worked earlier as a cook in Boston, had been asleeping work six months ago as a cook at the Sons & Doughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
A speaker of the Son & Doughter said that they were "chocked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we'll miss it painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and compassion are with Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia announced that Frank first lived in hostels, but that "the things eventually went up for him."
"He found a apartment, he had a friend," told Louis Garcia KGO.
Louis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His way of associating with his family was always cooking us something, preparing us for dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swept with the power.
"For everything that went wrong in the world, he was this unsleeved diamond who brightly shined every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case shall be asked to call the SFPD's reference phone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has made this clear in an interview now.
"I'm always put in drawers or get sticked up from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and the reality."
"I myself do not want to be perfect and successful forever."
"Please, these things are rather tricky to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, forming TVs with relaxed duck and mexican food, says the magazine.
To the white glow, they bring the question of the child's wish: "We women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child game" Aniston is to see as a single-born mother of two sons.
The movie is running with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are overlookable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues was looking for a little differentiation with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sportpyramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday evening, they hunted home in the fast galopp.
A mile at this speed, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - was back near horses.
He was able to lead himself with his family over the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even swing himself for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid provided the man from home in the framework of a small Gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.
There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorberblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already tailed him.
Longer is the 18th prizeholder of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prizemaker Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means me very much," says Langer, "because it is forgiven not only for sports success but also for social commitment."
For decades longer has promoted growth.
And so he also passed on the price money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 more outstanding athletes, the two-fold U.S. master winner was added to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
One of the excellent athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Spring Rider Alwin Shockeöhle and posthum of the Handballer Erhard wonderful.
Many of these sports campers came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrated society moved to the spring stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the large animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP Trade Agreement - that is what both Clinton and Trump want.
Unfortunately, however, the two U.S. presidency candidates are in the field of tax and energy policy as well as in a principle issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them in doubt rather small and warns about how the State can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He would be quite different, claims Trump.
It will reverse regulations massively, and it will be strong for a comprehensive tax reform with lower tax rates - for private and businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the State has certain tasks to fulfil, he has the opportunity to open disadvantaged and needs money to do so.
That's why taxes would increase for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton have to be invested in them almost once.
The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea party fleet of the Republicans.
So on Trump, there could be still party-internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and re-establish coal promotion in the United States.
Oil promotion is also intended to be possible in so far protected areas, and the Paris Climate Protection Agreement is intended to cancel it.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explore the renewable energy with its investment program and calls for "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It's probably going to be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in the infrastructure - even in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.
TPP, the trans-Pazifican trade agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, however, both the United States do not want to isolate from international trade - but just protect American jobs better.
They should then be better paid, for example, Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to increase to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he may not be changed.
However, the major discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand there is Trump, who wants to evacuate the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics insist on him so that the budget deficit would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least the rich to demand that they pay more taxes, and their critics say that more taxes are not the solution either.
Flight: "Every fled woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Everybody's got a baby who's at least one year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curious in the room with great eyes.
His mother's staring on the table plate.
Until she notices that she is watched.
She smiles shortly and kisses the kid.
The scene works normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a sectoral business leader of Condrobs, a member of social assistance services in Bayern, and inter alia deals with the issue of women on the escape.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all flourished women and their children in Bayern.
In January, Condrobs opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Municipal Women's Assistance.
She was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - even not as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is not too excessive to say: Every woman who comes here has experienced sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Mans flee for wars because they are being politically persecuted because they are threatened with torture or death or because their families send them as a hoper to Europe," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape are overwhelming: "Many are stealing secretly because they do not see any other way out."
In their home, they have experienced sexual violence, compulsory vision, honor killing, slavery or compulsory prostitution.
That's what's going on.
It's going on on the escape.
"It is not a rareness for this snatch for a bottle of water, for example, to demand a sexual action," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who thinks that ends as soon as they arrive in Germany, misfortune, says Bahr.
Even here, alone women in refugee accommodations would often be considered lesswert and worst abused.
This causes about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the northern Munich to be traumatized.
"Some of the children have certainly not been generated voluntarily."
Many women are used to say nothing.
"Or they do not trust in speaking openly about the experience because the shame is too great."
Since they often don't know how to help, it needs more accommodation only for them, Bahr demands.
In Bayern, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
To ask whether they know from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no.
In the upper plumb and overfranks, there is no such thing in accommodations of governments.
Even in swabs alone flourished women are not placed separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press speaker.
In Upper Bayers, Sub- and Middle Francis there are floors or homes in some Community accommodations only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be put separately from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important that men and women be housed separately."
"If there is a lack of privacy or being brought together men and women, it can - continue - come to violence against women."
In particular, the laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, says the study.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen at the Andrang, which is on the house in Munich.
"We have a long waiting list since we talked about it," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors struggle: demands for new labour fighting measures
Deputy representatives of assistant doctors have called on their trade union to approve new work fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested its entire Council to authorise more work fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that Ministers had failed to address the concerns about the Treaty.
Assistance doctors and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the Chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would remain "continually quiet" to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and to request official negotiations for all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today has made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of escalating work fighting measures starting at the beginning of September.
The disputes caused assistant doctors to struggle six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed members of BMA during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract should be favourable and adopted.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the contract for doctors would be compulsoryly introduced in England.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsides"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and to announce an official end to the persistent war of words and economic sanctions for eight months.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't reject the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handbeat, yes.
But Putin's smiles seemed smal and he hardly shined warmth, even for his reconciliating conditions.
Recipe Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his "loved friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have acted like never happened a bad thing.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But a sound, sustainable cooling from Putin showed that the Head of State had forgotten nothing about Russia.
Instead, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the resignation of a Russian battle plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was burned.
Putin divided out and accused Ankara of falling in Russia.
It was even bigger because it was committed by a supposed friend.
The rebuilding of the vetrau will be difficult if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
At once, it seemed as if the Turks were to bear the blame for everything.
Most seriously, the accusations of executive officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's areas, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He struggled this feather.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia could book a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a weapon restraint are clear.
Erdogan needs mostly all the friends he can get after he has been dismissed in a failed country nearly his office.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90 %.
In Russia, travel organizers and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean.
This week, the state television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry in the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
To this end, the persistent wrestling comes about the sneaking rate of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is intended to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the west.
The Russian Head of State certainly won a bonus in Ankara for calling for support for the chosen state bodies after the attempted state.
This is well-known for Moscow a self-consciousness that has a deeply seated fear of sharing regimes.
The summit in this glossy palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to represent one, as an analytic once described, "Alliance from outsiders": two countries who are disgusting and feel badly treated and now bonds.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
It could be significant that, after almost three hours of first talk, both Presidents at the press conference said that they had not even struck the issue.
The President of Turkey did not deliberately answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize it.
There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, as the NATO member of Turkey dismissed the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
The mark RBS is intended to be reduced to a backoffice roll, according to the Board of Directors of the Bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
Since then, the bank has distanzed when it had to be collapsed and saved almost eight years ago.
At that time, brand-strategen "RBS" used to protect other end-user financial marks.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Victor Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the exchange notation will change to NatWest.
The brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private customer business that will be given more importance - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit tour by customers and employees in Invernessshire.
He shared the BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy, as we now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue his Six Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in his sport sponsoring.
"It is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands, because how are we focusing inside (we have asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Governor.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can restart these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches its 3,000th profit at Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings it 3,000th profit
On Friday, the Jockey Frankie Dettori secured its 3000 British win at Newmarket.
He put on Prediction, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second profit of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened to Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 200,000 people.
I'm easy and very modest.
Dettori takes up the joy when he gets the victory at Prediction
Two Jockeys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-month winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-month Derby winner had 4.493 career victory
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of moderns and it is not surprising that he has reached this milestone that has only a few before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactic intellect that distinguishes him from the other in the weight control room.
He's been a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma enthusiasm fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already gained 6,000 if he weren't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been riding winners in GB for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the cover sign of the British Flach Racing for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of great tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had problems at first when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to confront and return to his best form.
And he's not at the end for a long time - Dettori has once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50th year of life.
Russian Putin fires Staff Chief Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has, indefinitely, released his Staff Chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest trust circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In an opinion of the Kreml, it is that Putin has "ordered Ivanov's release from his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidial Administration without any reason."
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's vice-president since 2012, was appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
In 1972, he was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn, and he completed the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message in Tokyo.
On the Kreml website, it says (in Russian) that he was later the Head of Protocol and Staff of Government Staff.
About his appointment he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your activities as Head of State in relation to legislative drafts and controls on the implementation of your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convincing?
This step made Moscow mystery weaving.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putins for a long time and works like him for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
As a staff chief, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on TV, both men claimed that the Stabschef was resigning for his own wish.
But in spite of the smile to the cameras, there are only a few of them convinced - especially now, just before Parliament's elections.
So is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
No one currently knows that.
But the official claim - that a man who was once advocated as a potential president - once wants to lead Russian environmental policy - was very skeptical.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kreml website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to trust me this very complicated posts - you could almost say - complaining posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been Chairman of the Russian Bureau for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was vice-president and defence minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin former member of the National Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his vice-president.
As Putin, he came to the power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he most trusted.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, since a third period of office of Putin would have infringed the constitution.
But this post was taken by another nearby alliance of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit the producer
Gibson was involved in a physical discussion last month in the set of series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, announced their cancellation in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, excused himself publicly on Thursday before his announcement.
At the set there were artistic differences and disagreements.
I regret the incident," he said in a message.
Details of how the character of Gibson is written from the series followed by a team of FBI agents are expected to be published at a later date, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who previously played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been involved since the first stage of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put my whole heart blood in the past twelve years," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but that will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can wish for a series.
The planned radiation of the twelve pillar is set on 28 September.
Puzzles about fish landing in the garden in Banff
A inhabitant of Banff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals spoiled out by a spring fountain.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacular in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: bridge now connected to fife
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed until May 2017
Engineers have connected the North Deck of Queensferry Crossing with the Viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected with fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "covers", which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20.000 tons of concrete as well as 46 scarlets.
The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed until May 2017.
Minister for Economic Affairs Keith Brown made a visit to the building site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.
He said: "It's a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering of a truly epical measure in this project with over 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the lock between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a soft activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for passing.
Overall, nearly 79% of the entire bridge covers are at their place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a betonous for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised on the bridge at its place.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future high and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road deck and its connection to the North Tower Deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by dragging the northern portable bridge 700 millimetres south.
This was a massive and at the same time very tender activity.
Massive, since the viadukt is 222 meters long, approximately 6,000 tonnes weighs and had to be pulled up at a rise of about 3%.
Hekel, as the tolerances on which the team worked were small - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Salvation in Moelfren Bay: Three men have "Luck still alive"
Three men have "luck still alive" after being thrown by their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfren RNLI rescue station hit on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfren Bay.
The three men had trouble swimming safely while their boat moved on with their own power.
"We saw how the boat turned around her and imagined the worst thing," said the leader of the rescue station of Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Happyly, the strong winds have already weighed the boat beyond their reach until we let water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found on a boje hanging without rescue.
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water did not hurt happiness and were still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency line, it dissolved himself from the person who was steering the boat when the boat was boiling.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
Heavily hurt - a man insists on his ex-friend
A man has attacked his ex-friend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and harmful injury.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized actors cut the clothes of his ex-friend.
When he came into the apartment, he went into her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on the hand and on the body.
The police were able to arrest the offender.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-friend's clothes, he called his mother.
This alarmed his sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-old wanted to calm down their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her companion.
On the street, they hit the man's ex-life companion.
When the two women joined the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to side and attacked his ex-friend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors will be much more committed in the future.
How do you respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "dwelling concept" for the next session of the Council.
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who is actually supposed to build the favourable apartments?
There is no regulation yet.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: If anyone wants to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments must be social apartments in the future."
However, the favourable apartments can also be in stock.
But the big issue in the Council Hall is, as Bratmann said, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as possible 20 percent of the apartments as social apartments."
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still need to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann, "There is currently no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants investors to make as few as possible regulations.
The left wants more hard orders for investors.
In spite of this, Bratmann said, the situation in the housing market was intensified.
If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff are needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the experts.
However, the programme is not entire: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
How, however, is the loss of further around 1300 favourable apartments, whose promotion will run out in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
In order to prevent this, as the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm said, outgoing bonds should now be bought from the city.
In addition, it would have to be thought of getting apartments back to the price bond.
This is possible in the West City.
The problem could be solved on a stroke.
For in the western city, the deadlines expire at the end of the year.
About 1800 apartments could be retrieved back to the price bond for cheap apartments.
Only: The owners, the housing companies do not want that.
Because the number of social dwellings in the western city is again drastically increased, one is removed from the objective of the so-called interfusion.
A concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city is no longer supposed to exist.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
President of the Group, Holger Herlitschke, says: "For a wide majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
They have concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses.
But what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness worth
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
That teenagers and children don't go out to play anymore, but rather prefer to spend their leisure with staring on screens, many have been complained over the past decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting active.
The time on the screen was at first on the TV, then limited to video games and last to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities outside are not excluded from each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s (seenly there was a drawing series, playcards and other spin-offs).
As many phenomena of popculture, the interest before publishing the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand was slightly lowered at the beginning of July.
The market introduction in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.
Within few days, Pokémon Go had more users than tinders and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they were found, can be "fotografed" (on a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "catched".
A generation that played the game when she was even younger joined the wrath and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person resigns every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days of the introduction of the game, the number of people trained 30 minutes each day, from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who of them plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for performance increase.
Many public education campaigns for health that people want to "take 30 minutes of time", "to come from the sofa" and "to be active every day" stood on deaf ears, because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look evil.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of being sick of cancer or depression.
Body exercise helps to control weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to introduce them here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunlight, and fun.
Some people even make new friendships on hunting.
Like always, there are magnifiers who must always complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What are you doing?
There was a breakthrough.
Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit had been able to follow our activity before, they gave us no reason to drive sports as this game does.
The New will lose his irritation and the use will leave with time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games to link the apps and virtual reality with the activation of the real world and help many people hunting to be active, flashing and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in the damenturn
Forget the pressure.
Forget the Hype.
Simone Biles is immune.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
It's hard on the bar.
Awesome on the ground.
It's brilliant in the whole line.
And now finally, too, Olympia.
The 19-year-old American tournament climbed on Thursday to the multi-fight title and increased the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the light of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62.198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and Final Five manshipmate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The American girl Simone Biles turns on the sweeping bar during the single merchandise of women in the art tours at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-fight title and totally the fifth, while fixing her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at this moment ended.
This success puts her in the same liga as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports types to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Girl of 1984 Mary Lou Redon said that she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a last review in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but between her and a load of overdimensionated expectations.
Not returning back with a handful of gold to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered as disappointment.
The American girls Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman are embraced after having won gold and silver each in the single multi-foundal of women in the art tours at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a call sign at the termination celebration of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles was on it, while her long way to the top, never planned the future, that is not really true.
Some of their soil exercises - which contain their typical tumbling passport - are agreed to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child, and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the Turnhalle, in which Borman trained.
She has lost no more battle competition since summer 2013, a victory series that will stop as long as Biles wishes.
Even though Mustafina led slightly through two rotations, the image was deceived.
Swing bars and ground towers - where cars hold the world championship title - laured.
She picked up again with 15.433 on the sewing bar - and put another one on the floor with a 15.933.
Raisman embraced her softly when she expected her ending - a pure formality - and tears flowed on Biles glossy red, white and blue eyelins, when the vision she once described in her collection book became real.
The performance of Raismans was a vengeance for the last four years ago when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal went in a tiebrake at Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old crew captain, called the American grandmothers, had a prompt.
After her soil exercise, she threw to the audience kissing hands, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As regards Biles, the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new significance:
Police: 3 victims shot in series murder cases when listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of the most fatal attacks for a decade in the first series murder of Phoenix while they talked in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The actor fired eight shots from a hand fire, while standing on the side of the car and then flew with another vehicle, is read in the report.
The police announced that the three-fold murder does not seem to have been the result of a robbery, because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2.900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to become a closer look at whether it was connected with four previous attacks.
Overall, mostly in hispanic residential areas, seven people were killed in nine attacks and two more injured within four months.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized and died later because of their injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the ground.
One Witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the three-fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial murderer.
Detectives found cartridges and secured a ball from the seat as well as sphere fragments from the engine space.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microzephalia: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like the least of his older companions, Edmund has microzephalia, the result of a genetic disturbance that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I can't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't give up for that.
What's wrong at all -- of course one's left on it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institutionalize him.
"My first answer was "I didn't know that people still do," explained Picciuto.
Edmund can run with the help of a walk.
Edmund could not sit or crawl up to his third year of life and he cannot still speak.
But he's making slow progress.
He can run with support and bike.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has thought out for "Sing something for me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microzephalia has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as massages or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts can vary significantly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't been asking for the forecast for a long time, because I don't expect her to really tell me someone.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zika virus.
It's gonna be better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding causes salvation in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and huge floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is estimated to be over with more rainfall all Saturday.
Many rivers in the southeast of Louisianas and the south of the Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with great floods after extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that government officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and help to the communities concerned is already on their way.
Mike Steele, a speaker for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for high watercraft, boats and sand bags increased.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sand bags.
A flood warning system is used over many parts in the south of Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain.
In the south of Alabamas, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the area of Mobile.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, will reach all probability after the weekend record level.
The meteologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could overflow many houses in the nearby Baton Rouge.
He also said that a flow downward flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these will flow over the rivers that have been hit slowly into the Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest position ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams still joined people from the river water in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his step son, were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that the water of Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, grew strongly overnight.
He said that another step son who lives nearby would have warned him.
"We woke up and the water flowed and streamed in," said Hansford.
It reached my valley.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years in which she lived there, she had never seen such a elevation of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were placed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had spread "happyly", since there was still heavy rainfall and that the authorities would hesitate to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer reported near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches of rain.
Krautmann said that the soil has been significantly accomplished by the rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that heavy rainfall and road floods caused the salvation of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and educational losses in five school districts.
The CBS daughter's servant WWL reported that a council in Tangipahoa had 200 overflowing houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, which were now both flooded.
The chief of the municipality Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pet animals that were washed by the high water.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were established to accommodate the evacuated.
"When the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back into their houses," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen roads were closed due to the high water and sand bags were provided for the inhabitants who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy des Harrison County said that it continued to rain on the golf coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses should have been reported as overflowed on Thursday, but no one has been reported on Friday until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "by balls hollowed", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child is shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents announced that Brown suffered several shot injuries, including in the lenden, legs, arms and abdomen, but he was aware of his carriage to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his small body was filled by balls," his grandmother Delores Melendez announced to the transmitter.
I just can't believe that.
The boy's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgery.
The family of the boy told the transmitter that he was expected to cure again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Similarly, three men were shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in a stable state according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical state, reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police just determined whether one of the injured men of the offenders could be injured.
Detectives informed CBS Philadelphia that there seemed to have been a crossfire between several protectors.
Cartridges for storm guns that were tracked back to various storm guns overlooked the site.
It seems that this has clearly been a continuous struggle.
On the road, on both sides of the road, there were hills.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," told the police officer Anthony Ginaldi of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There was no arrest and the police are currently checking reports according to the monitoring video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross-countryer on the arm when she played in front of her house in the vicinity of the West Oak Lane.
She gets back and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm imagining under the women's Olympia team in the tower and that for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been with every summer olympiad since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls with a different skin color.
The structure of this team, Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, rounds around, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female tournaments was an afro American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
This shows strength.
In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympia winner, and America rejoiced.
Now the world was able to be a witness to the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymastic routes.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Aly Raisman won silver.
We are experiencing the top of this sport, but that's how torque classes don't look throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all struck the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic Team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympia team will only have four tournaments in the team. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality looks like towers are an expensive sport and tournament is mainly in private tournament associations that are maintained by parents for the training, establishment, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their towers and families). The list can be continued anywhere.
The majority of these tournament associations are in prosperous premises that can support the business.
In these associations, the tournaments receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both her athletes since they started the tower.
We need to allow the communities for countless, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more affordable and easier accessibility to turn training.
I founded my 20-year tower foundation.
At my events, we offered free and affordable tour in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my home city) to offer youth high-quality tour that deserves the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and definiteness for the spirit.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health, educational and vocational success.
It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in turning and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's so exciting.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic crew gold and thanks, fashioned so many young girls with different backgrounds to begin to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to terminate the dispute on the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association's officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in a election rejected it.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract compulsoryly and said that the NHS was located in a "Nemandsland" and would be harmful for the employees and patients any further delay.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract which contains changes in night and weekend work to improve care at young times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Medicals last night announced: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will warm up the current occupational crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
For only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress must be made and the time is out.
The efforts made by the BMA to resolve the disputes by discussions were to participate in the government in opposition and sometimes in ear-beating silence.
This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had only made last month about that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, lift the force and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do so, then the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work fights.
The last strike at the end of April provided a suspension of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100.000 dates, since nurses and specialists were included to provide doctors on the strike mail chain coverage.
The Ministers had hoped to terminate the dispute on the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the British Medical Association's officials.
The BMA wants a better weekly remuneration for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS employees, urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work fighting measures do not achieve only the few, but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients, nurses and their families only anxiety, disaster and interruption."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Medicines and have responded positively to the concerns of prematurity and whistleving with the Ministry of Health and other Ministry.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as postponing, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a working time, training chests, mutual recognition of the educational plan, educational leave and gender-specific wage cases in medicine - was a sign of the seriousness of employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of compliance with the agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medicine after recommended by the authorities to give this more people for a longer period.
The anti-inflammatory medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease.
The medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS Regulatory Authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140.000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Cardiovascular infarctions and strokes are caused by collections of fatty materials in the arteries walls that form layers.
When the coating breaks out, it can cause a blood clot that stops the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
If the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the blood flow and stop the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
Persons who have already had a heart attack have a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The draft instructions by NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disasterous consequences."
The fear of a re-infarction may have significantly negative effects on the quality of a person’s life.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By a provisional recommendation by Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness causes electoral fraud to blossom in Muslim areas
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the occasion of a government report for corruption from the office
A culture of Political Correctness has led to the knowledge that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is clearly ignored, as a destructive government report revealed today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles is familiar with the police, electoral observers and councils for ignoreing evidence of electoral abuse due to "oversensitives to ethny and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of elections from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lockbands outside election cabins in order to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that choosers lead a certificate to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a elector has only to call his name and address.
The report suggests that non-removal ink should be put on a person's finger if it gives its vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.
Whistleblower should have more protection, says Sir Eric.
He urges the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by non-official committees or working groups.
"This does not only serve against electoral fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," he said.
The report was organised by the Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election scandal in the east of London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the official mayor Lutfur Rahman should be withdrawn after a Lithuanian of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way" and that he would have brought his critics to silence with Rassissmus and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman is supposed to have "had led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation with one person choosing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He said, in particular, alarmingly to the fraudulent choice of letters - in the older members of the Muslim community, he would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the conduct of licences to prove the identity
His report states: "As evidence was applied that pressure was exercised on protective members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to choose in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladesh background.
"There was anxiety that... state institutions would knowably have ignored such a behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnic and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists are editing letters to stop "money harvests".
The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires harder registration reviews to prevent the use of the electoral list for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask choosers for your certificate before the choice.
Use non-removal ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are elected.
A three-year limitation on requests for an automatic letter choice.
Prohibition of political activists to edit full letter choices and envelopes of letter elections.
The police will be empowered to set up blocks for election stations.
A legislative amendment which facilitates a prosecution for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksrepresentation Act 1983).
Photographic ban in electoral stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the election stations (except Wales).
Intensive training to ensure that employees apply the rule that electorates go to the election cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "awkward" that no criminal notice was made after the Tower Hamlet's case.
"The election court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his vice-president unnecessary for corrupt and illegal practices because of a Lithuania," he said.
It was known guilty of due to a number of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings.
It also criticizes the ineffective "abhak controls" of the electoral registration departments of the Council Houses.
Sir Eric said: "The court sentence in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of Parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and concealed spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Challenge for Kate's bike gangster and other famous double gangers of Olympia sporters in Rio
Fans of the Olympia 2016 in Rio this week were admitted to the French bike sportsman Pauline Ferrand-Prevot except for borders and bands, which proved to be an impressive double gangster of the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympionic this summer is far from the only athlete fighting gold that has his own famous double ganger - at least not if you can give faith to the social media.
To honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are at the moment flirting on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain similarity to Hollywood's fame.
Jäger and wolf: U.S. crew member in the arch shooting Brady Ellison, left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate's double ganger on the cycling track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain bow protector of the Twining of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The crew member of the U.S. crew in the arch shooting Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after seeing pictures that he sees incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the bow guard came to the madness of the social media and confessed that he has been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I myself do not see a great similarity, with the exception of face hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'm complimentary."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be more focused this year: the increasing similarity between the British broadspringer Greg Rutherford and the popular actress Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with her great, expressive eyes is supposed to be a double ganger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One walk higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "atletic version" of the inception actress
Another persistent comparison was drawn between the Tennisstar Rafael Nadal and actress Josh Hartnett, which has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun-browsed skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was attested by fans to the same "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong Women: Football Star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put into the room: According to this user there may be a reason for the similarity of the pair
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
Actually, the American football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smiles, which are almost identical to that of the actress Laura Linney and the Goldmedalin winner in the turn of Gabby Douglas, who shows her own beautiful, wide smile that is similar to Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologize for his statement that Chinese swimmers "a pig died"
Byron MacDonalds Analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr. 4x200m freestyle swimming stackes insisted on the CBC life transfer of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian transmitter CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "as a mov" and during the race "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was disabled when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming pool.
MacDonald, who had been brought to the CBS commentator team to give more "colours", could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like miff, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swamped the second stage of the swimming pool 1:57,79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Watchers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweete, "Have the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "has died like a pig?"???
The idiot didn't understand they were still on shipment."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-style swimming pool for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with many speaking to him
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC shipment, excused himself lively for MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on a swimming performance."
It was an unfortunately selected formulation, we're sorry that it happened."
CBC apologize at the end more than 90 times in the people who answered the noticed via Twitter
The commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his excuse for more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also excused himself quickly and issued a message.
We regret it sincerely that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be radiated.
We have apologize for sending and followers in the social media at our watchers last night.
To clarify one, Byron's comments refer to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inadequate and an unfortunately selected formulation. Byron is very sorry what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald excused himself in the consignment and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention that it was interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the female swimming pool in the CBC Olympic End, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intent and I'm very sorry."
Purchasers in Primark disturbed about woman who tested in the middle of the shop shameless underwear
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a prize to try underheads.
In order to make the situation worse, she mourned as she looked in it, she pulled out and put it back into the hall.
She continued and tried four pairs of underhoses in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.
The Primark Business at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tested the underhoses before she put her back to the hall
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she went back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a couple of underhoses from the excavation, pulled out her own trunk pants and pants and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discrete place to do it - she just stood there, frech like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she pulled out the underheads again, which obviously didn't like her, because she put them back into the hall."
She repeated the same thing with three other underheads before finally she decided that she did not like anything, retracted and went out.
"They didn't seem to interfere with the fact that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underheads she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take underhoses home that had another person and washed not."
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I received, the employees have tried to remove the clothes pieces from the sale after she went - what is equally good."
"I would hate to go home with a new couple of underhoses and find out that another woman had her and went out again and she wasn't washed."
A speaker of Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, 9 August in our branch in Folkstone."
All the products in question were withdrawn from the sale.
How to Protect With Requirements Maga from Arms Attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a major champion of the Requirement of Maga Verbandes in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers on close distance.
No matter whether you get closer to you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how you turn the spit around for your robbers.
When you approach you from the back, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the shot line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow in the face.
Then hit him with the knee in the bar and rotate while the attacker crumbs for pain, the gun out of his hands. Beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they direct the gun to him.
In attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and rotate it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
Move the weight on the gun at the same time and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of his handle before they move backwards and direct the gun to it.
Sounds difficult?
Look at the video to see exactly how it makes Mizrachi.
But remember that it is safest for a robbery to provide your money - unless you are not a requirement Maga Grandmaster.
Travelers Ian Wright can get his tongue to the most dirty places in Europe for a guide
A British traveler undermined his immune system and wurgereflex of a serious test by licking some of the most dirty and dirty places in Europe.
The fashioner and traveler Ian Wright, 51, made his trains from Suffolk on a Euro-Shine, a country at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.
Before cutting off every object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he'll take on.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Internal Strength" brought some surprising results to the day.
The idea of leaking off the washing button of a train toilet already used by thousands of others may be totally dissuasive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of darmbacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left behind what he swallowed, more than a bad taste in the mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public countries on railway stations to spoil buttons from toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a sample
In the movie, he said, "I was relatively unangry as a child as regards my health and I put all the things possible in my mouth, earth, worms and mud."
In the movie, he was justified in any case.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample decline showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak off after their luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producers of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Internal Strength", which shows the bacterial number in various places such as the bathroom
In the movie he says, "That's close to the worst thing I've smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to look at anything here because it's stupid in here.
The "The Lickhiker's Guide to Internal Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products of Valio.
The company is appointed by Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of darmbacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer the consumer something new.
Something fascinating to view and at the same time explaining the advantages of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstorms that ended by saying, "Lass us call Ian."
They claim that the interest in intestine health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put it in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestine health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added: "Let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had leaked some of the things that I had commanded him to leak like the ugly Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to make Ian look at them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we have filmed some of these dirty leakages."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all the milk acid bacteria examined were associated with the welfare of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they at least sometimes use products containing added milk acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before deloging social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A social family left her social housing after a delocation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing company found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls showed clapping holes, wooden particles were shaken, waste was scattered on the floor and grave fiti was smuggled on the walls.
The family has been resided and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to repair.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to take into account, as this property is likely to be considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is annoyed and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons living in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had encountered included street fights with baseball strugglers, intimidators, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive crying, disputes and curse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an arrangement for antisocial behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be cut off, old waste was found
In the site where drugs have been traded in the past, the wooden particles have been swallowed up
Neighbours said they saw them fight on the street and had to be called regularly to the police
Cornwall Housing deloged her and her partners this week violently from the property after she gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.
The delogy was delighted by familiar neighbors who said that their life was made hell.
One said, "They did not screw around nobody."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we say to the police here are incredible.
"Today tomorrow we couldn't sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - that's not usual!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Forcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have abandoned the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called regularly for 20 years
On the overwhelmed side of the municipality house, waste and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant forsumed to assume any responsibility for their behavior and family, since a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, since the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as the members of the community who have courageously approached us and have made us the information.
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the ground in one of the bedrooms of the house after disintegration
Workers of the House Management will now have to remove waste mountains surrounding the house
In 2014, the police carried out a razzia in the house and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as weights, parapherniles and cash amounts of £1.700.
Skeldon received a penalty after she had known the possession of a drug of class B in a commercial manner.
She claimed that the money for a grave stone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.
After they were without home, Tanya and her partner are expected to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were decorated with Graffiti.
The police say it's going to delegate renters who don't comply with the house order.
Angela Crow from Devon and Cornwall police announced that the delog is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the household order.
"This goes to those who think that they can behave without self-pronunciation as well as to those who have been damaged by such a behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior, which will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are paniced after a deep-flight military jet overlaps beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their life
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force Air Force Air Force plane an incredible crash flight
The air forces indicated that there was a training flight, but persisted that there was no safety risk.
This was the moment when anxiety tourists began to panic after a deep flying jet crashed down over a full beach.
Dramatic videos showed how the military plane flew almost in tangible proximity over the sun worshipers on the beach section of Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The vacationists jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the dish drives, without first seeing what came to them through the clouds.
The event took place yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidayers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By into the social media, said: "It was really flying very deep two times and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were paniced when the plane came out of darkness and incredibly flying deep
The Portuguese Air Forces today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats outside the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that due to the bad vision conditions, the jet was slightly deeper than usual, but the air forces persisted that security was not at any time threatened.
Area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese continent this summer, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deeply as a result of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his view
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Sevilla
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step to the first title win in the new football season.
The Catalans enter the duell around the Spanish supercup outwards against the FC Sevilla, the replay rises three days later in Camp Nou.

In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing to steps.
In the training, the German suffered a band disturbance in the knee, with which the enquiry at Barca was at least first explained in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean international and ter steps have been fighting for two years in Barcelona for the status as number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far rejected a clear decision and left Bravo in the liga, but Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first compulsory game of the new playtime, the Spanish Master doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test game by Liverpool with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 in the sample galop against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. were not really convinced to convince.
Sevilla has to devour the 2:3 downlay after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and strives the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is with eleven successes of the record winners in this application.
Ma Long in a own liga to Tischtennis-Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympiasiazer.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old in Rio de Janeiro defeated his countryman and "Title Defence" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4).
Thus, the world rankings first picked up the "Golden Grand Slam" with success in WM, World Cup, World-Tour Final Tours and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have done it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves.
So it was clear that for the third time in a row, a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic Tribe was the former SVS-NÖ Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the record alone, between the sentences and time-outs they had no coaches with themselves.
They had retired to the tribun and left their protectors in the fair competition alone.
"The matches until here I have played for my country."
"I play for myself in the finale," Zhang said folly.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners positioned with the China-Fahne.
The match itself was unexpected unilateral.
Mom had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Then he determined the speed on the plate and left Zhang there only 13 points.
Through the superiority of Mother, the expected dramatic match did not develop.
However, there was sufficient breathtaking ball change.
Mizutani won the game about bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4:1.
The White Russian had in his quarterly final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov injured ribs, afterwards in medical treatment, had to enjoy "lastly" with sheet.
The Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become in similar high table tennis ages of Olympia.
Donald Trump gives ′′ major problems′′ in the election battle
The leadership of the U.S. republics is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditional conservative state states, of their majority.
The president's candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former republikan Highburg Utah.
A rare moment in which the large-speaking and self-security multimillioner expressed anxiety as reported by correspondents.
After throwing 16 rivals from the race within its own Republican camp, the doubts on his success are now growing in the fight for the White House.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump to evangelical Christians he asked for support in important state such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Indeed, if false reports about his candidature, he reappeared his well-known media ceiling.
Republican Hochburgen wackeln
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June SurveyUSA survey, Trump and his competitor of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were similar.
Other institutions look forward to Trump, but not at the distance used for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be threatened.
In an interview by the transmitter CNBC, Trump answered the question how he wanted to stop Clinton's premarch again: "Genauso, as I have done so far."
And pushed afterward: This will be "being successful, or I will make a very beautiful, long vacation."
He does nothing but "telling the truth".
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correction, that is all right, then Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump Party is supposed to have threatened to strike money to support his electoral struggle, he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, you want to take the candidates of the Republicans for the Congress more under the arms.
Olympia: Trinity of fraud in baptism test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary Commission on the case.
Kenia's light athletes are threatening after the second doping deal in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt in a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenia sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee announced the immediate establishment of a disciplinary Commission in order to examine the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that the former Sprinter and today’s coach, John Anzrah, in the Olympic village, had given a urine test under the name of the 800 meter runner Ferguson Redich.
This was reported by the Doping Controllers by the team leader of Kenya.
The IAAF World Association asked the IOC for information about the case in order to endeavour its own investigations, an IAAF speaker informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will be evaluated," said an IAAF Declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and published himself as Ferguson Rotich, made the sample and signed," explained Kenias Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become over 800 meters in Beijing WM-vierer in 2015.
Four days earlier, the Kenyan Leichtathletics Delegation Head Michael Rotich had been distracted from the Rio games.
He's supposed to have informed athletes from his country of upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was supposed to have been arrested at Nairobi Airport when he returned.
Kenya has been under special observation in the IOC for a long time after many doping procedures.
When announced by the IOC more than 2000 doping target controls before the Rio games, it was unusually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being taken to the list.
The world anti-doping agency had exercised much pressure on the African country before summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a working control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia start.
As a result, the WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping fighting is in line with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a large runner nation.
The country's light athletes won most of the medals at the WM 2015 in Beijing.
In a number of TV reports of the ARD, it has been repeatedly claimed that there is easy access to Kenia Doping funds and there is a significant mentality of sport fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in the Russian light athletics.
It could be demonstrated that in this sport, there was a surface-wide and systematic dipping.
Russia's light athletes were excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Mary as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical acquires Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's Masterwerk.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classics and fulfilled with the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the leadership of the venezonal dirigent Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swarms.
We always say she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their speed and melody.
It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
Bartoli plays an older Mary in this scenario.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
Firstly, because she is musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So it is wise, of course naive, and very passionate.
"It looks very similar to me, my Italian character I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She is an incredible generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Dirigating is a need for him.
You see it in every movement, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion, and also a joyful approach to life, which is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" high-current: "In this piece it is about prejudices and fanatism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York inhabitants did not want them.
These are the same topics, and they are as pronounced today as then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the ballwork of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died according to information from her family shortly after she planned to leave the war-bowed country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and a warning to others that this is the risks associated with going into a war area - people will not ever take this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from the east of London entered a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus at the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was informed that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within few months.
Reid says Clinton will stay in the case of a election victory at Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Senate Democrats, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garlands' confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader at Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next President will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
On Thursday during a telephone conference, Reid said that he expects Garland to select "with a certain degree of certainty".
A Reid speaker later said that he hadn't talked to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and speculate.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't cause anxiety with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the US Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the nomination of Garlands, was Lacay and helper of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the President's office.
Treats wants naked calendars for "women and for men"
The Treats Magazine works with the photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 70's Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
The Chefredakteur of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine differs from old school playboys as "Playboy is for men".
I'll do this for women.
Apparently he believes that the calendar does.
"We have to return to the representation of timeless and classical nakedness, where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these pictures of a female body," said Shaw in a press release to publish the calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally on open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality calculated with mass flight
"He who doesn't adapt and praise Erdogan is sitting on packed bags," says the Chairman of the Golden-Night Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karacoyun.
The Kurdish municipality Germany is expected to have tens of thousands of protective seekers who fled from Turkey to Germany.
In the medium term, it could even be "one hundred thousand", believes the Chairman of the Association Ali Toprak.
Due to the hard course of the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan after the Putsch trial, the Kurdish municipality Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, medium-term with some hundred thousand seekers from Turkey in Germany when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and democratic opposition," says the Federal Chairman Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday.
Because the government had already transferred Kurdish Highburgers with criminal action months ago, 500 000 Kurds were refugees within Turkey.
After the ruined push, still secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state who takes up refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The Federal Head complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitian cities.
So Erdogan wants to increase the excursion pressure on the remaining Kurdens.
"They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or disappeared in the past hundred years," said Toprak, also a CDU member.
The Chairman called for the Federal Government to "pose as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers".
In Germany there is also a "hexenjagd" against Erdogan critic.
I don't feel safe in the last months for the first time in Germany.
The German branch of the Gulen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will search for asylum in Germany, especially Kurden and Oppositional.
The brand marking as a golden attacher destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Whoever does not adapt and praise Erdogan, is sitting on packed bags, also the chemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karacoyun, Chairman of the Golden Foundation Dialog and Education, the "World".
As reported in the newspaper on figures of the Federal Ministry, the Turkish represented the largest group of asylum lawyers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the Putsch.
At the 30th of June, these were 11.386 people and thereby almost 29 percent of all asylum-justified (39.625).
In this survey there are not those who fled before war, poverty or perspectivelessness.
Asylum law under the basic law is exclusively political, that is, from the state side, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go where it hurtut"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommers: The locals don't get anything from the summer game - and the holidays from Nordrhein-Westfalen are not allowed to choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommers they understood.
In 2021 the country-day election will not take place directly at the end of summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's more stupid than so far: summer holidays, heat and land day elections - that's bite.
The locals who are to be convinced by the electorates are on vacation.
The most of the vacations in the country, on the road to usedom, Rügen, or Hiddensee, are not residents, therefore, are not allowed to choose the country day.
Practical problems: In the holidays, helpers are hanging up, blowing up airballons, spreading airplanes, and counting voices at the end, only struggling.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must have almost overcome the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just started.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
Excitingly, how strong newling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition stunning thing.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Head of Government, has a nearly unattended election struggle, is seen from its large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and ploughs a little with the people, as it did his legendary wortkarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff.
Otherwise, the soul ring has got cold feet and gives the mayor Merkel the blame for the bloom of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, you "We can do this" has accelerated the rise of legal populations, which is likely to cost him the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidates, the Inner Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make elections at the right place at the wrong time.
She has invited Kanzler Angela Merkel twice to large customers; Merkel's Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berliner and Saxony there than Mecklenburger and Vorpommers.
"There was probably the majority of other federal countries," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it also harms no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU is largely abstaining from the usual election stands on markets and before shopping centres with sunscreens and airballons.
That's what Cooker says, just play a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that it breaks the base on the country, that it has to work very hard to find a wire to the people again.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the broadness of the country hardly exist.
However, the CDU fighter's advice Cookert on his fellow fighters is also self-explaining: "You must go to where it hurts, namely where people are: villages, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used."
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly engaged electoral struggle.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just near the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had still won with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, are supposed to create the jump in the country day.
They make a modern virtue from the holiday note and mostly move their electoral struggle to the Internet.
"Online whale struggle", it calls the national president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green electorates are looking for local voting citizens among the vacationists.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is just curved with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and still enjoys it.
Her impression: "Wahlurlaub in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is no penalty".
B27-surcharge: Guest sites suffer from locking
At the speed with which the B 27 is cleaned, there is nothing to be softened.
For those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.30 p.m. and ends only at 20 p.m., there is half praise.
"They've made everything pretty tricky," says Elvira Tetzlaff about the jet tank station.
It's a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site was able to be scheduled to move to the south until the end of October.
It is also praised that the remuneration of those responsible for construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of helping intakes.
Since the construction site has changed to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Asperg Road in oftendingen has also been suspended and thus the connection to Rottenburg has been re-encountered, the transport situation has relaxed within the place.
Citizens are now able to return from often the B 27 to the two sides.
There seems to be a backward movement through the place.
"There were some significant complaints," says the vice-president Florian King responsible for transport management of the restoration.
The inhabitants of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain were fighting with more trailers, because many of them were searching for trails and familiar with their Navi rather than with the description.
What caused some trucks to be seen in residential areas.
As the speed limits were also not respected, the municipality called for the measurement vehicle from moussing.
"There were significant overrides," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation.
There have been two to three blits per minute.
The fastest was travelling with 77 kilometres in the speed-30-zone.
Since the construction site has continued, it has become quieter.
For business people at the B 27 it is only a little comfort that the street is open for customers from Rottenburg.
The cards do not like business people.
But that the B 27-surger has led them to turnover infringements, lets everyone that is asked look through.
However, some are more affected and some are less affected.
Whoever has less to do with the "endkunds", thus produces for other companies, for which the revalidation has little consequences.
At the Mayer car house, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight fall", but also admits that of course "the course is missing".
The strongest pouched are the locals along the street.
J. Albert Göner, owner of the Steakhouse, former Krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all guest places hit it "hearted".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The fines of turnover are "wide over 50 per cent".
The road announcement has thrown its operation back "in two years".
Half of his employees he had to leave.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, the politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, President-in-Office Jörg Schmidt responded to a request by Günner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the point that the guesthouses otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27. Now they must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the restoration.
Günner knows from other landscapes, where such a generous thing was handled.
For all complaints, Günner is sure that his guest place will remain.
Finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, referring to the long history.
The fact that other tribal guests are less frequently overlooking because of the complicated transportation, he can understand.
If you can't get out of here, it's pretty somewhere else.
That his tribal clients come back after the end of the rehabilitation work, Gohner has no doubt about that.
Despite the crisis with BSE and bird grips, Günner believes the impact of the B 27 construction work on his customership for the biggest crisis that his guesthouse has experienced in its long-term history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
In the name of terrorist fighting, laws are constantly screwed.
After the recent attacks, Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what has a tolerance status to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say to all of that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the son-in-law.
All his proposals are "politically acceptable" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister in the imagination of his new security package.
You don't demand anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved.
As a minister of the Interior, however, he was on results and on a "real consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has allowed him to leave a little while before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now far more profound.
Some things are already known, announced, suggested that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communications is not new.
Even not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU rules on passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
Partly, de Maizière starts a second approach to proposals that have not been made with the SPD until now: he wants to punish sympathetic recruitment for terrorist groups and Djihadists with double citizenship to knock off the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
However, he considers this to be acceptable and does not demand anything that has no chance for the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas also present the Maizière.
They have it partially in itself: He plans quick procedures for disposing and more possibilities for imprisonment of people before disposing.
Refugees who are targeted to the country should have their smartphones checked in advance and social media accounts for a safety review.
In the case of duplications for rejected asylum applicants, he wants to make some worse than so far - such as those who commit criminal offences or discard their papers consciously in order to diminish their identity.
Some of them are political and legally soft.
Some things still seem unequivocal and leave questions open.
And on some points - for example in the treatment of patience - the question is: What does this really have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, de Maizière says it is important to differ between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it can't be said that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high rates of refugees.
And things that people deeply occupied weren't even possible in electoral times.
The internal security is enormously focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is big.
And yes, there are election fights.
The Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in the field of internal security.
In the last few days, there was a rise between the two parties.
Only a serious dispute on the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security policy idea collection of some Union ministers, in which the Heads of Ressorts also demand a Burka ban and a departure from the double citizenship.
De Maizière also strives here for reconciliating tones.
He doesn't hold anything from a departure from a double passport.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Open it up again, don't be meaningful.
And in the case of a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "permissible" for the coalition partner, it has to be shown.
It's some of the things that could cause dispute.
But also the SPD is currently trying to profile in the field of internal security.
Head of the Party Sigmar Gabriel first signals careful conversation willingness and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security."
People's cars are still shining through.
Despite diesel candals, the delivery numbers increase worldwide.
But not all markets are running around.
In the callback action there is a term of spin.
Volkswagen starts at the delivery of more behavior in the second half of the year.
Europe's largest automobile builder can continue to present a plus in the past year, despite the diesel business thanks to its many brands and some well running markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again charged the total sales, as the company listed in Dax announced.
Worldwide, the brand VW sold 1.8 per cent less vehicles in July with 449100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market Germany, the delivery was sucked by almost a six-six-stage.
The trademark manager Jürgen Stackmann brought the weaker figures from July, especially on two sales days, less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, "changed economic conditions" have led to a rescue of purchases.
In addition to the situation around the punish trial in Turkey, a speaker explained that the British vote was burdensome for EU exit.
In the United States, where the exhaust shop first escalated, there is also a minus to book.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the most affected homemark of the Lower Saxony continues glimpsely through the Diesel Candal: after the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 per cent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler could continue to present a sales plus from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered trucks at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust test.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for re-equipment to the workshops.
During the restructuring, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
In the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power, no deterioration occurs after the re-establishment of the vehicles.
The autobuilder issues a "guarantee equal" certificate after the reconstruction, but does not speak of a "guarantee" as it was called in business circles on Friday.
Reasons are jurisdiction.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen has now given his German customers a guarantee for reconstructed diesel models.
This would have confirmed last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
From the Ministry of Transport, it was confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my investigation Commission and of the KBA."
"Deviations of these are not accepted," explained Federal Traffic Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that there are no deteriorations in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after re-equivalence and all type-approval-relevant vehicle values remain unchanged.
Volkswagens themselves use the term "Garantie" but not as it was called in business circles.
With the wide term "Garantie" Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, customers get to a workshop for a half year after the reconstruction, for example, with a motor damage - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the interests of customers to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the candal of exhaust gas comes into an uncertainty with regard to possible guarantee schemes, as it said.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "Garantie".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at the Tegernsee requires rich spare interests in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Head of Bank Joseph Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on giro or day money accounts."
The Federal Association of Deutsche Banken speaks of a single case and does not see a signal therein: Normal savings should not be afraid to pay for their spare rates.
Stocks Banks Money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 per cent fine.
This fee requires the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September on private and business customers for deposits over 100 000 euros on giro or day money accounts.
"The first 100.000 euros are free."
"The next 100.000 costs 400 euros a year in future," Paul said.
He has been guarding for 40 million euros since time, which could be raised from one day to another and which he could not recover.
"They are on my central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs," said the bank manager.
"I can't spend $4000 for every million."
He will now continue to pay the costs according to the contaminant principle.
The cash would be too dangerous to leave in the barbecues of the Raiffeisen Bank: "I've already experienced four attacks, I don't like the fifth!" said the bank manager.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Just a few walked down to other banks.
The Bayern Association explained: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks".
To carry them alone, be "intensively not possible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalties for deposits from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made lists with its tax banks in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, the principal business manager of the banking association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay flat-shaped charges for deposits, for this the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong."
One banker said that at the Tegernsee there was "a client who is a little more luxurious from the property".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if she keeps money free of charge.
The 1911 founded cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Familiar actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The Bayern Association of Cooperatives "is currently not known for any other banks calculating a deposit remuneration for private customer deposits," said Speecher Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had explained at the end of June: "The threshold to go into negative to the private customer is very, very high."
The competition is hard, and it threatens the migration of investors to competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in the width.
Destination plates: who actually buys sound records?
Single men of the middle age love records.
Before you move to the comment part to oversee him under the pseudonym NotAllSingleMännerMitlerenAlters with cruel insults, this statement depends on current data.
According to YouGov, the highly discussed resurrection of sound plates is not on a tree in Millennials that wants to welcome the news of physical items, but is due to midlife nostalgie.
Those who have recently bought a record are all foreseen in the age of 45 to 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older plate buyers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a business street in Soho, wear a modest grey suit and steal wild before I stand, hold my hands and say something decisive like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho slowly boasts into his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which one-time independent sellers were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic record special shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part where I stand in the immediate vicinity of various men in such businesses and try to evaluate their age and mind by observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men in the middle age) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men in the middle age, a woman, probably around 20), is one day because of a meeting in London and goes through the business to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, am I asking?
"I guess," he said.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), clothes the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he couldn't afford when they appeared and buy again items that he sold when he was young and pleite.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably too young to buy them," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meet apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and were motivated to buy their old records again.
Of the conversations I have conducted, people have usually dismissed their collection by 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain the tree to attachers of the record revival of a given age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognize that record business offers a relaxing community of equals.
According to Wez, some of the older customers incited the contactless payment system.
Some plate fans feel overwhelmed from the digital world and want to withdraw themselves to the stability of familiar soundboard caves, to wake up objects that bring happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of an empty or the possession of material possessions than a kind of comfort," says Wez.
That's what I am as a collector, and I think it's the same with many people.
It's a simple way to occupy spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" a employee flows out of a record pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player that they never use, while 7% of those buying a record do not own a record player.
At this time of the news report, I'd probably look very worried when I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of medium age), has noticed a "dropheena-aspect" of the Revival.
"Nobody just came in here recently and said, "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead sound record so I can put it in the hall," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More product-loading, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated to the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a bunch of audience when I went in.
There are pairs around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenagers and women in the middle age.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned businesses - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz put from the speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers.
None of them look very lonely, but nearing psychiatric traumas are difficult to find if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes and looks at the variance of the plates to be sold.
She's making a show window bubble rather than a big shopping.
It does not deserve much, so the collection of discs is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of records is..." she drives off with a loved sucker.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of plate lovers should have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to make the Jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley plate player.
To the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at her - perhaps because they're just decorative, some so far above that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "Plattenkunst".
But in view of the fact that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is not surprising that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one who spends most for luxury items such as records.
Even if my research showed that the results of YouGov were voting, they, at least in record businesses in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record business and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.
They don't spend their Thursday tomorrow safely with the bulbing through record businesses of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while avoiding the staring view of an unhearted 30-year-old false moder that is not going to be over the shoulders of a mean age.
The Greenland Hai is the longest living whirlpool - video report
Scientists say that the Greenland hai has the longest life span of all the vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studied Haie, says that the record was at a female, from which it was assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French Court rejects the offer of departure of shops in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer from the authorities in Calais to defeat dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.
At a judicial trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be empowered to deprive 72 provisional transactions where people inside the warehouse sell from cigarettes to energy drinks, freezer services or tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or simple meals for a few euros in preliminary restaurants.
The prefectur Calais argued that these places should be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that would pose a fire and sanitary risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the Court that shops and restaurants were important, since the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also indicated that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the excretion of people who operate the 72 provisional transactions, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely detectable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food businesses, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who live "in extreme precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the Lower Rise was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is being operated in a memorable manner and offers 200 meals on the day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unrelated minors in the camp.
More than 170.000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids' café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure "was a disaster for these children, of which the last eight years have been old."
On Friday, the two help organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated that the number of living in the jungles was increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steady increase in newcomings during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time ride, Radprof Tony Martin does not want to be undermined.
"I continue to keep the WM in view, remain confident and fight on," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable twelve place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on the time riding of yesterday," said Martin.
He must analyze in calmness what reasons would have led to Debakel.
At the time ride WM in October in Qatar, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
"I'll look at everything we've changed in the past."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-month world champion who lost more than 45,5 km on Wednesday on Olympic Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siemund misses semi-finale
The victory of Laura Siemund ended in Rio's quarterly final: The metzing World Arrangements-32. missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the half-final of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Shemund, which was plagued by backing problems, could only carry out its revelation once and did not act powerfully compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Medal Hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) had the chance of jumping into the lock round.
The Australian-Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (nr. 10).
As the last German tennis professor, Tommy Haas had taken a medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB-starters in the quarterly final of summer games had been present last 1992.
A German duo was never found in an Olympic single halffinal.
Groups increase at start-up for live video games transfers
Looking at other people when playing video games, is a giant center - of which also wants to benefit Microsoft.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specialized in this hobby.
How much money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and has already more than 100.000 users.
You can look at others while playing, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions and face enemies and provide equipment.
The player's Activision Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the thriving world of the e-sport.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is intended to help.
The advertising industry is already watching.
The employees of the start-up, which has his seat in Seattle in the US state of Washington, move to the Microsoft headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founders and Chief Matt Salsamendi announced.
Consequently, for customers, the acquisition should not change anything.
Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console according to Microsoft.
The market of the live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 by the online dealer Amazon - for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Forcement Trailer
Germany's Raser has to set up to the next generation speed measurements: in various federal countries, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new lightning devices are tested that are particularly effectively intended to transfer temporal sinners.
For example, the futurist-acting forcement trailer of Vitronic company from Wiesbaden can be used at accidental gravity points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway buildings or to clean bridges with temporary tempolite, there is often no infrastructure necessary to ensure that the speed limit is met with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or exhaustive.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds in an uninterrupted measurement operation five days, the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem.
In addition, with laser measurement technology, all vehicles can be collected over multiple traces at the same time.
Variable speed limits as well as time-limits, driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-speed state, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with a trailer.
In order not simply to be stolen, he is lowered in the measurement operation, so that the wheels are disappearing in the parked and, by the way, also shot-safe outdoor shelf.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the lightning from vandalism.
The trailer has been tested and used since 2015, according to the information provided by Vitronic in various federal countries.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France has recently ordered 100 pieces after a order of 150 pieces last year.
Great Britain picks up silver in the 7rd Rugby after Fiji MasterClass picks up gold
The impressive performance of the Great Britain at the 7th Rugby came to an abrupt stop at the last hit in the form of the Fijis at the final Thursday evening when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave a master class in handle, side-stepping, retrofing, line run and royal power to win gold - their first Olympia medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad comfort price of the silver medal - the fourth of Britain this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the box, 7-5 in the semi-finale on the same day could fall back on it in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have struck a 15-man team in best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fiji's chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind.
Eight years ago she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
Here they only lost one.
This slope will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs go out of fun.
It felt like captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were running in driving buses. The World Series winners went up to 5-00 when Osea Kolinisau heated in the corner.
With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai made another attack from the right corner he converted.
12-0 and GB have hardly touched the ball.
A great takle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nakarawa to reach a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new since the reappearance and there was still over a minute of play ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou predicted by further weak tackling of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learns about it.
That's the way it's done.
GB carried out basic changes in half-time and closed the fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed through after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long passed for the South Sea Islands, whose fans sang, swing flags and danced on the triboon.
It was not difficult to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame set the i-dipple with another attempt in the last seconds.
The pheiff sounded, the Fijis embraced themselves and GB sparked destructively in the ravens.
Earlier on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finale with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a little semi-final match from the race - the UK transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and reached a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by struggling with the cancer of the trainer to rude victory
There will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that's what's supposed to be.
From the first hit to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which enters into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional importance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two who were sitting at the rod, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they went to the second Olympiagold in the two, without taxes, the first women in the history of British sports that laid such a measure.
Her dominance was absolutely, after all, her 39.th unmarried use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who glide over the surface with the elegance of chicks, which does not reflect the type of triumph to gans.
Behind every gold in the rod is a battlelon on willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference and it was no more helpful than the trainer who knew not whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed cancer.
As he said he was risky.
I had blast cancers that are operational and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It's changing the view a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he could start his treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which would hold the interruption to a minimum if it was in such circumstances at all the right term.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
It is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediateness of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking something more than else and trying to deal with his own anxiety.
Stanning, who was chief at the Royal Artillery Regiment in an effort in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It repeats just how much that means me how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be anybody, so a massive thank you to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not cope with.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to open, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "bliv in the process, stay in the process".
It's really important not to get involved.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking for doing something great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a time for a year before it will make decisions on its future.
Glover must appear on a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic Girl.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years, a model of clarity
The manager of the water purpose group "Veitenstein Group", Ruppert Göller, is retired.
The association is considered to be "exampulated in a wide range of bayers".
A small French drinking water combination as an example for the large water producers.
So it was in the original tone some time ago in a contribution from the Bayerian broadcast.
Little later, the water forum of the government of subfrancs appreciated the purpose of the association.
The work of the Veitenstein group was considered "example as an example" throughout the world.
Behind all of this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years of employee, stands 28 years as manager.
He was now adopted in retirement at the age of 65.
The Vitenstein group's drinking water combination with its seat in Kottendorf, Breitbrunn municipality, promotes about 150000 cubic meters annually and provides 32 places and Weiler with approximately 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach.
For other cities and communities there are water supply contracts.
The current Chairman, Breitbrunn's Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was suspended as a water guard in 1985 and was already appointed manager of the purpose association in 1988.
"Their tasks have been very widespread and have been extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities, budgeting, calculating fees and contributions to emergency efforts in weekends," said the Chairman.
As an outstanding event, she called the entry into service and dedication of the new fountains (1994), the sale of land in the field of new fountains (1998) and the compensation of farmers, the renewal of high vessels (1999), the renewal of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has not been any stop and you have repeatedly taken up innovations because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio, she praised the faithful, reliable and correct service of the goddess over 31 years.
He used with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he lived the water purpose association regularly as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction before the water forum of the district underfrancs.
He has received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller praised Alfons Griebel, who worked 28 years with him.
He's the best water guard and he was a faithful button.
Together, we were an unsuccessful team.
As highlights from his viewpoint, he described the well-building and restructuring of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use were, however, the broken pipe on the high container at Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees, it will work throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn has been maintained only once because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water company was handed over to Daniel Stormer from Lauter, who joined the succession of Rupert Göller.
The sopranos Anna Netrebko is open to the Autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was recognized with her son, she believed that she had to die.
But in the meantime, the eight-year-old Tiago had come well forward and now learned privately in New York, where it was the best therapists.
"To give an example: If I ask him what is two years behind when I sang to the Mailander Scala, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection to Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Bargteheide - Man shoots on companion
A 35-year-old man shot on Friday at 10:45 a.m. in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Creis Stormarn) on his partner and injured her mortally.
"The man called himself to us and indicated that he had shot his companion," said a police speaker.
The acter is on the escape, after him is made public.
Meanwhile, Sven S. could be on the road with the car.
The man is about 1,80 meters tall, muscular, brown, and has a glacier.
In the meantime, the police have published a photo of him.
It's a few years old, however.
Meanwhile, the man is wearing a glat.
I don't want the man to be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun, so the police.
Whoever sees Sven S. is supposed to call 110.
The police are talking about a relationship state.
The victim was the year 1988, the actor in 1981.
The competent police in Lübeck did not first want to make any information about the tatherway or the relationship between actors and victims, but she confirmed that a man had been killed.
"It's a killing crime."
"More we don't say at present," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special operation command (SEK) was at the site.
Steel - Light View for German steel industry
Crisis-bounded and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs to millions.
Financial burdens threatened by the sector from the economism funding are from the table.
It remains in liberation of the renewable energy environment in the stocks for the so-called self-stream production in the German steel industry, said Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "West-German General Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really pleased that after two years of negotiation, we could finally reach the negotiations."
The European Commission had therefore first planned to ask the steel producers, which use the gases from the high oven for electricity production for their own consumption.
The steel industry threatened additional costs of EUR 120 to EUR 240 million per year, according to the German industry association.
Gabriel said to the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEC environment of 20% falls.
But these are not also raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on electricity production.
The status Quo of the existing scheme is thus largely determined.
The success of Gabriel's efforts for the steel industry is particularly important.
"In terms of our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"More have to follow."
"In the context of the reform of emissions trade, climate and employment targets are to be considered," explained the IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacities and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation was further intensified when the world's largest producer country China was thrown into the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand for mass steel.
European manufacturers propose price dumping from Chinese steel groups.
During this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
Firstly, import duties on imports of steel have been shown, and secondly, economic prospects in China have increased.
It is unclear how sustainable the recovery of prices is.
The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Lastly, prices would have been stable again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not last want to exclude closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, about 86000 people were busy at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel producers remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders.
They produced a total of six percent less raw steel by 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous month, as reported by the Economic Association of Steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now decreased in the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been below the previous year value by two percent.
In the coming months, the Association expects an improvement in the contract with a rising outlet.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing is good for the elderly
The singing has accompanyed Ursel Kipp her whole life: As a young girl she was in school, she was in the teacher's college, and today the 78-year-old sing in a senior chor.
"Sing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, joyful and totally more alive, she says.
Besides, she does something good with her health and spirit.
For singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with equally-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.
By regular consensus, seniors can narrow and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve at age, then a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Take up and organize, rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of consensus."
Sing can be tough in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because in this case, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Whoever demands his lungs regularly, even in everyday life, does not run out of the breath as soon as possible.
Even if it is about maintaining the sound of the voice in the age, Singing is an optimal hobby.
In the elderly, Sing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Community of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz frequently observes that the singing or hearing of songs in older people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Song texts and especially melodies mean that people who suffer from demensic illness have come from long backcoming events.
At singing, a special performance is also requested to the head, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - that is a great cognitive challenge.
Just older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition that is gained by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The self-feeling also grows by singing in the choir.
To show yourself: If I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.
So there's enough reasons to start singing.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby shouldn't hesitate - even if he thinks to have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes over?
In looking for the suitable offer, the elderly has different options, says Hackler.
Sing someone from the acquaintance in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also provide overviews of the chores in the area.
Whoever wants to sing in a church choir can direct contact the church or the church leader.
Many seniors can also be found via the Internet.
If you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in Internet search.
Whoever wants to sing, should join a choir, Hackler advises.
Sing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats respond more sensitive than cater to the crying of the young animals
Biologists in Hannover have examined the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miau didn't even make the males cold - but they always did the same as the females.
Female cats can identify the excitement rate of cat babys at the Miauen of the little ones.
They respond about ten percent faster to sounds of cats who are in great need, as scientists from the veterinary university and the medical university Hannover (MHH) have discovered.
Catherine also responds to the call of cats - but always the same.
"Of course, the acoustic differences between the mileage of less and strongly generated young animals are either unobservable for males or not of importance," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and height of the cats are different with the urgency of their need for assistance.
Overall, nine adult caters and eight cats were observed from the preservation of the MHH.
They were played as a call of little ones who were taken out of the throwbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with crying by stronger cats, which were further raised.
The researchers consider their results to be prominent despite the low sample.
"All females, even those who had no own adults, reacted differently to the cry," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call played the very more evil cats.
This ability may be inborn or develop with gender maturity.
"A surprise was that the males responded at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have examined the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski attacks with "Gala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükur is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a arrest order was adopted against the first football star Hakan Sükur.
He is condemned to be a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the punish trial, an important football game will take place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the arch rivals between Bevisas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly: "Business as usual" is stated.
In the event of an exceptional situation after the crash attempt in July, the government was not to impede the everyday life of normal citizens.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethulah Golden, which is made responsible for the pursuit.
There is also no stop before the football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükur, the prosecutor declared a arrest order.
Thus, the surgeon that lives in America is now predicted to be a member of a terrorist group.
Sükur is supposed to be the follower of the Preacher Fethulah Gülen, who is made responsible for the punish trial by President Reep Tayip Erdogan.
Although the exceptional condition for 90 days is still valid until October, it actually affects the life of most Turks as well as no effects.
The nightly "democracy wakens" on public places throughout the country declared Erdogan ended on Wednesday.
Sports - like the whole country - is divided into trailers and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the Worker Club Bevisas are traditionally not among the friends of the President.
What the large of the Turks is, however, in view of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military pants.
Even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart hits Galatasaray or Bevisas.
In Pokal Sieger "Gala" it will come to Luke Podolski again.
His sports value proved the Cologne during the end of the season: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first playtime as the top scorer of his association.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he reached the 1:0 winner.
The newspaper "Fanatik" rejoiced him: "He was the best in place."
He has completed the season in excellent way and secured his team the Pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season found a reconciliating conclusion for the record champion.
After the pre-running K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also came out early in the Europe League.
In the Süper Lig it was only to rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The pokal was the only way to win something.
"We have done this and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
The game year was better for Master Bevisas.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasonal meetings, set the base on the 14th track as a Super-Lig-Torschützen King.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In doing so, the contracted and borrowed Gomez on the AC Florence had only announced after the punish attempt to not return after its EM leave because of the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" club manager Fikret Orman.
To this end, the storm would have to be prepared to dismiss about one third of its estimated annual salary of EUR 7.5 million, Mr Orman stated: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These athletes still have Medal Chanses at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already blocked twice for Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other transmitted light athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The topic of Doping continues to determine the slogan lines in the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who, after a doping locker, had complained about her right of start shortly before the games, was excavated and excavated at her start (100 metres of breast).
There was a scenario of scenario: She was still proud in the hall and had provoked her appearance with a pleasant smile.
When she found that she wouldn't get gold, the audience broke out into a joyful storm.
However, there are many more athletes who, despite the doping past, start the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here's a overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staffel/USA): The 34-year-old belongs to the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He was already blocked twice for Dopings (2001 and 2006 until 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympiazer and ex-world champion runs even faster than before, he is more than 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaica): The two-month Olympic Girl and seven-fold world champion had to put a six-month locker in 2010 after she had been proven to take Oxycodon.
After surgery, she had strong dental pain, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatien): 2011, the Olympic Girl of 2012, World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested on the forbidden stimulants center of methylhexanamine.
Perkovic struggled with the knowledgeful intake and was locked six months.
The four largest throws this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staffel/USA): The Beijing Olympiasian and two-month world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and 21 months were locked.
A means of penis enlargement had been responsible, Merritt devoted.
This year, the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 m of the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): hardly one athlete was known as so many medals.
Thus, Tichon lost his WM title of 2005 nine years later after his testosteron-doping was found.
In the meantime, the 40-year-old had to deliver Olympia silver in 2004 for steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 for testosteron misuse.
He also received the bronze medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 due to a judgment of the International Sports Court of CAS.
With 80.04 m, he is on rank two of the world's rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The World Recorder and Gold Favoritine were tested positively only in May, but still may start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion has found evidence of the intake of a prohibited supplementary food, the locking of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mildly and ended on 13 July.
Bomber in Thailand - Austriar injured - More Dead
The Austrian message in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She suffered cut wounds and had been treated in the hospital, but she has already been able to leave this again.
Her home trip planned her for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the Phuket island and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to Schnöll.
Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok's capital, was first exploded in two bombs on Thursday night in an outdoor quarter.
According to the police, a Thai country was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosions were then raised, according to the authorities, another man was killed.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the early.
A taxi driver was injured after the detonation near the popular bath beach Patong.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a city employee.
According to the authorities in a flower bed before the district of the coastal police, the explosion was in the air.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang at the southwest coast and in Chumphon at the south-east coast demanded several injured people.
You go out of a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The Bombenattentats carry the same handwriting," said Army owner Danai Critmethavee Friday morning before journalists.
"We assume that it is a coordinated attack."
It would be too early to say about possible motives - but it is probably the acts of Muslim rebels.
Thailand's media also wanted to identify a pattern that is typical for the Bombenattentat Muslim Separators in the south of the country.
The Thai police, however, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamic rebellion movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotages that are limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the dominant military junta.
In recent days, the authorities would have received secret information on future attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed about the exact time and places.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police announced their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings as well as airports, railways, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always smaller bombs in Thailand, but they usually do not address tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used over years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
According to the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High safety risk (safety level 3) applies to the Provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary travels to these provinces are advised.
Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This also gives great influence to the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chew and Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos, while the country is moving towards stability, improvement of economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of blood disturbance, holds itself benefiting from having led the Kingdom to stability and order again.
However, the military has not managed the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed.
Nearly a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shout - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the most bloody attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "identitary movement" has been visited by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several national offices, the Constitutional Protectors in the Federal Federation have also monitored the group.
"We see in the 'identitarian movement' points for endeavours to combat the freedom of democratic rule," said Constitutional Guardian Hans-Georg Maaßen of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffamed in extremist ways.
That's why we're watching the movement.
The "identitary movement" is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "the loss of its own identity by overexternation".
Constitutional protector in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Sachsen and Thüringen - already observe the "identitarians".
Measures said that his authority voted closely with the national offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'identitary movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Constitutional Protection Manager.
In general, extremists try to talk to them in youth-right language, often with poppy music.
That did Islamists as well as legal extremists.
This is not a fantastic advertising for your own thing.
The propaganda is supposed to respond emotionally to people.
Young people are particularly offensive there.
That's dangerous.
Lastly, there had been reports from several federal countries on contacts of the "identitarians" to AfD politicians.
Measures said he has no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - is changed by certain extremists and becomes so extremist.
Therefore, it is essential that such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is unrecognized.
In view of the significant increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum candidates and refugee accommodation, Maßen said that he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But we have found in recent years that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the free-speaking group.
It may be that there are other legal terrorist groups or smallest groups that plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other legal extreme motives.
However, a German or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognized.
The previous groups have been developed at regional or social networks.
Anxiety pointed out that many attacks on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before.
That's the worse.
Many of the suspiciouss in attacks on asylum prevailing have not been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or adherents to the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes, which had previously had nothing to hate with legal extremists, which may have been politically different or have chosen CDU, SPD or left, which have radically radically radicalized themselves by the right-extremistic atmosphere."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet hit
The Olympics or World Records do not always determine the slogans in the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia was so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV images at time.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In social networks, Habte then became a viral Internet hit.
Actually, the 24-year-old ended with a remainder of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th place of 59 launchers.
But it was rather his not just sports figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special start right from the International Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming more known in subrepresented countries.
Since most athletes are running in Ethopia, Habte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Soon the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "the roll of the whale".
On the basis of a "wool stand" the English Boulevard leave "The Sun" made fun about him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he hit only one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters free style, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
The course of Eric Moussambani in the Olympic Games in 2000 in Sydney provided media attention.
The appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to enter over 100 meters of free style alone.
Moussambani was then fired.
The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition.

Trump does not see the threatening election defeat so tight
The Republican presidentship candidate Donald Trump speaks at a election event in Florida.
If the election to the President of the United States doesn't matter, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going to the vacation.
If Donald Trump lost the US presidential elections in November, it would be relatively careful for him: "At last it will either work, or I have a very, very beautiful, long vacation," said the candidate of the Republican in a telephone interview with the U.S. television CNBC.
If it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correction, that's all right, said Trump.
He called the US President Barack Obama and the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic state of Terror Military (IS).
Lastly, within his party, more and more opposition developed.
Post entails trade in electrical transporters
An electrical delivery vehicle of the German post in action.
The interest of other companies in the company is evident.
The post plans to sell their electric vehicle StreetScoooter as well.
Soon the group wants to start trade with the transporter.
The Post wants to offer its electrical transporters on the free car market from the next year.
"We want to get in the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
For months, the company has examined whether it is intended to sell its own developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, also to other establishments.
Post board Jürgen Gerdes had said that it was always demanding, for example by craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "The Mirror" the Bonner Group is about to enter the mass production of the vehicles soon.
In the post-own manufacturing, the company plans the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the group would want to increase his fleet of electric cars significantly and peil a complete change to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK conduct declines after disappointing business numbers
The Consumer Research Company GfK exchanges his boss Matthias Hartmann.
Although the withdrawals came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK announced that the chair of Head of Director Matthias Hartmann becomes even more uncertain, the longer the success he promised.
Turbulenzen at the top of Nürnberger Marktforschungsunternehmen GfK: After again disappointing business numbers and the withdrawal of company management, the global number Five of the industry is a new start.
The GfK Board of Directors wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the GfK Arno Mahlert is already dismissed from the Board of Supervisors on 12 September.
The leadership of the Board already took over on 1 September the former member of the Board of Directors, Gerhard Hausruckinger, informed the company.
He should officially take over the function of a "president" until a successor was found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to call a business speaker on Friday.
Those who will lead the market research company in the future are still unclear.
In investors, it was said on Friday that the shareholders were last greatly disappointed about the remaining successes of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK peak since 2011.
"The fruits of restructuring are not yet seen after 5 years," it said.
Given the last poor GfK business numbers, each shareholder is at some point disturbing.
"If this was the case with BMW, this would also make the Quandts like that," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss drive even in the second quarter of 2016 after return in the prequartals.
With 361.2 million euros, turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the previous year's comparable quarter.
As regards the first half of the year, sales decreased by EUR 721.2 million by 3.4 per cent.
The profit in the second quarter has, above all, burdened the company's lower value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The depreciation of the value of 139 million euros in the Consumer Experience business sector made a loss of EUR 148,2 million under the line.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had gained a group of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus run out in crumbing corners in graves: Eight hurts
In case of an accident of a bus with 43 elderly passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Crummhorn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police informed.
The 66-year-old driver of a travelling company from Eisenach had to eliminate a carriage that was partly travelling on the counterway.
The bus came right from the street and threw into a grave, as a spokesman of Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the situation of the bus, the people couldn't leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire Force released the inmates.
Six rescue cars and an emergency physician came to the accident site on the country road 2.
The uninjured travelers were brought back from a line bus to the Crummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the travelling company.
The detectives invited the carriage driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic meters of wastewater are 3.44 from 1 October 2016 for the wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl instead of 2.10 Euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 Euro (to date 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euro (to date 2.18 Euro).
In the installation in Azendorf, the waste water fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.
After a overflowing calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhauses (CSU) reported, when approving the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that there are coverages for these wastewater plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the installations in a cost-effective manner on the basis of legal grounds.
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as business and industrial enterprises from Welshkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take the money bag deeper.
The charge increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the Board, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater plants of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovers are also compensated from the previous calculation period.
The grave fee increases justified Schmidt so that all three wastewater plants deal with relatively small facilities with a very small wastewater attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenditure on the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave impact.
In addition, the dairy rise in all three plants is slightly declined.
Furthermore, during the downward calculation period, all three plants were not at the last affected by renewal and repair costs due to their age.
The installation in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the installations for Welchenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp nearly 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that in the wastewater plant Azendorf, the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to damage.
In the pump coal, the nearly 20-year-old funding plants had to be overloaded from the ground, and Lopp had to be extruded after nearly 20 years of operation of the first clear deck, disposed of the sludge and built up an additional ventilation option in order to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "For these exceptional expenses, the fortified care and maintenance costs, which should be taken into account accordingly during the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs which were significantly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhouses made it clear that in the small wastewater attack in the three installations, the costs for the operation and maintenance are "full".
In addition, Schmidt, the market community remained spared from high maintenance costs in the waste water plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for these installations is considered to remain precarious in the long term, since it is not possible to extend the disposal area of the sewage association Friesenbachtal to these plants because it is deficitary facilities.
Bulgaria booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (from June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, as positive 0.2% were booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to CPI -0.8%.
Consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, compared to the previous month, a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile, household appliances and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month in alcoholic drinks and tobacco; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identitys in such a way that already limits to the absurd.
You can turn into ananas, dog or figure that could be painted from a Roy Lightenstein.
The filters are unblomed, qualifying tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All defects come to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past criticized them in which they were accused of propulating the app blackface or white skin as a beautysideal.
When some users were suggesting a filter that was made up to them, false teeth and dim wings, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "Gelbsicht".
They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed out a greater problem that the company has a diversity.
The news and anxiety were widespread on Wednesday, with reports by The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered a excuse: The filter was thought as a hommage of anime-characters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced the Rassmus reminded the filter of hurtful clays.
Others decided to reject the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Savepani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet about the photos was widespread, wrote that the filter was "injuring and softly said unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the opposition of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-viewed, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural trailer.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are in different races than their older opponents - could rather assume to expect sensibility.
When one of Snapchat filters generates an image that is offensive for a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asked others to do the same.
In a record for media and in a telephone interview, she said that they believe that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices in Snapchat.
Zhu criticized mostly the white, only male leadership and ended its order with a hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Besides, she has no different representation of people with other skin colors in their employees, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say what is against it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that mostly has left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, it rejected Snapchat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently set up a staff officer focusing on under-represented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, on her hand, said that she was going to close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if she needs more users like us to say that this is not OK."
Military management counterfeit ISIS Secret Service Information, establishes the Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed information in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria if it had allowed the actual conditions on the site, an investigation committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of the Republican members of the Army Committee, the Secret Service Committee and the Wear Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service Analysis who reported how managers changed their assessments on American efforts to fight the Islamic State.
The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information, which was typically dismissed by high-level Centcom Commanders, regularly made a more positive picture of American efforts to combat terrorism than it would have allowed the actual local conditions and were more consistently positive than other news services," quoted a newspaper article.
"What happened to Centcom is inappropriate - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the Representative House, stated.
The management errors in the Centcom reach up to the top of the organisation.
The 10-page report shows in detail constant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts to train the Iraqi forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government peaks have been given under Obama instructions to change the reports, it shows how analyzers were exposed to the pressure of their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"By the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts are,” the report stated.
For example, a Centcom publicly announced that a military recovery of Mossul could start in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigations, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, republikan Congress Member of Kansas, in an opinion.
From the midst of 2014 to the midst of 2015, the tops of the Central Command changed the reporting reports to reduce the danger of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force into life after being played to them that analyzers worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed with more detailed knowledge while the investigations are continued.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are ongoing by the general inspector of the Defence Ministry.
Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own knowledge on Thursday, which was in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of anti-resident assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced in an opinion by the High Democrat in the Committee, a member of the Representative House Adam B. Ship.
This process, says Mr. Ship, "temporarily delayed the publication of reporting reports", damaged morality among analysts and "that excessively little room for different opinions."
But Mr. Ship and the Democrats claimed not to have found any hints of the White House's intervention with the Centcom Analysts regarding a "definite political opinion".
The preliminary results of the surveys of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon General Inspector, which were received after complaints by Centcom Analysts.
Dr. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Defence Ministry would not comment on the Congress reports while the investigations of the Inspector General are still ongoing.
But he also stated that "expertens sometimes have quite different opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Defence Ministry welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have reactions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by an increasing number of members of the Defence Ministry).
However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of deficiencies more than ten years ago when a Centcom Analyzer, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the government of then under George W. Bush, against the recommendations of many analysts, had only a small crew force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in rebellion against the current report on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government authorities, notes that against the government's statements, air hits against the raffinadery held by the Islamic State, there would not have been any significant impact on the financial situation of the Terror Group, since these provisional raffinadery had been operating to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, reported the Times in September.
Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative because of his excessively positive assessment of the battle at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Britain is before
One day after she had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3-0.
Five gates in two games should actually represent a remarkable performance, but Bam (27) said they couldn't remember that they've ever done.
"I have no idea." she said.
I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.
She knows that, however, the American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in the first place in their group with the British girls who remain unfounded after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-final, the game will decide which of the two within their group will get the first and second place from six teams each.
The first placed one will leave the strong Dutch women a little longer to the leadership of the other group.
Whatever the game may go out on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places in the past London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time when she was three years old, she had a hockey hit in hands (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), when she was 16 years old, she became a national player in the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympia in 2008, as she could not qualify for the frame.
Then the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year Craig Parnham, an English coach of the National Team, began to turn things to better.
"A cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workplace in London that we have now.
We have been able to scratch the rod around completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the Torreen in the first half of the game with a backhandback from the nearby area.
India had gone to the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tight and held the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game in her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and jumped the ball into the gate to provide a 2-0 lead to the American women.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of all tournament for the gatekeeper of the United States, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolin
Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and indispensable, a rage of battle between competition and pursuits.
It's like the Olympic Fackel itself is a burning stick that is given by the armburst protector to swimming to the tower to the triathlete.
You can't activate the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue at the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is with the Olympic Games for the first time and a woman's swarm with graves, could have been under these known names sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and welcoming TV advertising if he was a swimmer, tournament, or even feather.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Trampolin Towers.
The Olympic Flame does not illuminate any event equally.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports types that are not generally recognized: Air guns shooting, bow shooting, Badminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may rule it for a long time.
But if I are to argue modestly for my particular favorite, then let me focus on the discreet charm of the trampolin.
Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had his debut in Sydney, it has been noticed so splendid for the past 16 years that many who I had asked did not know that it was at all an Olympia sport.
This could also be regional ignorement.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampolin jumping and had an athlete that managed until the end of 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampolin jumping has a certain external charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
In this place, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just a earthly enthusiast.
It has a humoristic potential - the cartonous citters of his never wanting to end up - but also the grass of the tower and diving, the two sports types that unite it essentially.
The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "sprungbrett".
Splendid winners jump on a giant trampolin, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to have a series of falling movements (drawns, mounts and salts) before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympia programme after the execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Two-year-old athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will come across in Rio.
The most common Olympic Vector is straight.
Medal hopes must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground.
They are not only hunting the target line or the starting wall, but also a second hip target in the television transmission: the world or the Olympia record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admiring, even fanatic - and it's enough to even touch an audience to tears.
But it is also what I feel tired when I view these games.
Of this, the trampolin offers an atemphase.
The vectors of the trampoline jumper is upstairs.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she screws off, seemingly hard like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.
The women's qualifications and endorsements will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men's at Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will radiate the ends as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
Between the Olympia, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general.
If the consciousness increase can only be achieved through the gap and the objection of male athletes - as the male US tourners recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new catching to air.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. alliance
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants who demand political changes in Ethiopia were encountered by the government's violent resistance.
Witnesses say that during the collision with the police, ten protestants were killed in shooting exchanges.
Is Ethiopia just breaking together?
In the last ten years, it was one of the stablest countries in Africa, a solid West alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shocked the country and have eliminated more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the reply of the government was unmerciful.
Witnesses indicated that police were shooting and killing forty unarmed demonstrators.
Videos about the protests that are likely from the last or beginning of this year show how security people hit young people with stacks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The Head of the UN Human Rights Authority now demands an in-depth investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country together and in future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is to Nigeria the most populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy expanded in a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new pendler train in the capital of Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything other than an example of democracy - human rights organisations have constantly referred to the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, where dissidents were effectively brought to silence.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed, or driven into the destiny.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are many complaints that cover everything from the use of the ground to the cube grip with regard to the power of the governing coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the governing party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now controlling 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, the tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this tough, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics fear that separatists such as the Oromo liberation front or the national liberation front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less forced in recent years, could exploit and re-wapen turbulences.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of pre-cooking under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years, very many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more frequently and the Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they stay.
Several young Ethiopians claimed that they were gathered to protests like this.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnies in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the epochs, the Amharas, who are mostly from Ethopia’s Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics, while exploiting the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But it's just going to change.
"We are going to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, who represent about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the disturbance is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was 17 years of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia until he died of an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactic genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly delicate in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to treat opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was elected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analytics say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more blood pouring.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a rebellion in 2005 after millenniums protested against elections, which, according to analytics, seemed to have been stealed and stolen by the government.
During the following races, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of disturbance passed relatively quickly.
Developing experts praised Ethiopia's leader for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendler train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disadvantage of the Ethiopian Government.
And she assumes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked in Gondar, an amharic city, Tigray's business and the hatred against the Tigray becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analytics say the protests bring the United States and other Western allies into a strange position.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights across neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to break together in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin hike migration."
Donald Trump declared his claim Obama founded ISIS had been "Sarkasmus"
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to disrupt the last controversy that surrounded his campaign by indicating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, had not been seriously meant by the "funders" of the Islamic Terror Group.
This clarification raised new questions about the ability to communicate the Presidential Candidates of the Republicans, whether he could be able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his fellow fighters, who strive to take him in protection during an eventful phase, into the unreasonable position to explain statements that he couldn't have meant.
After making the revelation at a election event on Wednesday evening, Mr Trump returned to the claim on Thursday and in interviews stated that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the contrary to the previous day on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he meant the accusation completely serious.
When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr Trump weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama ISIS wants to destroy, the Republican presidency candidate wanted to know nothing about it.
The last storm of criticism is falling down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to focus his campaign because of falling survey values to the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talks about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr Trump tried to return to this subject again.
He warned about Twitter that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already presented Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he raised strong criticism when he thought that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course I meant the sarkastic."
This method allows Mr Trump to move the language limits into politics and then run back as necessary.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, as they arrive, and then, if appropriate, "clear" depending on how the reaction occurs." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also believe that he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of unclearing the tone for presidential elections, Mr Trump has adopted an even more edible tone as his survey values have continued to decrease.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with a great spring in the state of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally does not have to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humor.
But while he is more focused on the focus of the last months of his presidency campaign, Mr Trump's jokes have brought his loyal fellow fighters into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps' most prominent speakers, made great effort to defend the candidates today in a Thursday CNN interview.
"I think what he says is legitimate political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked about the correctness of Mr Trump's statements, whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS, it was a almost unknown, small organization, he called it backwards, perfectly wrong, and it happened because he pulled the troops from Iraq.
Most Mainstream republics try to argue that the government under Obama, where Mrs. Clinton served as Minister for Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread by abandoning aggressive control of the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and pretended them to ride around each of his words and to be against him.
He shocked the "arm, sad" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats spotted Mr. Trump's excuse as just another proof that he was inappropriate for the President's office.
Once expelled about the price from the market, Café in Greenpoint comes back
Verb Cafe was a narrow café in Williamsburg, in which one could only pay bar that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Store Front were expelled.
The shop Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
It was the last loss in a renewed city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York's change, it's also new invention.
A released verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar slight atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café, who is owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outside, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for Bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the food card there are sandwiches with Speck and cheese and there are garnations such as caps and cleaned tires.
There are natural rice shoes.
The café no longer serves beer, for that there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady current of old tribal customers.
"Many old customers were also expelled by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer recently on a Sunday.
Oliveira, 34 years old, lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was at the coffee and culture in the verb that liked me," she said.
Now she drinks again coffee, even if she ordered a Blending Chai Tea that is another new addition on this day instead of her usual Iced Coffees.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-year and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before the work and inevitably always ordered the same.
"I came fourth after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything-Bagle with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and include new ingredients in the menu.
Today Rosenthal still gets his ordinary order, but sometimes he switches his everything ball with spectator, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he wasn't wrath about the fact that the soap business took up the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-boiled coffee of the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to go into her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the food card into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to postpone them soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has further advantages.
A local juice room wants to fill and sell the cold-breaded coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a studio and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that the entry of the local and ordering a new coffee felt like a return.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressive food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascendance to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a fine taster, President Roosevelt had a faible for refined delicate foods of the Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Water Turtle Soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato purea and as a desert a plume pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" was about the Chinese cuisine in the United States, while bricksman tells in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a living house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your latest collaboration, "A decent meal", which will appear on Tuesday in the Harper publisher, illustrates the history of the American cuisine during the great depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, narrowless imbis in the Flatiron District, which has already been in business since the Börsencrash in 1929.
Teatman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, Truthahn with potato pure and vegetable mixture ate.
When the reporter ordered hackbrates, the couple found this suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Richhaltige Lebensmittels were very popular," said bricksman.
There were peanut broken, liver cheese and bone broken.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many earthnuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe's laughing.
"It must have been lying in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the great depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, a all-You-Can-Eat buffet.
Women's crews bought for male field workers and it was served freshly baked pastes for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways with which the country was ceasing to be no longer the sluriff country.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for the Americans," Coe announced why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as thrilled: secret foods such as bread and box rolls became basic nutrients, the box rolls as "wonderful kind of food reuse", said the bricksman, since cooking could hide inappropriate ingredients under a cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of the American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Frequent mixtures were tested because a caloria rich and nutrient satisfaction was prior to taste or even healthy cuisine.
During their search for the book, which also includes recipes, bricks prepared a court from this season, baked tows with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to lunch," says Coe.
"It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked tires do not fit each other.
It was typical for many of the household economic recipes.
Like never before or since, budgetists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - pushed the country’s eating habits suchly.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household policymakers" and to meet the challenge of transforming pamps like cream spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical beats.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungering citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-Mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he was eating like the millions of the man of the world to whom he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," said Coe.
He ate in a nearly golden dining room and had a smoking.
He was a wonderful reality stranger.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a householder with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortable preparations."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs.
The fortune is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said bricksman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
In writing the book, the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of the brilliant's mother - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of the waste of food," said Coe.
Tegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the wind pocket incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe brought out a desert that they had prepared at home: the plume seat, President Roosevelt at lunch.
"It is called Prune Whip," said bricksman and added that it was a common tricks to miss modest recipes a decent name.
There was no hits, only plumes, some meal, sugar, water and Zimt.
Everyone deliberately dived a lepel into the tight, brown slide.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a look three times.
Like a Can-Do budgeter, he said to his wife, "A few hacked whalenuts would help."
Killed at bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old died even at a fashion bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to the picture, has saved almost 60.000 people lives.
2900 volunteers put their own lives on the game to draw people from broken houses and to provide first help in the war area.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil protector, which shows him in a 11-hour salvation of a teenage from the trembling of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a bright symbolic figure in the gray of war.
As heroes, however, he never saw himself, said, "For me this is the true Jihad."
"If I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself attacked the victim, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters threw four fashion bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorogas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breathing.
"We now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb in order not to play children with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest whirlpool is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna Research Ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic until today.
Grönlandhaie only gets up with 150 years of age.
It is commonly swimming along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five meters long beast accelerates 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a robbe at this maximum speed.
This slow lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent approach for a high age.
Julius Nielsen, from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues, reports in the journal "Science" at least of a Greenlandhai that could be 392 years old.
"Wahnssinn", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.
Although the evolutional biologist has long suspected that greenland sharks are stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, at last they live mainly in the Eismer before the thin populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in the winter.
Accordingly, researchers know little about the lifestyle of the greenland shark.
Their time lupe rate measured when they provided six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
Protecting these sharks still: In the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a robbe, another had swallowed the bone of a young ice cream.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrols on the ground of the eismer and are looking for cadaver, who go down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now exploring 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen picked up before Greenland or Spitzbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the core of the shark with the carbon 14 method.
This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the shark, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon 14 in the lenses core.
Its birth should therefore be after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons attempts threw larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, the lenses core contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapon trials in the third smallest animal, so it was likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 during his investigation.
On the other hand, all larger greenland sharks had normal carbon 14 quantities in their lenses, which are produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed a age of 335 years for a 493 centimeters long greenland hai, while the record-hai with 502 centuries is expected to be 392 years old.
That Greenland-Hai females were known only when they were longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age of length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centuries was at the threshold of gender maturity and his age was determined by 156 years old, greenland sharks are apparently allowed to be at least one and a half centuries.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates at present.
The fact that such methusalme lives especially in ice waters is no accident.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old greenland whale, in whose speck was on the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon peak, was also caught before Alaska.
Through low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there is often on the sparrow flame.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In addition, to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume is growing much faster than its surface, through which the animal gives warmth.
The heat loss of a gram of the mouse is therefore much greater than in a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as soon as possible," explains the evolutional biologist scourge.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in double pack
At the recent meeting, the Municipal Council has discussed issues around the building.
With the facilitation, the Board took the notice of Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the recently identified residential areas can finally begin".
After the ground, parceling and locking questions were cleared and the requests for measurement were submitted, the sale of the land in the residential areas "Strßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Rike Binderstraße - Ausbau Abschnitt 1) is no longer possible to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rurally marked and quiet residential community are similar to young families and rusty elderly.
As it was said, construction volunteers can report immediately at the Council Hall, about the award of the parcels, the municipal council is expected to consult at its September session.
In order also to comply with requests for the establishment of other businesses, associated with the creation of jobs, the Municipal Council decided to amend the new land use plan in sub-sectors, which was created only in the spring of this year.
For example, in the area of undertimelarn, the commercial area already identified there is expanded by two parcels towards state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
Thus, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city am Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies transferred from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Brexit-Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether funding houses from London may continue to operate from financial transactions throughout the EU.
For the so-called EU passport they have yet been authorised in Britain.
It's just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced transfer of jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" is expected to have 10000 new jobs at the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the Eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority and the ESRB Risk Council.
In Paris, the organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The close to the note bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW Professor Voigtländer.
While Luxembourg is home to a large funding industry, it is more difficult to cut down as well as Dublin in the infrastructure.
Frankfurt would be much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
The city is also pointed with easy-to-use commercial occupational occupations.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
In addition, the rents for first-class commercial occupational occupations are 50 percent higher than the main.
In addition, Frankfurt offered a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of the Mercer company consultancy, the city is on place seven, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris at 37th place.
Although life quality is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors", the IW follows.
However, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite the Brexit-Votum, the economic researchers believe.
This is also the case with force conditions: According to the counts of the Landesbank Helaba at the end of 2015, around 144000 people in the banking industry, in Frankfurt, it was 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent struggle with Merck
A U.S. judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs that you have created from the hepatitis C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from a $200 million compensation payment for the injury of two patents from Merck, which was related to the blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misbehavior of Merck, including the Minides and other unethical actions.
When the complaint was raised on Thursday, U.S. judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to approve the costs arising during the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to draw along with Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with healing.
The case goes back to the year 2013 when Gilead and Merck complained and owned themselves on laboratory work, which was based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
Armies supported by the United States say that they have again acquired full control over Manbij from the Islamic State
Armies supported by the United States have recovered the full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them, said a speaker of the group on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) come through after the excursion of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city, currently the city.
They have liberated over 2,000 civilians who were held as hostages by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish informed the Manbij Military Council Reuter, who was bound to the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are just doing cleanup work," he said Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax statement for 2015 on Friday, which gave a income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% to the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million for pleasant purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton earned almost USD 5.3 million in speakers; the former Minister for Foreign Affairs gave a income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published together with his wife Anne Holton his tax statements over the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency," Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.
In a violent contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false explanations and withdrawals as regards his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is usual for US presidency candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not obliged by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You're on the train," Clinton's electoral assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, as regards the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Advisor, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before the tax checks are not completed.
Trump's critics, including the republikan presidency candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it acceptable that his refusal raises questions regarding assets, donations for well-established organisations, business gestures and various other links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which the High Range Republican Trump calls for its tax declaration to be published.
On Thursday, she also discussed the subject during a talk about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax statements," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that during the 1990s, Trump has paid no or very little taxes, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a topic in the electoral struggle.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionary and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska called for Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its seat here to take a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said he was also undergoing a tax assessment of the IRS and Trump was "angry" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax statements declined until 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined rate of approximately 40,5%.
The tax statement of the Clintons of 2015 showed that it only paid USD 100 of its income, different from the majority of all Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund from which the Clinton dividends and revenues of USD 109,000 taxed.

Condoms with chilipuder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into people's residential settlements - they throw condoms on them that are filled with chilipuders.
The method has proved effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea of this already years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the US Nature Protection by training volunteers in villages in the north of Tanzania, using a violent four-level method to protect their houses and harvests without injury to animals.
Previously, many spices have used to defend themselves.
Friday is the world elefant day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we developed the ... Toolkit, we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, whereas they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant," said the manager of Honeyguide Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a fake and the bubble in a horn.
If he is not scared, a so-called "Chili cloud" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom whose end is turned to the ignition.
When it is ignitioned, the condom places up with a knall and sprays fine dust on chilipuders.
A suck usually already out to chase the elephant.
A last possibility represents a warrant who shoots a golden rain fire in the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
The City Council decides unanimously: No Kioskneubau am St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, the St. Goarer's investment projects of commercial operators with a kiss-hand - however, the retail trade in the core city is considerable to be significantly expandable.
However, the request for a reconstruction of a selling sciosk at Rheinufer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine Balcony in the building now rejected unanimously.
"In principle we welcome new commercial operators, but at this location in exposed position at the Rheinufer does not fit this Kiosk," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU fraction.
Jewish director breaks Berliner Hotel because Israeli pre-selection was removed after "Arabian" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots defeated a media restoration after he told that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli preselection, as it would have "required" an Arab guest.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" released his trouble at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country electoral list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.
For an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, "chocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "conscious decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it provoked more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preselection be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli Ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the South German newspaper.
We were disappointed and disturbed by this event.
That's really shameful.
The fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a greater shame.
That does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw "the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a pretty great resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some admitted to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "abandoned the claimed requests of Arab guests".
"Shake you," said it in another contribution, where it was pointed out that the hotel located at the noble Kurfürstendam is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all the accusations and called the incident a "failing" and "apologize" at Lanzmann, reports The Mirror.
"There was never a direct instruction," the South German newspaper quoted a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country preselection has now been added.
Police uses tear gas and rubber shoes against protesting Brazilian students
Students joined the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shoes against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to dismiss the students, which led to the use of rubber shoes and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in demonstrations to express their disturbance over the plans.
According to the suggestions of the governor of the state of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, some less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300 000 students are being implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffitits spread against the preliminary President Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been withdrawn from the office by a Senate voting voting.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran grew by 70,9 percent in the annual comparison.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies' interest in businesses in the country grew strongly, the ambassador informed.
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran, while new companies are willing to provide access to the market.
Of course, the further development of trade is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 per cent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran grew with 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade rise was achieved by supplying machines, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan is based on a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued about 35,000 visa, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are broken last year, " he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something that the ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit of the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses searched for: Drinking market in forest browns
On Thursday evening, a robbery attack was carried out on the drinking market of Rewe XXL at the Gerberstraße forest breeze.
Under guarding a gun, three dark clothes people who had mumled their faces demanded the production of cash from the drunk market employee and then fled first to foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW-golf.
How much money has been spent, the police don't share.
The actors are supposed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 metres large, i.e. relatively small.
The drinking market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Rewe market and can be seen badly.
After the attack on Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, the actors must have been driven from the parking parking lot located against the parking lot with the silver-coloured car, possibly towards B 256 (sladder ring).
Those who have made observations related to the seizure at the time (at 7:45 p.m.) should report urgently to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer leisure
Eight beautiful and happy days the children and adolescents of the social educational group/social group work of the Nagold child protection council spent with their maintainers on their summer leisure in Nussdorf, near Mühleacker.
In the quietly located recreational home Hardtwaldle, the life-friend group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
The first was to go to boards with the visit of the streichelzoos.
Secondly, after Moulbronn, where there was a special child leadership in the world famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
In the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep-sea in Moulbronn, who invited to jump, swimming and plants.
Kulinarian children and maintainers were delighted with their self-prepared body foods such as the saurs Latzle, the seaborne Pfunnle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewellery pieces were made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman furniture game.
Other highlights of leisure were the fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "bound evening".
On the day of return, the sun laughed, and the children and youths returned happy.
Haigerhole: Pilgrims for the palace of mercy
The ministers from Eyachtal Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were taken together.
In order to overcome the time until the next Romwall trip of all ministers in expected two years, the Supreme Minister round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and implement a multi-day pilgrimage.
Several Wall Travel Targets were examined and finally decided for the Bishop City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage was offered with the pave of mercy at Friburger Münster.
16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerhole and Holy Rooms made themselves on the way.
In the evening before, priest Storost sent out the pilgrims at a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim cross and gave the pilgrims.
From Horb, it was driven by train to the start point of Villingen, where also a Münster Our Dear Wife stands and thus the Pilger Road was joined by the Münster.
In the morning and evening, each day’s tour was embraced by a short impulse with various prayers, songs, and scriptures.
But also on the road, the Minis made a lot of field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song of a separate pilgrim song.
For the nights each of the local priesthoods were available.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasteful and strong dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, Furtwangen went to Gütenbach.
The next day, the stage was reached to St. Peter, which was the most strangerous roadway, but at sulphur heat, first had to go down about 500 metres of height and then get back to climb.
The reward that was earned was a common grill at the bathwear in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrim day in St. Peter's imposing monastery, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
Visually facilitated and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburger Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the palaces of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
In the Münster evening fair, the Minis of Cooperator Markus Obert arrived at the Pilger destination were welcomed.
After God’s service, the Pilgers were able to visit the Sacrist and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon it went back to Horb by train.
Finally, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were marked.
Shotte Callum Skinner storms home when British Gold rings for bicycle sports
Schottlands Callum Skinner broke out last night in the man team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his countryman Sir Chris Hoy had owned. The young pound made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympia Gold medals.
They repeated the trick after they picked up only a modest sixth place at the London Railway World Championships in March, despite the resignation of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hind.
Hoys retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the shot that has now evolved.
Hindes, Kenny - who won Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympia record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand countries won in the first round.
And the British Trio won the dual with gold.
Hindes was shortly back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A strategic change made a large part of the transformation, while the hind went into a higher walk to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out from his position as BBC experts and fell up Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they rose to the podest.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a smooth comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We set up an Olympia record in the end and defeated the world champion.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012 on Kennys and Hoys page, Hindes admitted that he was deliberately falling on the train after a weak start.
He pulled this statement back later and there was no objection from England's rivalry.
In such an excellent victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags."
We've been together in the last three months as a team.
We got so bad away with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympic.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that expects us successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form Kennys it is in the field of possible that he repeats Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a exploitation of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the one from Hoy.
Kenny will then take part in the Sprint, which will begin today and go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be struck as a ridder."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the goal in 3:51,942.
The World Record, won Gold in London in 2012, was at 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competitor, where Wiggins will certainly be focused.
He had struggled with officers before the qualification yesterday when he called functionaries to measure his body size.
In the corresponding female competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relys on his strong track wheel team to dominate the mean period of Olympic Games and to get a lot of medals.
After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were declined.
Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical leader Shane Sutton in the middle of sexism and mobbing claims, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks quite like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of the melting of Portland due to abolition of the energy contract
The future of the aluminum melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake, since the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all delivery contracts as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria to grant no further subsidies for the operation of the installation at the beginning of this year.
A subsidy defined for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be threatened by closing.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the melting process consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry melting, which led to the closing of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closing.
This step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the investment, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price of the plant.
AGL, which delivers the large aluminum melting with his Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is assumed that three other owners will cancel their contracts.
The facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the installation will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity through melting," the company informed.
AGL continued to argue that the contracts were called "safety transactions" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so that they will end in 2017.
"AGL therefore assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17,” said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on the revenues on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong deadline markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already deprecated the value of the contracts in its annual account of $ 187 million in "awaiting a cancellation".
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts, "the ability of Alcoas... to operate the melting or to ensure electricity supply to the melting" does not affect.
The U.S. company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analytics warn against the possible closing of the portland melting in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
In reference to the statements of the Analytics at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumed approximately 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts each year.
If both investments disappeared from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [stream market].
And for us as a power producer, this wouldn't be good," he said.
More than just one Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the desired September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand messenger of Estee Lauder and run on the fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this covers brought me to cry," wrote Kendall.
The disclosure of the covers followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the kardashians like that?), written reality video that shows the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets the cover of her sister and ends with a classical turn: they all have planned a surprise party.
This represents the cleavable act nearly every birthday season of a child's mission (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honestness of a sign-trick rabbit on a shipping site at 8 p.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Cardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to have hit the Vogue cover (they and her husband Kanye West were watching it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for herself.
The September edition is for Vogue the most sold issue of the year.
With an extent that is more similar to a tape than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (as Fashionista was from the 832 pages of the forest 615 pages advertising).
The discovery of his cover star is so desirable that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine were still transmitted before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, clearly more "frequency, the models" than "models that are famous" were on the cover.
Oscar prizemaker and Dior brand messenger Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even at the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "throughbreak model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good society.
These familiarities are not related to famous people or to reality stars or youths of today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (also if all of them apply to Jenner).
You are really talented women who are characterized in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success does not like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always somewhat excited.
In June, the only Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her "the dirts of the moment."
These feelings bought up again when the message with the appearance of Jenners came out on the Vogue Cover.
But riding around the distress seems to pass by at the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of yourself on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure time she is watching in reality TV, probably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Community legal centres reject 160,000 people each year
More than 160 000 of the country's relief needs are rejected annually by the community legal centres, while the industry is focusing on the effects of further funding shortenings on overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three of five persons - most older people, immigrants, help-needed workers, victims of violence and those who have no means of unfair destruction and similar things - are already rejected in their application for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively exhausted, are prepared for further reductions.
From June of the next year, these legal centres will lose 30% of their federal funds.
The Director of the Public Rights Centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Right Centres showed that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only be worse without abolition of the Federal Government's decision.
"Queenslands community legal centres are chronicly underfined, which means that thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with invisible and oppressive debts, families that go through separation, workers who have been unjustified - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The Federal Government will shorten the funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of help-needed people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We urge the lawyer-general and federal justice minister, as well as the senators of Queensland George Brandis to eliminate these reductions immediately, so that people can receive the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise legal aid funds to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community legal centres and their customer communities and that the Government of Palaszczuk invests in this important work.
Donald Trump election campaign accused after employees claimed to drag a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused of alleged inactivity after you have been informed that in February, their campaign leader for North Carolina directed a gun to a employee while they were on their way in February in a Jeep.
The incident is described in a complaint submitted by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday in Charlotte's National Court, a former software programminger for the campaign in this state.
Bordini said to have waited for months that the matter would be internally regulated before he realized that "this would not happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drew a gun, put his right show finger on the departure, and hit the run in Vincent's Kniekehle," said Bordini in his charge.
After complaining with the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four other people had already experienced the same experience with Phillip, he declared in the prosecution.
"Waffes don't have to be fired to make damage," said Bordini.
The accusation comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a restoration when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - shot weapon owners and arms friends - should take action if his Rivalin Hillary Clinton should be elected and judge.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had shocked his words from the context and that he wouldn't strike for violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for infringement of care and of Philip for body injury and persistent mental injury.
Trumps Press Speaker Hope Hicks was not available for an opinion.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news broadcaster in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
On calls to his consultant, innovative consulting services, was not responded.
The Republican Presidency candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Obersts Gericht, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Exploration before Country-Wahlen: Lose SPD and CDU
During the coming elections in the Federal States Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the government partners SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys by the INSA opinion research institute for the "Image" journal (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition could hardly continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both countries, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and thereby have good chances to continue to set the Head of Government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommers, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only close to the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left came to 19 percent (previous 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time on the country day.
Despite the slight losses, the green ones will return 6 percent (precedented 8.7 percent) to the Schwerin Land Day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 percent each on the country day.
According to the Berlin parliamentary election, the SPD of the survey would only be at 23 percent (wal 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (formerly 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time in the parliamentary House by 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry, in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in time lupe: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The successors today dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as a iPhone 5.
It was thick and larger, so it was not well in the hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clever.
The built-in storage was at first eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution today.
A iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the business just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros lovers can buy the devices still on the Internet, but they come somehow from the stone time of the Internet Age.
But 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish cell phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as "Buro in the West Bag Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, also by fax the communicator was to reach.
Even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser, even painfully slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be expanded similarly as a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
Very proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, that's about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was EUR 392 in 2015.
In August 1996, no one could realize that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.
The mobile parts of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, were finally sold to Microsoft and deployed.
The market today dominates providers who all came much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere be online, this is for very many people everyday day.
In 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Sales were approximately 1.4 billion devices, Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million pieces.
The global turnover with the devices is around EUR 400 billion.
To this end, the well-running businesses of the numberless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone, a whole industry has emerged.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came until early 2007, then Apple-Chef announced Steve Jobs on Mac World the introduction of iPhones.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and a Internet communications machine, to use everything easily by touch screen.
The victory of Apple began, yet today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market, had the checks.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The story now has Apple and Asian providers such as Samsung.
The smartphone is a self-consciousness 20 years after its invention.
In the mean, every German is now looking at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone off too once," just said Janina Kugel, responsible for staff in the Siemens board.
Sustainability is now considered to be a curse and blessing at the same time.
England has to guide the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local municipalities and throughout London.
For me, this represented the greatest attraction of Heathrows, as was then in London in 2012, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the extension of Heathrows is too large.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world stage.
The twins were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals a infrastructure project.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of scientific growth and to leave a property of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from T5 - which was chosen as a result of five years as the world's best airport terminal, until the T2 was built in the middle of the two most frequent runways in the world.
Now they are willing to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to guide this Olympic Spirit and extend Heathrow, and ensure our future trade and create a fortune of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "cat and Mouse Game" about adblocking
For companies who earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to deal with ad-blocking are equal to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block adblocks on his desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding of its advertising advertising to detect ad blocks the detection of what part of the site advertising is difficult to detect.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to cope with the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her-fight between the ad-blocking Open Source Community and the surroundings have already been in progress since the invention of ad-blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company for social media has joined in the fight is a strong indicative of how worrying advertising blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a last year study by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use ad-blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users every day, accessing Facebook via their mobile final devices, mobile advertising comprises 84 percent of Facebook advertising.
The company has looked at advertising blockers on Desktop PCs, as mobile advertising blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a speaker informed.
Advertising on Desktop PCs represents a sufficiently large proportion of revenue so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update his "display preference tool" to have more control over the people's targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that adblocks would be new filters of concern because they would also block content on the page that is not advertising.
"For users this does not represent a positive experience, so we are planning to address the problem," an Facebook speaker informed in an email message.
Advertising blockers are a stubborn means, so we have focused on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in the hands of people.
Override woman on suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was overturned in the early morning on Thursday at a suspected suicide by several vehicles on a motorway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman put himself on the street in the dark "in a act of despair" and was hit by several cars, the police said in Waadt.
It is evident that at 49 years of age, a Swiss woman who had been rided over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She died on site.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, said the police who invites them and any witness of the incident to report.
An exploration procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneva.
However, it remains waiting for one of the drivers to be shown.
Was a collapse avoidable?
That's something the lawyer has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not taken to responsibility.
In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs on the motorway in the middle of the night, as stated in the newspaper.
Last year, a policeman was released from the negligible killing after she had rided over and killed a man who was on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the street, the court took place.
The court found that the police - who had responded to an emergency call - went in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was "a perfectly exceptional and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has further information on the event on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under point 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabitable
The Venus was probably inhabitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere could once have identified earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.
The model also highlighted the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid dilution.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus exposes its dayside of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a rainscreen to protect the surface from a large part of the sun's heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than the earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus, similar to evolution previously suspected by planetists.
Although she was probably inhabitable, Venus - over billions of years - was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans diluted and their water vapour was burned away from ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogens were eliminated, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained back -- the Venus that we know them today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus Climate Models in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy goes back as a trainer of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy returned on Thursday as a trainer and vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and introduced a low codecision law in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and definiteness," said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
I have been thinking about how to improve this team for a long and much time during the summer, to give him more depth, to need it and to bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly coordinated with the organisation.
He must also have a codecision right in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sacic, who had rented Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contribution for the team.
"Patrick informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the winner of Jack Adams Award during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the best trainer of the League.
He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was struck in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the postsaison in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers reconcile conversations, defer Streik
Working struggles concerning the remuneration of North Sea oil workers will be exposed, while all dispute parties put themselves at the table for a new round of discussions, said negotiating leader.
Stricts against the Oil Field Service Provider Wood Group have been carried out on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unit and RMT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few full-day meetings in the next weeks, the beginning of the next year will begin to reconsider the problems.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, is a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced the rates on its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure.
The company's shortening of rates follows a 10-percent decrease for Unhore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the room needed to get through the market decline.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to dismiss its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its mega-conclusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower ro-help trip, a economic situation which was strengthened by the decision of the British to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish parliamentary Member Dave Anderson met with worker leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that have occurred since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy that works for many and not just for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $ 1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Star Cape of the Plejades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the pledges.
The new data helps the astronomers to understand why stars in the starhood are rotating at different rates and in what connection the rotation periods with planet creation are.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star hops, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Star Cape of the Plejades is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star hop, which emerged about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning faster now.
At top rotation rates, these mature stars expose large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of every star by recognising the time between the appearance of a detectable star spot -- like sunlights.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars rotating slow piroutes than smaller.
"In the "Ballet" of the Plejades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the star hoops of the Plejades are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stable qualitys such as rotation rates.
"The star hoop of the Plejaden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stable rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot in front of us that we want to know more about how, When and Why stars slow their rotation rates and, as a matter of fact, hang their "dancing shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports detailed about their latest analysis of the Rotation Rates of Plejaden, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star goes off
The tears run faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will last bear the tricot of his New York Yankees against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-month all-star game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was elected as the most valuable player of the Liga, he won the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signature under a 10-year contract has been declared to him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will function as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and the Yankees from 2005 he created milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays only two other baseball players have similar values in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old is not expected to be included in the glory hall of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the place.
Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to have taken steroids prohibited from 2001 to 2003 at the "ESPN".
In August 2013, he was locked to 211 parties by the end of 2014 due to a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect of having received funds for years through an anti-agging clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the locker was reduced to 162 encounters.
"The Liga could even have done me a favor for the year 2014, because I have played through 20 years without break," said Rodriguez then sophisticated.
His birthdays also do not go noiseless.
While many baseball legends again received the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job does not include a goodbye tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," ate Yankees Coach Joe Girardi.
Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and was told the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, was sympathetic explanations of fans by the Yankee Erz rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the trailers sang at the 4:9 downlay against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Found: Due to a positive baptism sample, Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official baptism cases.
A caught athletine would have won almost a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official baptism cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimming girl Chen Xinyi, 3000 metres barbecue runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight recorder Adrian Zielinski, was positively tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the beginning of the critical light athletics competitions are in time.
The diureticum hydrochlorothiazide has been demonstrated in Chen last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had occupied the fourth place in the finale over 100 m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in 50 m free style.
Chen has requested the opening of the B test and a hearing to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The National Association takes the matter "very serious and demands Chen full cooperation in the investigations," quoted Xinhua from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and accept the judgment."
The first time in history is not the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for sanctioning the athletes with positive cases.
In the evening of Rio, the message about the positive sample went through at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went to the opensives.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this is "a incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," explained the light athletine.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is intended to be the blood clotting agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B test should have already been positive.
Bulgaria’s Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately reported criticism to the athletin.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are watched, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, almost all weight-shapers from the chronic doping loaded nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympiasiast in class up to 85 kg was tested positively as his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabolic steroid nandrolon.
Both contradict the intake, but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the light athletes, in particular the case of Danekowa is another severe struggle for the reputation of the whole sport.
The World Association IAAF had banned the start of the complete Russian team until one exception because of systematic dopings, including the Laufernation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming sports, the former crimes in China had also led to violent disputes between athletes.
Thus, the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pink purple."
"If I see the podium over 200 metres of free style, I want to surrender myself," Lacourt said in the French radio.
Sun was also at the centre of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping deceivers," said this.
Sun had been tested positively in 2014 at Chinese masterships for the trimetazine stimulant, but only a three-month lock had to sit down.
Data cuue: So perfide express hacker her ransom
Programmers of depressive malware attack currently targeted companies - and are successful.
According to a current survey by Malware Defense Specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies interviewed have been at least once in the last 12 months, partially multiple victims of an attack with depresser software.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already aimed at a Ransomware depression.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms required by the actors to resume the attacked systems and data.
The actors specialize their expressor software according to the observations of malwarebytes on attacks in business networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially depressed ransom is significantly higher than in private users.
"We are currently watching a terrible rapid development of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world".
In 2008 most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the offenders discovered depression software for themselves.
First, private users were the goal, but the change to business attacks took place in the past few months awfully quickly.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it is aimed at searching for recently modified files such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainablely.
Then the software presents the demands of the expressors.
To get the end cipher code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the crypto currency bitcoin.
However, where private users’ personal photo databases are at stake, the company is about sensitive customer data or project databases without stopping production.
As a result, the damage is higher if a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported losses of sales by Ransomware, 13 percent had to completely interrupt business activities, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, multiple hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of illicit acts.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies paying get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the actors in view of the restraint in operation.
The hackers, on the other hand, know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the depressors and come to the result: the actors are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to gain more money.
They explain their victims via chat as they can pay by bitcoin, set up or decrypt freely accessible support websites for example files.
And when private persons are redeemed after payments of few hundreds of euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless gains from the Ransomware depression, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, safety expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider sophos explains: "A individual person can write a Ransomware circa within a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their damage software in the form of a software buildbox to the actual expressors.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10.000.
"Included in delivery is a adaptor, so that smaller configurations, appearance and burning can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The depressors then search for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the forums underground, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"Of course, the criminals then commission spammer with the spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company-IT managers in the malwarebytes survey rely on being able to defend Ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the actors are already following new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful erection, the actors threaten with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the potential for damage is much higher, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the actors could also take completely new goals on the Internet of things.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the freezing of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the actors then block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V works rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in both the first row and the fund, it doesn't work at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and act pleasant, only the top of the cockpit will fall down.
Multilateral than comparable vehicles are the HR-V at the vacuum.
There is not only a baggage space of 453 l available for high and 1026 l for folded back loans, but there are the "magic seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seating surfaces of the back bank can be folded up like cinema seats and thus offer dust space, which is high from the ground to the deck 1.24 m.
The baggage space can be loaded well, but the charging height of 650 mm is a little higher than the comparable peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rotational ranges.
However, he is likely to do his work a little more quiet.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is happy.
There is another engineering: a 1.5-l benziner with 96 kW/130 PS.
A all-rad drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the control is likely to be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves no wishes open in the tested top variant "Executive".
The safety systems include the City Note Brake Assistant (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the Trailing Assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he considers many obstacles to ranking as "coming objects".
The remote lighting assistant works very reliable.
And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic mark detection and disturbs the speed if necessary.
The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI books are below the bracelet and are therefore to reach something immense.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
If you do not want to invest so much, the gasoline will receive the diesel from EUR 20000, from EUR 23000.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline does not: crash on a passenger bridge
A airline is not responsible for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because a liability is only possible in the case of hazards typical for air traffic, the Supreme Court of Düsseldorf (Act: 18 U 124/14) argued.
The prosecutor had broken a knee on the crash.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, as the Court of Justice said.
The airline had to pay the man no compensation.
Injury: When pays the organiser
Diseased holidayers will only get money back after their journey if the cause of the disease is doubtless found at the hotel.
But this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests proved to show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was sick of diarrhoea and vomiting on the second day of her Turkey leave.
She spent almost the entire vacation in the room.
Their disease led the vacations to a defective clothing facility that, as it were, had contaminated the seawater.
The family felt that the journey had been inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
The applicants did not succeed before the court.
Although the clothing facility was defective.
However, the organizer learned only shortly before the departure of the complainants.
He had to assume that the sea water was okay until then.
So he did not injure his information obligations, so the judgment.
Since no contaminations were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possibly by seizure - is one of the general risks of life.
Of 691 guests were only 38 sick.
De Maizière said that after the violence of refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would be concerned about further attacks.
The State must be conscious and determined to respond at the same time to terrorist dangers.
Surely, our country will not answer the violence of the actors with hatred and division.
This triumph we will not favor the terrorist.
However, if criminals need to leave the country faster, this increases security and also strengthens the public's consent to refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the Bundestagswahl 2017.
He also announced a further staff reinforcement of security forces, "in medium four-digit size for several years".
Sympathy for terrorism has to be penalized again.
Video monitoring aims to improve, the law of arms is so novelised that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is difficult.
The last much discussed obligation for doctors should be maintained according to the Maizières words.
However, he wants to look for solutions in the dialogue with the doctors, how the danger of citizens could be reduced, he said with a view to psychological disturbances.
In order to prevent radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatised people.
For the persecution of criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet) de Maizière, the use of hidden investigators is planned.
SPD-Chef Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security further."
It is important that the minister of the Interior has expressed its opinion clearly against actionism.
"That was an ear fee for the sharp makers in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel said the newspapers of the radio media group (freeday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and the abolition of double nationality.
A general prohibition of full closure is considered to be a problem of constitutional law.
You can't forbid everything you refuse, and I reject the Burka's wearing.
You can talk about rules such as road traffic or for witnesses before court.
Green-Chefin Simone Peter suggested to the Minister that he wants to simulate with ever new anti-terror packages activity and actionability.
Left-Parteichef Bernd Riexinger said: "Flot vocals and a sharpness of the right to stay brings no more security to people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway provider
It is regularly on the circumvention road - here a picture of November.
But this is to be changed: the legal excise is to be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are standing on the occupational road every evening in the vacuum when riding over the motorway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16th and 17th August) in the area between the Hammer Road and the departure of Weseler Straße extends the right-abbieger track by 700 meters.
Car drivers can then enter directly from the hammer road to the right.
The great advantage: the transport is split up early, which improves the total flow on the widespread section of the Federal Road 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU fraction in the district representation Münster-West.
The drivers are nervous, especially between 17 and 19 p.m.
On the working day, the back to the bridge reaches the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond.
Reason is the needle ear on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Weseler Straße.
From here, the traffic is only directed on the motorway bridge.
The second trace had to be rebuilt a quarter of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary durability to take up, especially, the heavy load transport.
The duration of this engpass and the associated work-day duration cannot be stated by the competent country holding.
However, years can be estimated: because the bridge has an official remnant duration until the year 2034.
For the extension of the legal excise rate, the country's operation has consciously chosen the weaker time in school vacations because of disabledness.
Traffic will be carried over on Tuesday and Wednesday by the construction site.
Intercultural trip: Culture offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the "The Invisible House".
Nima's association and the boy theatre are now planning a music project.
Nima's Association allows youths with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Classe International" of the Forest School of Children's House has visited an idea of the award-winning piece "The Invisible House" of the boy theatre Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by Nima's Association, 19 students between 11 and 15 were visiting the incentive in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set up the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background, has aimed to visit schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project.
Most young people in the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among other things from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic pictures and video animations it would have been possible for them to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the boy theater Münster.
Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Languageel, and the young theatre will work together in the next playtime in the context of a music theatre project.
From October to December, youths with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will be given the opportunity to visit professionally directed courses in the fields of song, dance, play and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre and theatral language mediation are in planning.
The "Intercultural Travel" project continues.
In view of the increase in refugee rates, the association expects many classes who want to participate.
Rain instead of star sniffs: Hope for Weather Improvement
The weather has made the star-snuppen-lookers in southwest Germany a strike through the bill in the night of Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suitable for watching the sky spectrum because of clouds and rain, said the Chairman of the Starwarte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night to Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see many star snippets in the sky.
The starships are Persians, which belong to the fastest star sniffs of 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their names because they seem to come from the star picture of Perseus, which goes up in the northeast.
Recreational night: Tips against sleep disorders
In the evening you wander around forever, in the night you're awake for hours, in the morning it's far before waking awake is no longer thinking of sleep.
That's all but relaxing.
You are always in good society with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not refreshing.
How are sleep problems or sleep disorders expressed?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be many causes for them, stresses Hans-Günter weed, member of the Governing Board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What you understand in general below, but the insomnia is an insomnia, i.e. a in- and through-sleep disturbance.
Just sleeping feels many people inadequate or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German Hospital Medicine Association with practice in Lower Saxony Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Back there, organic, psychological or behavioural factors can be seized, but also medicines.
Not rarely the sleep disorder is expression of another disease.
"Very early wake up is most often in the case of depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are contingent on each other.
For example, if you have a bandship incident, you may be bad, wake up every two to three hours and may begin to grieve everyday problems and care, weeping gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you get sleep disorders to the doctor?
If you are not well sleeping over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are affected on the day, you should go to your doctor, you should advise meat.
The disturbance can look quite different: one is depressed, tired, unasleeped, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is mildly irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical disorders such as stomach or headache.
To ease sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.
As treatment options, behavioural changes, cognitive behavior therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping tablets are only in exceptional cases and not more than for two weeks - in question.
Lower sleeping medicines are hardly available in Germany, stressed Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, you should first contact the home doctor in case of sleep problems, advise wheat.
He can investigate whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleeping work, and what's happening?
For an examination at the sleep lab, doctors advise, for example, in snakes with athemaus sets, in ill daily tiredness, in sleeping converters or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, fietze explains.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Don't do any lunch sleep," says Fietze.
After the cable you go to bed at his normal time.
Besides the electrodes on the body, wear a nose glass, a chest belt and a feeler on the finger.
In addition, a camera records the sleepers on the roof.
How can the affected manage the problems?
There are quite a lot of stainless screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weet counts: Regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed, not sleeping in the day, not television for sleeping, avoiding alcohol and not watching the clock at night - then you start calculating immediately, and that is not at all encouraging.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself to the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympis via Facebook.
In December 2014, he had collected gold for the first time at the short-speed world championships in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now, the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has been protecting his ex-team colleagues in criticism via Facebook.
"In a country in which an Olympician receives 20,000€ premium and a jungle king of 150,000€ no one should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on Friday on his Facebook page.
The support system in swimming sports is bad, but the baptism controls are very good.
This does not allow us to compete with countries that promote a lot and that we do not look at or even operate in the field of doping.
"I don't say that checks should be stopped here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
The same should be done with countries.
"If it is not possible to control a certain time before WM/OS by independent WADA/FINA controls, it is not allowed to participate," the Hamburger calls for the election who is currently operating an icediele.
Airport: Band of luggage thieves caught
Professional thief at Düsseldorf Airport
On Thursday, the German police's civil fences managed two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
As a band, the suspects had committed several bags and luggage thiefs.
By 21:30 a.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band known to the police from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several defects since mid-July this year and had taken part in the Community, work shared and particularly professional.
The specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can prove four deeds to the thieves who had been specially committed to criminal offences to Germany.
They had spent more than EUR 15,000 in total.
Old buildings, some Lindenbaums, intermediately a rest of headstone plasters: The Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work that way on the first view, but the police count it among the "hazardous places" of the city.
If you go along the road from East to West, you'll pass to playgrounds, a freshly stretched children's garden and a bioshop.
On the façade of a grey house, someone sprayed "shy!".
Against a Lidl, which is to be cut off soon, is already built: until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here.
However, articles about this "third city part", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are preferable in recent weeks with burning cars.
Reason is the house with number 94: Once it was occupied, now the inhabitants have rent contracts, but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Especially the Berlin Innensenator Henkel has spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a hard action by the police against the project, called the area "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 starting point of autonomous violence.
After the spaces on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police officially said that for three weeks, with 30 to 40 officials and three local crew cars, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from joining the house with number 94.
In the meantime, building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners.
On 13 July, a Berlin administrative court decided that the space had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers departed under the joy of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the citizen seat in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain for late.
A primary school and children's gardens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, is particularly generated by police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share concerns for increasing rentals and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a kiez who wished to have a majority of police protection against vandaling links.
The grave that the Berlin interior and the police open between house owners and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional worker district, which has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Also house occupations and the housing projects born therein have been a long part of Kiez: 1990 many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer road all near the Rigaer.
While the Mainzers had been cleared under great police order in a regular road battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly magnetic for tourists and electorates from all over the world: with them, people from DDR times and former owners share their kites.
This is also noticeable in the rentals, which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 in new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized on threaded discs or freshly deleted facades, which have been pursued with color bags.
No other road was so often mentioned this year together with the words "left-autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors view this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury are based on statistics almost exclusively on police.
Most of the crimes are damaged, which tends to meet the new buildings and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no reason for uncertainty.
With regard to violence, she is absurd: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who have certainly not been.
Also the famous burning cars have no longer been given directly in the Rigaer.
For the studied architectine, her road is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "Here you help one another, live together on the street and get more from one another than elsewhere."
New builders are consciously moved to the Riga's street - and remained.
Therefore, it was so important for her that the residents to get their road back: from the police, politics and the media, all of them suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July.
But in the eyes of inhabitants such as new buildings, the road will continue to be taken away from them: through facially unvisible new buildings in former building holes, which disappear the old inhabitants.
"These are, at last, property apartments that are not interesting for many here - rather people living here who are not so well occupied," she says.
"Custom and destruction I can't definitely accept."
But what should you do if you never listen to anyone?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the inhabitants.
For those who are angry with color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scenes belonged to the Kiez.
Anyone who moves to it should be aware of this - just as someone who moves into a knee district can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deusschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in matters of integration and organizer.
In addition, she is a social worker on site.
Since July, Annika Deushle is the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogy supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, the occupation of refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else are mixing with them.
Regine Customer from the Working Circle indicates that the honorable officials are more than grateful that Deushle is now there, the egg-leating wool milksau, which has a problem.
Thus, some - less ridiculous than rather the number of tasks that were desirable - would mean, as the administration wanted to describe the office.
An administrative expert has been sought with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in social work, just a egg-learning wool milksau.
However, administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.
In particular, organisation, work with the people on the site and also behind the scenes and networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50-percent set on a three-year basis.
"It was high time," says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschele supports honorable and principal players.
There are major and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers are in the Wasenstraße
A serious problem has been to find apartments for the disappearance refugees that have been recognized since some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection.
They must place the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.
The costs of building, renting or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility is changed from the country council to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every tenant wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work so far, it's dependent on private apartments, so Deuschle.
Consequently, local housing needs to be cultivated, as it is so beautiful.
So new containers will soon be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine customers and Annika Deushle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are practice sites, training centres, schoolplaces, single-Euro jobs and help activities for refugees and migrants to be found or established.
"More places would be good," says Regine customer.
Many people work at the farm or help housemasters, do non-profit work - and that is motivated and very well, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.
That's "no employment therapy".
Activity does not mean just work.
The day needs a solid structure, says Deuchle and Customer.
People would have to develop a feeling of belonging to them.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here also administration and honor officials are jumping in.
It is central that refugees feel that they are desired and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can overcome the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Whoever sometime develops the feeling that he can help no one in Urbach, may not work and be unnecessary, he will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
However, there are also problems, says the customer honestly, " people who are nothing to do." Therefore, the work of Deushle and Customer is always to motivate others.
That's all a "mammut task".
A difficult question: Are they afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach, after the recent events?
"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some naives may call." A residual risk could and would not want to exclude them.
But the helpers are sensitized.
These events are also the subject of refugees.
They'd be afraid that the attackers would put them in charge.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Thus, head and honor officials on the site and in the region must look forward to activities.
They always have the background that soon a new shot of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, politics are shocking.
Actually, it is unfair to put them on site helpers.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach yet," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine customers also make it clear that the Urbachers are already exhausted by integrating the people of the past reasonablely.
These are about 100 people at the moment, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, you need to help them, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Inbreakers with helicopters
The police helicopter fled for about an hour from different areas - without success.
Two unknown men are violent in a flat in a multi-family house on the Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8.50 p.m.
The inhabitant surprised the two and struck the unhold in the escape.
The two men were about 1,65 to 1,70 metres tall, well masked, both blue jeans and black capus pullis.
They fled towards the Innenstadt.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter.
The flag survived without success.
Possibly the unknowns fell near the apartment or when they escaped.
Baden-Württemberg: Police determined after Rocker attack on Imbiss
After an attack on an Ulmer Imbiss, the police determine six suspects from the rocker environment because of severe land peace breakdown.
In the case of home examinations, evidence and drug precautions have been ensured, the police informed on Friday.
About 20 masked men of a rock-like grouping had, according to the police in July, thrown bottles and stones against the show window disc of an imbisse.
After that, they're supposed to have attacked two guests and hurt one slightly.
Then they fled.
At the imbiss and at the adjacent building there was a damage of EUR 10000.
According to the researchers, there is a dispute in the Ulmer Rockermilieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
