Welsh Members do not want to appear as ‘muppeter’
Members of the Walisian National Assembly Assembly Members, who are today known under the Abbreviation AM (Assembly Members), are not fully satisfied with the proposal that their title may be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is based on the plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Wallis Parliament.
Representatives of the whole political spectrum fear that this can lead to ridicule.
A representative of the Labour Workers Party explained his group was concerned because ‘the rim on Twp and Pwp.’
For readers outside Wales: In Walisian, twp means ‘dustete’ and pwp means ‘besh’.
A representative of the Wallis Party Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was “dissatisfied” and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Walisian part of the Conservative Party said that his group was ‘open’ for the change of name, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word ‘Muppet’, which, in addition to the name of some known docks, is also a British snake word for ‘dust’.
In this context, the Walisian letter W is pronounced in a similar manner as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like a 'uh' sound.
Assembly Commission, which currently develops laws to introduce the change of name, said: ‘Of course, the members themselves have the last right to decide on which name they should be referred to.’
Government of Wales Act 2017 granted the Wallis National Assembly authorisation to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation showing general support for the renewal of the national meeting to the Wallis Parliament.
With regard to the title of the representatives, the Commission supported WMPs (Welsh Parlaiment Members), but the MWP option was most supported during the public consultation.
The representatives may propose any other alternatives, but to make all parties reach agreement may lead to a breach of headline for President Elin Jones, who, according to the plan, shall provide a draft legislative amendment for the names in the next few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the functioning of the national assembly, including rules for discrimination of representatives and the design of the committee system.
Representatives have the last voting rights on what they should be called when debating the law.
Macedonians are going to the electoral waters to determine whether the country’s name is to be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote on whether the name of their country is to be changed to ‘the Republic of North Macedonia’.
The referendum is held in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with the neighbouring country Greece, which also has a region named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a requirement in its territory and has at several occasions opposed its applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a opponent of the referendum for the change of name, has said that he will ignore the vote.
The people's supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of name is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's styles – the crowns in Harlem struggle
"The old ones I spoke to have told me that before in time there was a bar and a church on every corner," says Adams.
‘Now there is none of the parts.’
He said the bars were understandable.
‘Persons are socially interrupted in other ways’ now on the day, he says.
‘Bars are no longer the meeting sites of the local environment, which all regularly visit.’
As far as the churches are concerned, he fears that the money from selling assets will not last as long as the leaders believe. "And sooner or later they are back at the starting point."
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment building full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining places.
"The majority of those who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he says, "and therefore will only accelerate the day when these churches have to close the doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both crickets were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropole – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's one decade later.
The original white methodist group moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had held to nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's received a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boikott of dealers at 125th Street – one of Harlem's main hands – because they refused to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 made great damage to the building, and when Father Johnson's family children had plans for the reconstruction they bought a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly declared that the carillon was "the church bells of the poor people".
The expert playing the carillon in July called it something else: ‘a cultural tax’ and ‘a non-replaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world that was played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the largest carillonet at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's never replaced him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complicated interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of which have been initiated by the physics management of the church and others of the Bishop.
The Church Council — the leadership of the congregation, composed of legs — wrote to the Bishops in July concerning its concern that the Bishops were to ‘try to force the costs’ at the Church Council, despite the fact that the Church Council had not been involved in the introduction of the architects or entrepreneurs sent by the Bishops.
Some family children complained about the lack of openness from the Bishop's side.
Hai damages 13-year-old lobster thickness in California
A shark attacked and damaged a 13-year-old boy when he appeared after lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to the authorities.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had diving with friends in about a half-hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help, and that he and a group of others were swimming over to pull the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel he first thought that the boy cried out of excitement to have caught a hummer, but he realized as soon as the boy cried out 'I was bite!
I was bite!"
His entire bone was scraped up," says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
"I cried that everyone had to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was transported with air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is presented in a critical state.
The type of shark carried out the attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it wasn't a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim suffered serious damage in the upper torso.
The authorities closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to make its intake on the UK's beauty care market
Sainsbury's challenges Boots, Superdrugs and Debenham's with shop-like shrimp and beauty shelters, crewd by specially trained staff.
The extended shelfs are tested in 11 shops around the country as part of a strong entrance in the UK’s 2,8 million beauty care market, which continues to experience growth while the sales figures for clothing and home articles fall. If the attempt proves to be successful, the concept will be expanded to several shops next year.
The investment in beauty care is a result of the supermarket attempt to find a new use of the space previously used for TVs, microwaves and home articles.
Sainsbury's has said that they have to double the number of beauty care products they offer for 3000 products, including marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which the shop chain has never sold before.
Existing product selection from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also get better place in labeled areas, in the same way as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relaunches its Boutique smoking mark with mainly vegan products, because there is increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the parfum dealer The Fragrance Shop will test the sales table in two Sainsbury shops. One opened in Croydon in South London last week, while the other is opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network trade and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local retail shops means that the supermarkets must do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, Managing Director of Sainsbury's, said that the sales are going to be more and more like a cargo, taking up the supermarket fight against the cheap shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods out of food.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos sales in hundreds of shops, and has also introduced a series of Habitat sales after buying both chains two years ago. According to them, this has increased food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to upgrade the departments for beauty care and pharmaceutical products failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots early in the 2000s, but the collaboration was dismantled after a dispute about the distribution of the income from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 shop capotekers to Celesio, owner of the pharmaceutical chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan by adding a selection of luxury service brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's Trade Director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty shelfs to create more inviting surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who are so prepared to provide advice and help.
Our brands are designed to cover all needs, and the inviters and practical locations make us now a beauty care competitor representing a new trade experience.»
Peter Jones is “rassing” after Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement worth GBP 11 million
The Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones is sure to be angry after the TV host Holly Willoughby pulled off a 11 million's agreement with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home and accessory mark, Truly.
Their company was previously compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's mark, Goop.
Willoughby (37) who is program manager of this morning announced at Instagram that she left the company.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones angry by deducting from their profitable life-style brand for the past second to focus on its own new gold-shaped contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was “rassing” at a splendid meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was here the golden service of the television admitted that her new agreements – worth up to GBP 1.5 million – mean that she no longer has time for their clothes and accessory brands, Truly.
The company has been compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, Goop, and it was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced at Instagram that she was going to leave Truly, Jones left the United Kingdom on the way to one of her holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was undoubtedly the first priority of Holly.
It was a long-term investment that would give her economic security in the next decades.
Everyone's totally shocked that she's chosen to draw herself.
There was no one who could believe it when it happened last Tuesday -- it was just before the launch.
Now a store house of goods at Marlow’s headquarters is now ready for sale.»
Experts believe that this Morning programme manager, among the most popular stars of the United Kingdom, may cost the company more than millions of pounds due to large investment in products such as puts and lights, moths and coscows, as well as a potential delay in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother-in-law Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became Chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones has 40% ownership in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby shall become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV programme I'm A Celebrity.
A source that stands Jones near said yesterday "We won't comment on his business affairs".
Cheque case facts “and so in love”
He whispered about the criticism he wanted to receive from the news media for having made a comment some would view as "small presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
said Trump in her imitation of a news anchor.
‘I have not given away anything.’
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, after himself declaring that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a great shit on the road to nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the Summit in Singapore in June, North Korea’s High Diploma Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a ‘similar response’ from the United States on its early disarmament measures.
He noted that instead, the United States still has penalties aimed at keeping the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when he spoke for a assembly of his choosers.
"We're doing very good with North Korea," he said.
"We were going to war against North Korea.
Many millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a very good relationship."
He said that his work to improve the relationship with Kim has given positive results, such as setting a stop for rockets, helping to get released ferries and to get the lives after American officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10 000 people outside trying to get into this stacky arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump and pointed in the area right in front of them.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia are raising an island and killing hundreds of people
In the cooling water of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-profit organisations were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 % of Lombox's inhabitants had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international assistance to be transmitted.
“In many cases they have unfortunately made it clear that they do not request international assistance, so that is quite challenging”, explained Sumbung.
Saved children now set up a team to travel to Palu but are not yet sure whether foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the National Crisis Management Institute, said that Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palu to see if international organisations are allowed to contribute to the assistance.
Given the constantly exposed earthquakes of Indonesia, the country is terriblely badly prepared to deal with nature’s anger.
Lieutenant to protect from tsunamia is built in Aceh, but they are not a common view along other coastal lines.
The apparent lack of the Palu warning circles, although a warning had been sent out, has probably contributed to the death figures.
Even in the best circumstances, it is a challenge to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more challenging.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrading of Indonesia's falling-finished infrastructure to a major part of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and rail.
But the lack of money has been a major problem for Joko's administration, which is going to be re-elective next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sekteristic tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have changed to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christians and Muslim gangs struck in the streets with makeets, arrows and arcs and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge with late balancing in battle with Chelse
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League loss against Chelsea on Saturday by tracking 89 minutes in the battle at Stanford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passing from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from the Chelsea target while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to the left feet before he sent it to the longest corner.
The test went high over the box as the ball fell to the upper right corner of the network.
The ball finally passed over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the network.
"I just tried to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as it can do, so I just tried to give myself as good as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the edge come and touched the ball once and didn't think too much about it and just kicked it on."
Chelsea led with 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a measure in 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a pasture with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed direction near the middle course and sprinted into Liverpool's track half.
Kovacic came with a quick survival on the middle course.
He then fired by a great breakthrough passing that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the network in the longest corner with a left-footed kick past Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays against Napoli in the group game of the Champions League at 15.00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in the European League in football for men in London at 15 a.m. on Thursday.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memory mark that has been drawn into the dispute on ‘Rewriting history’
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatic puriteans.
But the Comwell Society history team has described Jeremy Crick's publisher as "supervisible" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, says: "It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace also became a goal.
The icon oclamm of the English civil war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe error Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing production of Cromwell is a proof of the 18th century's opinions and is part of historiography for a man many still think deserves to be shouted.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell becomes of many, perhaps more late in the 18th century than today, viewed as Parliament's defence against pressure from outside – in his time, of course, it was about the monarchy.
If this is a completely accurate representation, it is still subject to historical debate.
What is sure is that the conflict in the middle of the 16th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognisable figure that represents one side of that conflict.
His performance as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering.’
Killing pig kills Chinese pawn
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on its market in Southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, only mentioned with the surname "Yuan", was found dead and covered by blood from a cracked pulse year near a binge on the market in Liupanshui, the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is ready to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Xining, Qinghai Province of China.
He probably traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The morning after the cousin found him dead, and discovered that the gate of a nearby swine path was open.
He said that inside the pig's ten there was a big wrong blood on his mouth.
A judicial investigation confirmed according to the report that the 250 kg pig had killed the man.
"The bones of my cousin were bloody and maltracted" explained the cousin, named Wu, in a quotation to Guiyang Evening News.
Recording from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to eat their pigs.
His like was found about an hour later.
The animal who killed Yuan did not belong to him or his cousin.
While the police collected evidence from the site, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked inside to prevent it from attacking someone else.
Yuan's family and market management are dealing with no compensation for death.
Although it happens to the shield, it's not the first time it's recorded that a pig has attacked people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a Walisian farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg pig until the farmer’s wife managed to hunt the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to usual, but that the taste of blood may have a triggering effect.
"They're just playing.
They like tiny bits, and are very curious ... they don't try to hurt anyone.
You only need to show sufficient respect.’
The rest of the orchestra Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the south-west US
As reported, the orchestra Rosa is weakened by moving over the cooler sea on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rain on its journey through North Mexico and South-West-USA in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was an orchestra of category 1 at 05:00 ET on Sunday, and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a tree begins to be shaped across the Pacific and move eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will start pushing tropical humidity northwards to the south-west US.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the interaction between tropical humidity and the trawl approaching will lead to widespread southwest rain in the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm rain will lead to dangerous floods, fluid rubbish and fast and possible soils in the desert.
Dyptropic humidity will lead to downturn rates of up to 5 to 7 cm per hour in some areas, in particular areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5 to 10 cm rain is expected in parts of the southwest country, especially over large parts of Arizona.
There are opportunities for floods with rapidly deteriorated conditions due to the spread tropical rain.
It's very unwise to move around in the desert to the foot as long as there's a threat to tropical rainfall.
Strong rain can lead to river valleys to widely showering rivers, and thunder will lead to local winds that may contain dust and sand.
The tray approaching will cause local strong rain showers for parts of the coast along South Californien.
The total rainfall above 1,3 cm is possible, which may lead to liquid rush and fast, and smooth roadways.
This will be the first rainfall of the region.
Some spread tropical rain showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavily rain will spread to the corners states on Tuesday and continue all Wednesday.
October can lead to some intense temperature fluctuations throughout the U.S. as the Arctic becomes colder but the tropes remain very warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes over shorter distances.
We'll see a clear example of strong temperature differences throughout the Central U.S. on Sunday.
There will be almost 11 degrees temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of central and east-USA will probably get a warm start on October, with degrees high in the twentieth century from Southern Plains to parts of the northeast-USA.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday – this will be approximately 5.5 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate notification indicates that East Americans will most likely have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six TV networks, then Thursday's arresting witness of the Supreme Candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual violation that was supposed to have occurred in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political party continued, and broadcasters interrupted their usual missions to advertise Friday's great surprise in the last second, when it appeared that the senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged it so that the FBI should carry out a weekly investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate's court committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh felt her and tried to take her clothes off at a school festival.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he's 100 percent sure this didn't happen.
The shipment on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculates the average seer rate for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Seeing numbers were not immediately available to other networks showing the consultation, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, the Nielsen usually has problems measuring office viewers.
To give a little perspective, this number of viewers corresponds to the end game in American football mastership or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose opinions hosts have supported Kavanaugh's designation with a great enthusiasm, led in among the networks, with an average number of 5.69 million for the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest was still great after the consultation.
Flake was the main person for Friday's drama.
The moderate Office of the Republican delivered an opinion that he was voting in Kavanaugh's favor. On Friday morning, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras trying to take the lift to a meeting in the court committee while demonstrators shouted and cried to him.
He stood with a lower glance for several minutes while he was scolded out, while the event was sent directly on CNN.
"I stand right here before you," said a woman.
"Do you think he tells our country the truth?"
He was told that "you have power when so many women are powerless".
Flake pointed out that his office has made an opinion, and said when the lift doors closed that he would have more to say about the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the consultations several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should be forwarded to the entire Senate for Reconciliation.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI examined the charges against the candidate within the next week, which the democratic minority has called on.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
Flake took his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's choices had a great impact, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses the critics of "political game" around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, the British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused the opponents of her plan to leave the EU for "political games" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine the interests of the nation.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, printed side by side with her own on the front of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued her attack on her so-called "Chequers" plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal for the United Kingdom and the EU to obtain each other's tariffs was "very ridiculous".
Wayde Sims Shooting: The police attack Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected to have caused the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and intended for deliberate killing, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have released a video recording of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the basket roof.
The police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS partner WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted to have shot and killed Wayde.
His caution is set to USD 350 000, according to The Advocate.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death is indicated as a shot wound in his head and through the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for his working group for the collection of refugees, the state police laboratory, the Southern University police and the local population for the contribution to the investigation that led to an invasion.
LSU's athlete Joe Alleva thanks to the police force of the area for their ‘hard work and hunting for justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 m high forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 returnes per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball trainer Will Wade said that the team is "crushed" and "in shock" after Waydes' death.
"This is what we fear at all times," said Wade.
Vulcan sprays ash over Mexico by
The ash that sprays out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern neighbouring laws of Mexico's capital.
Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico's public crisp prevention etat, warned the population of Mexico on Saturday that they had to stay away from the volcano after the activity increased in the crater and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in one day.
The etat monitored several cases of bubble and shaking.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering windscreens on cars in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysics have discovered increased activity from the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital after a earthquake of 7,1 shaken central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police in conjunction with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independent vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after Protestants for independence had a conjunction with the police, while several thousand participated in competing demon stations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonian Polarizing Voting on Release.
A group of masked separatists was held back by the rebellion police, bombarding them with eggs and powder painting, which caused dark dust clouds in streets that are usually full of tourists.
Handcuffs also broke out later on the day, when the police used batons to limit the fights.
For several hours, independence demonstrators were standing and called ‘Never forget, never forgive’, face to face with Unionist demonstrators who called ‘Long life Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for less damage they received during the protests, according to the local press.
The tension remains high in the release-oriented region one year after the referendum of 1 October, which was regarded as illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separateist Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming violation of release, but it was bad because the vote was boicated by most who were opposed to the release.
According to Catalonian authorities, almost 1000 persons were injured in violent confrontations last year after the police tried to stop the vote carried out at election stations throughout the region.
Release groups attacked camps in the streets of the night to Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration was retained, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who participated in the separatist prost with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalony's possibility of being independent.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying with joy over getting a voice, but now we sit firm," he said.
Despite having achieved a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalonian independence have had problems with keeping the pressure up this year, as many of their familiar leaders have traveled in self-resident exile or are in conservation while waiting for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict is raised by politicians on both sides.
‘The situation becomes increasingly appealing’, he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been imprisoned in the waiting of a case since late last year, announced that he was going to be elected in the European Parliament next year.
"To be elected as a candidate for the European election is the best thing I can do to condemn the oppression and regression of democratic values that we have seen from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house wall
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 years of age are arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19.30 BST.

A brake may also have been fired against the car at a time.
Mengas attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 victories against Rangers
Dolly Mengas first target for Livingston secured winning
Livinston surprised Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerrard's second loss after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
A good hit from Dolly Menga proved to be crucial, and Gary Holt's side is now similar to Hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's side has still not won on the way away in the Premier League this season and will play against the leaders of Hearts, which are eight points in front of them, the next Sunday.
Before this, Rangers will play home struggle against Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained unleashed through six matches in the division. Chief Holt has not yet lost a battle after he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against his lonely guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, as their direct procedure caused countless problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but blowed on the target, and Alan Lithgow could only send the kick forward after shooting in to meet Craig Halkett heads beyond the target.
The host allowed Rangers to play in front of them, well aware that they could make problems for their guests at deathball.
And that's how the decisive goal came to be.
Rangers gave off a frishespark and Livingston found an opening – Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a clear path, and he scored a measure from the middle of the box.
Before this stage, Rangers had the ball almost all the time, but the defense of the home team had proved to be imperfect and targeted Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos achieved a almost score that could be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of the Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgrow sent a Livingston dead ball in a wide card pass.
Cruises remained in the Livingston box and were still saved, while two criminal requirements – once after Halkett's protest against the dividend Glenn Middleton – were overlooked.
«Fenomenal» from Livingston — Analysis
BBC Scotland Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phänomenal performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were fantastic all of them, and continue to overcome all the expectations of the way upwards.
The game style and the crew have hardly changed since they got on top again, but Holt will have a lot of the honor for the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was amazing and coordinated a hugely well-organized defence, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the tooth of the battle.
On the other hand, Rangers did not have my inspiration to divorce with.
Although they have sometimes been very good under Gerrard, they couldn't live up to this standard.
The last part of the battle was labs – they came only into the home half once – and there was a little of a arrival for Rangers, which is located in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiling and blue sky on Saturday 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate lunch together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between the NATO allies.
There has been a distortion of matters such as human rights, freedom of press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police declared security as the reason why a crowd of 25,000 was not allowed to gather before the mosque, but many trailers met nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan – many of them Kurdiers – also heard from themselves and criticized both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to let him enter the country.
The contradictory demonstrations reflect the division that follows a man who is shouted as a whole of some German Turks and hated as an autocracy by others.
Deptford collision: Sicklist killed in a car collision
A cyclist is killed in a collision like with a car in London.
The collision took place in the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a traveling road in Deptford southeast of the city, about 10.15 BST.

The Metropolitan Police said the police were working to identify the man and notify the relatives.
Road locks and bus circulations are in place, and carists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in rebellions
Six prison officers have been injured in an incident of a high-security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Rebellions broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09.30 BST on Sunday and still ongoing.

And last October, the rebellion police was invited to handle a serious event where the employees were attacked with biljard balls.
The orchestra Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with floods (may be favourable for dry areas)
It's the shield Arizona is hit by a tropical luxury, but it's probably going to happen early next week, where the remaining force of the orchestra Rosa moves through the desert areas in the southwest and brings flood dangers.
National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will move in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and that the rainstorm will start late Monday evening.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has noted on Twitter that only "three tropical cyclones have maintained the status as a tropical storm or lprint within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra until it was 65 km from the border to Arizona.’
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm rainfall, with up to 15 cm some places in Mongolon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas within the southwest desert, including the centre of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin mountain chain, are likely to have between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm rainfall is possible in some areas.
For those outside flood dangers, Rosa may be a blessing because the area suffers from drought.
Although floods are a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be favourable, as the Southwest United States is currently in a dry state.
According to the United States Dry Monitor, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drying, which is the second highest category’, according to weather.com.
First, the orchestra Rosa hits land at the Mexican Peninsula Baja California.
Rosa still has the worm force Sunday morning, with a maximum wind power of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving 19 km/h.
The storm meets cold waters in the Pacific, thus losing power.
It is therefore expected to meet Mexico with a tropical storm force on Monday evening or afternoon.
The precipitation over parts of Mexico may be strong and cause great flood hazards.
«Total rainfall of 7,5 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with possibilities of up to 25 cm rainfall» according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm to it hit the border of Arizona formal Tuesday morning as a tropical luminaire, which this moves through Arizona and into the southern Utah in late Tuesday night.
‘The head father expected by Rosa or the remainder of it is very strong rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the south-west desert in the United States’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening floods and fluid rush and fast in the desert and soil scraps in mountain areas.

Trump says that Kavanaugh has ‘ suffered under the minority and mind’ of the democratic party.
‘A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the disgusting and shocking tactics of the democratic party’, said Trump in front of a national meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has ‘ suffered under the minority and mind’ to the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, and denied strong and emotional charges from Christine Blasey Ford that he committed a sexual offense against her several decades ago when they were teens.
Ford is also witnessed about his accusation during the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw how brilliant, good and courageous" Kavanaugh was that day.
‘A voice to support Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to support one of the most practicing lawyers of our day, with pledges of public service,’ he told a assembly of his supporters in Western Virginia.
The President referred discretion to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for the Republicans to vote at the intermediate elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of our most important choices in our lifetime.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
"That's why I'm going around and fighting for the best candidates."
Trump believed that the democrats were aimed at ‘resisting and preventing’.
The Senate's first intermediate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place at the latest on Friday, as the assistant of a Chairman of the Republican Party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian screws and tsunami, numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged out to the sea by huge waves that thundered to the beaches when a great earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slavesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday, then up to six feet high waves thundered in land around sunset, destroyed everything in their way and drove many into the drunk death.
The tsunami came in the heels of a earthquake with strength 7.5.
“When the tsunamifare occurred yesterday, people were still running on the beach, not immediately escaped and ended up as victims”, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia’s crisis management etat (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The Tsunami was not alone – it brought cars, trees and houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho, and suggested that the tsunami had moved over the open sea in a speed of 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Somebody climbed into trees to flee from the tsunami and survived.’;»
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the Crisis Management Site showed many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and broken bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The afterquake continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquake account could be known by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) stated in a declaration that the force of Friday's huge earthquake was about 200 times more than the power of the nuclear bomb that was released over Hiroshima during World War II.
The location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bough may have increased the tsunami, according to the etat.
Nugroho described the damages as ‘greater’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
The likes of some of the victims were found caught in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 people were damaged and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death figures and damages may be larger land coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication “was completely crocheted, completely without information” from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
There lives more than 300 000 people there," said the Red Cross in a press release, and added that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
‘This is already a tragedy, but it may get much worse.’
On Saturday, the site was strongly criticised not to have informed that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had taken before the warning was issued.
In an amateur recording divided by social media, a man in the top floor of a building is hearing call desperate warnings that the tsunami approaches passing on the street below.
In a few minutes, a wall of water thunders to the beach, and rivers with buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to authenticate the recordings immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major stream break that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The military has begun to send transport aeroplanes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated still desperately need food and other needs.
The city aerodrome is opened for assistance only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo shall visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The deaths following tsunami in Indonesia increase more than 800.
It's totally cruel.
World Visions staff from Donggala have come safely to the Palu center, where they have searched for lie under the parking centre in front of their office, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of destroyed houses," he said.
It's totally cruel.
When auxiliary organisations began the distressing preparations for the provision of emergency aid, some complained that foreign assistants with a lot of expertise were refused to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, money, supplies and workers from abroad may not be released into a crisis area until it has been declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
‘There is still a provinceal disaster’, said Aulia Arriani, a speaker of Indonesian Red Cross.
'When the government says 'Greit, this is a national disaster', we can open the limits of international assistance, but the situation has not been status yet.'
When the sun goes down over Palu for the second time after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing are among the miracles that light up the dark news picture of tragic natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a cloak.
On Sunday, a woman was liberated by rescue crews after spending two days caught under ruins with the body of her mother next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paraglids for Asialeks, which had been carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those caught in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandagi, were also his students.
"As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional should bearing," he said.
Gendon told us that in the hours after the news about the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding environment, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the actors who participated in the Palu Beach Festival.
But the messages only led to gray bows, rather than a few blue bows.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal USD 26 750 under minibankfilling in Newport on the Levee

Canye West: The Rapper changes his name to Ye
The Rapper Kanye West changes his name – to Ye.
When he announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The creation formerly known as Kanye West."
West (41) has had the nickname Ye over a long time, and used the name as the title of its eighth album, which was launched in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will launch his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she cancelled on "emotional basis", according to the serial creator.
In addition to being a abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious significance to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, when he discussed the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, that's us.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye -- as a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a representation of who we are.»
He's one of many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has previously cooperated with West, has also varied between the use of binder lines and upper case letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's admission president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he should never use military power against civilians when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody receptions against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he “never will ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people”.
Military troops shot against a peaceful demonstration on the square of October 2, 1968 and killed as many as 300 people, during a period when left-political student movements were rotten across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead youths into criminal bendes.
The United States should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the USA should double the amount they spend on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, investor and performer of artificial intelligence, which has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have made announcements about artificial intelligence, despite the fact that the United States in general does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, on its side, introduced a plan last year and aimed to be number 1 in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
"A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough," said Lee.
Double financial support can double the chance of the next major performance of artificial intelligence from the United States," Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is Director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most important companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that struck the US's best Othello player, and later was a director of Microsoft Research or Director of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee recognized the former technology competitions of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next will be held, to help find the next generation of wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive state appropriations, according to Lee.
"It's not China that steals the academic leaders, it's the companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed wise heads from the universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen their efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I believe that those who have a degree of artificial intelligence should receive an offer for a residence permit automatically," he said.
China's State Council issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation finances people at academic institutions, in a similar way as the National Science Foundation and other State organisations share money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, according to Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Defence Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and academy, and the White House announced the establishment of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of USD 2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
As regards NSF, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, the US law aimed at establishing a national Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been stopped for several months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether the country’s name should be changed
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country’s name to ‘The Republic of North Macedonia’ in order to resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour represents a requirement for Greek territory and has put veto to include them in the NATO and the EU.
The two governments entered into an agreement in June based on the proposed new naval, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the slaves of the Macedonian majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boicotting campaign has raised doubts if the meeting will meet the minimum requirement of 50 per cent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question of the voting sentence is: ‘Is you for NATO and EU membership by approving the agreement with Greece.’
Those who support the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, one country which occurred after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU protective paraply, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it will probably be crucial because a large number of Members have said that they will comply with the results of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-third majority of Parliament.
The state’s election commission said they had not received any irregularity reports by 13 p.m.
However, the meeting was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent at previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered electors gave their vote.
"I came to vote because of my children – we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The folk vote in Macedonia is about changing the country's name to open the doors for them to be members of the NATO and the EU.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) clarified a small scene and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who were to go to the vote.
"We are positive to the NATO and the EU, but we will be notified with a raised head, not being released in the backway," says Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have valued ours.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asiatic integration.»
Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead to an incredible investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think most people will be for, because more than 80 of our people want us to join the EU and NATO," says Zaev after voting.
He says that a "yes" answer will be "a confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute for Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the eligible voters will participate in the referendum – this is lower than the required meeting.
Another study, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of the respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these 70 percent said they came to vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the meeting must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle that the pro-west government has encountered since it took over May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero manoeuvers past the whole Brightons defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 winners on Saturday at Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a measure for 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attacker received a passion at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran about the race with three Brighton defences before he got out on the open path.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He came around one defender before he ran from several at the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a passion to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used right shoes to hit Brightons keeper Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the network.
‘Aguero still struggles with some foot problems’, said the City Manager Pep Guardiola to the press.
"We talked about his coming to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was lucky that he scored a measure just then.»
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage of the Premier League battle.
This target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in the area of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough passing along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the network just before it was over the death line.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be spoiler for Rockies
Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and have no reason to bet strongly.
But only if it can affect the playoff options of the Colorado team, which leads over Los Angeles Dodgers with one battle in NL West.
Rockies got a wild card-place with a 5-2 victory over the National Friday night, but are still out to secure its first division title.
Although we don't have anything to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the mood here in Denver, with the audience and the second team, will be the most likely thing to be the highest level of battle I can play on this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in it?’
The Nationals have still not advertised their starting pitcher for Sunday, but must certainly be likely to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, which in that case is starting pitcher for 34th time, had a bullet session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has won 18 matches and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 rounds.
Trump's National Assembly in West Virginia
The President referred to discretion on the situation around the highest court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh as he talked about the importance of the republikans voting at the intermediate elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a participant, but I'm a participant.
Trump continued: "You see this cruel, cruel group of radical democrats, you see it happens right now.
And they're determined to take the power back at any price, and there you see the slightness and the badness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to override to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we shall not give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, are aimed at "resisting and preventing".
"And you'll see it over the last four days," he said, and he called the Democrats "sick and malicious and ugly and dishonest".
He referred to the Senate court committee and mentioned the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein by name, on which the audience bowed audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um no, I'm waiting for one – it was very bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen.»
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who say their opinion
When momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, there was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last one in a large number of Labour parliamentary members who have been told that we are not welcome, just because we say what we mean.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semittism.
In my case, I was to be sentenced because I was not in agreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
As regards how important it is to have accountable economic policies, with regard to national security, about Europe – ironically enough similar matters that they Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
On Friday’s request for the Nottingham East Labour meeting, it was stated that ‘we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings at Friday evenings have been just this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of 'smoother, friendlyer' policies is too long forgotten if it at all began.
It is increasingly evident that different opinions are not allowed in the working party and all opinions are judged based on whether they are acceptable for the partial management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues earlier thought that I shared many political attitudes suddenly began to expect me to take an U-swing and stand for opinions I never had agreed before, they were in the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn't have anything to say to me – I receive a bunch of bad messages on social media that require me to be disposed of, condemn centre policy and tell me that I shouldn't join Labour.
And it's not just me who's experienced this.
I know I'm lucky one of my colleagues, because the comments I usually receive are political.
I know how professional and targeted these colleagues are when they meet a sea that gender-discriminatory and racist comments every day, but never let themselves cough.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalisation of rough discretion.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the working party should promote a tolerance culture.
The truth is that we no longer are such a lot that is open to everyone, and every suggestion of mistrust and any change in the rules of election becomes narrower.
I have received many advice in the last two years when I am encouraged to keep my head low and not raise my voice so much, because it will "make everything better".
But that's not why I was involved in politics.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school student, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had led to my classroom at the public school I went on was literally complete, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most, both as local council and minister of government.
I have never hid my political opinions, nor by previous choice.
No one in Nottingham East may in any way have misunderstood my political attitudes or disagreements with the current management.
To those who submitted the representative's proposal on Friday, I just want to say that since the country is raising our way towards a Brexit that will harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand and understand the desire to waste time and forces on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But the message I really want to communicate is not to Nottingham Momentum -- it's to those I represent, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud of serving you, and I promise that no threats of deliberation or political compromise will prevent me from doing what I think best respects their interests.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Unfetched Ayr rises to top
Two later trials have changed the final result a little bit, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this amazing entertaining Tentent's Premiership battle.
They're now on the top of the table, and they're the only unowned of the ten.
Finally, there was as much of their superior defence as their ability to use the possibilities they received that led to the home to lose the winner, and trainer Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been challenged in our fights so far and are still unquestioned, so I have to be satisfied with that," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "All honor to Ayr, they were better to use the possibilities than we were."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, with the target park from Frazier Climo gave Ayr the leadership, but a yellow card to the Scotlandscapetein Rory Hughes, borrowed from Warriors, made Melrose compliant with the position, and Jason Baggot performed an experiment without a target park.
Climo strengthened Ayr's management with a punishment park before he, just before breaking, scored and target parcel a solo attempt to change the position to 17-5 at a break.
But Melrose started the second half strongly, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, with the target park from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a longer stay in connection with a serious damage to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried out on stock, and from the restart the Ayr management increased even more ed a trial from Stafford McDowell, with the target park from Climo.
Ayr's working captain, Blain Macpherson, then got yellow card and Melrose used it to have an extra man on the path to the full with a trial from Bruce Colvine without a target park, at the end of a period of high pressure.
The home team nevertheless returned strongly, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have caught Climo when he had not the ball, MacPherson accomplished a touchdown at the entering behind the prominent Ayr-maul.
Climo accomplished a target park, as he did again almost completely from restart, after Kyle Rowe retrieved David Armstrong's box park and sent flanks Gregor Henry courts for the fifth attempts of the home team.
Still The Game Star is ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the Still Game Star Ford Kieran is on the way into the service industry – it was recently discovered that he was named as the director of a restaurant company with scarce appropriation.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays on the popular BBC program, for which he writes manus and plays together with his long-term comedie partner, Greg Hemphill.
You have announced that the next ninth season will be the last series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress wouldn't comment on the matter, but a source from The Scottish Sun suggested that the Kiernan wanted to engage in Glasgow's 'lively restaurant industry'.
"The Sea is ours": Bolivia, a country without a coastal line, hopes the court will open the road to the Pacific
Seemen patrol a riggin decked marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea-blue flag.
Marine bases from the Titicaca lake to Amazonas are decorated with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.’
The whole country of Bolivia has still freshly remembered the coastal line they lost to Chile during a bloody conflict of resources in the 18th century, and the country is longing to be able to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be larger than they have been in decades since Bolivia is waiting for a knowledge of the International Court on 1 October after five years of discussion.
‘Bolivia has power, Community spirit and mind rest and, of course, expects the result with a positive attitude’, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the knowledge of the International Court on a large-screen in many different places in the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will give its knowledge in favour of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of sudden negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's carismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial re-elective campaign next year, has also put a lot into the sense of Monday.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised late August.
But some analysts believe that the court would hardly take Bolivia's party, and that very little would change if it had done so.
The United Nations Agency, which was held in the Netherlands, has no authority allowing them to dispose of Chilen rural areas and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the knowledge of the International Court comes only six months after the last arguments were heard, states that the case was "not complicated", according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years could actually have done things worse.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been addressed by the current Bolivian administration’, said Zárate.
She believes that Morale's antagonist retorics have eliminated any remaining kindness on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the negotiations at some point, but it would be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia at the Hague, rejected the theory that the decision of the Court came unusually quickly.
According to him, on Monday, Bolivia will give “a extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile” and the possibility of“setting a stop for 139 years of disagreement, to the benefit of both parties”.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America, has used the maritime situation as a political shell.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific”, he added.
“The knowledge is an opportunity to see what we need to do to overcome the past.”
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never defeat its nuclear weapons if they cannot trust US authorities.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He invited the United States to comply with the promises they gave during a meeting between the leaders of the two contradictory countries in Singapore.
These comments come at the same time as US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be ready to start the fixed atomic diplomacy, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "woman dream" that continued penalties and American opposition against is the declaration that ends the Korean war will ever force North Korea to knee.
American authorities are skeptical to accept the declaration without the first implementation of significant disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and Donald Trump, the President of the United States, both want another meeting.
But there is a widespread doubt about whether Pyongyang really plans to release a arsenal country probably looks like the only security guarantee they have.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another meeting between Kim and Trump.
Mote shows in Paris reveal the last in huge headache, which is on the way to a clothes shop near you
If you want some big additions to the hat collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't have to search anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne declined a selection of strange, over-dimensional headpieces as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the moteleves on the moteuca in Paris.
Very unpractical hats have been popular at Instagram in summer, and these designers have sent the incredible creatures down their catwalk.
Valentino's most perceptive plaque was an excessive beige hat decorated with a spring-like broad brake that drowned the heads of the models.
Other over-dimensional accessories included jewelry-produced water melons, a trollman hat or even an ananas, but they are not made to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also declined a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had reproved lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last shout.
One creative memory of diving equipment, including snorkels and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in cakes.
And if you're looking for even more big fashion accessories, you're lucky.
Style experts predict that the huge hats may be on the way to a clothes store near you.
The over-dimensional hats come right in the heels of La Bomba, the strap hat with a half-meter wide brake that has been viewed on all and everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the very unpractical hat dominated social media has now sent another large creation down the catwalk – a beach cleaner in straw that is almost the same size as the bath-treatment model wearing on it.
The orange raffinadery, which is bordered with raffinates and complemented with a white rail handle, was the most visible creation in the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at moteuca in Paris.
The expert Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the clothing shops next summer – when the designer has had such an impact, it would be difficult to overlook the demand for overdimensional accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for world citizens
Scotland fresh schools continue to show academic excellence, and this has persisted in 2018 with more than one year of excellent exam results, which are supported by individual and common success in sport, art, music and other societal actions.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools, have more than 30 000 students throughout Scotland, working hard to provide the best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their position as world citizens.
As an educational body that can design and implement a tailored school course, we see that modern languages are still a popular and demanded choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, when the words of his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words of his heart reach.»
This is a strong reminder that we can not just keep us to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the year's exam results, we see that languages are at the top of the table with the highest percentage of the survival of fresh oils.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received exam character A.
The data obtained from the 74 member schools of the Free School Council showed that 72 percent of students received the graduate A in mandarin, while 72 percent of the students who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received A.
This illustrates that fresh schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a decisive skill of children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as professional elections are now valued at the same level as real-discipline as natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics for fresh schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that, for the reasons why employers claimed to have problems with occupation of a vacant job, 17% could be attributed to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly important to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities require language skills, these skills become crucial in a globalised world.
If you have learned a second language, these lifelong skills will give real benefits in the future, regardless of what career you choose.
Communicating directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a advance of competition.
According to a YouGov survey answered by more than 4000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were incapable of speaking a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a 2-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
This is why investment in language training is now essential for today's children.
Knowing more languages, especially those associated with emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches in different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most valuable for the United Kingdom on the road to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested, there will always be a range of languages to choose between on fresh schools, with teachers who are experts in this area.
Scottish fresh schools aim to create a learning environment that will prepare the children and equipped them with the knowledge and ability they need to succeed, regardless of what the future brings.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as ‘international communication capacity’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity and excellence for Scotland youths.
Il faut bee le faire.

LeBron will have his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting time is almost over to fans who want to see LeBron James play for Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
The Lakers-Trenger Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's first season's opening fight against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's going to play is still not decided.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trundell wrote on Twitter that James probably will play a limited number of minutes.
After a exercise earlier this week, James was asked what plans he had for Lakers' six-players' early season plan.
"I don't need pre-song matches at this stage of my career," he replied.
Time of Trump's People's Meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President starts a number of electoral meetings tonight Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned people meetings in the next week, including stops in cities where he has much support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his selected Supreme Candidate has been put on hold, Trump aims to obtain support for the coming intermediate elections, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of the Congress when the electors go to the voting urns in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia People's Meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's People's Meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia will start at 19.00 a.m. tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's People's Meeting in West Virginia on the Internet below via direct streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss the week's consultations for the highest law-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual abuse. A expected confirmation vote is set on waiting for up to one week while the FBI investigates the matter.
The main objective of all these people's meetings is to support Republicans who face a challenging election in November.
President Trump has therefore said that in the next few weeks, these five national meetings aim to ‘educate volunteers and supporters, trying to protect and extend the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Reuters’,’ according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so vital for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible while moving towards a travel campaign season”, Reuters was heard by a Trump campaigner who did not want to be named.
The Native Meeting of the Night, which, according to the plan, will take place at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh Press” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time during the last month of Trump visited West Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Senate Candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is following the opinion measurements.
"It is a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a lift on the measurements," said Simon Haeder, a expert on political science at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Cleaner Cup 2018: Team USA shows battle spirit to keep faith as they enter Sunday single game
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may have been exactly the year's Ryder Cup needed.
The momentum's fluctuating pendulum is a fully dictated sport concept, but yet what the players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
"They led with six points and now there are four, so we're well carrying it with us as a little momentum," said Jordan Spieth when he left the path for the day.
Europe will, of course, have the advantage – they lead with four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, the Americans feel that they have got some wind in the sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tea to green, and manager by example.
The deep celebrations became higher as his round continued, and dropped to a decisive putting to raise the match to ambiguous when he and Thomas lay two under after two.
His putting, who won them the match of 15, was met with a similar shout – by the sort that shows that he still does not believe that the American team is unlikely.
"We really just have to put all the cloths on and focus on our own match," said Spieth.
That's all of these players have now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who have received more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, which undoubtedly is Clearer Cup's great success story.
Europe's unusual but glorious pairs have four out of four and do not make a foot mistake.
“Moliwood” was the only couple that escaped a bookey Saturday afternoon, and also escaped bogey’s Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to move both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are Sunday's largest competitors, and there are no other players the audience will also see a European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Everything prefers both at the same time, in each of their holes.
It is still too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson shammed easily up with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-balls-hero when he was a partner with Alex Noren.
After one bogey and two doubles during the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish were so far on a decline that they had no nubbejans to take back the jump.
But on Sunday there's no help to get.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to look closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can turn in a moment.
Europe has played better as a layer so far, and is far ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the team of the United States has missed the battle spirit of some, especially in the United States.
Europe leads 10 to 6 at the beginning of the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe will have a strong advance at the beginning of Ryder Cups last day, after h completed Sunday's four-ball and foursomes matches with 10-6 leaderships against the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari guided with two victories against a degraded Tiger Woods, and raised its score for Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, who fights to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's four-balls and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more opposition in foursomes and won two matches, but they didn't have to take any of the advanced.
Jim Furyk's side has to get eight points from Sunday's 12 single games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European smoke that has received four points in a row, and he and Molinari – who together got the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend – are the only couple who have received four points from his first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they collaborated in a seamless way to beat down Woods and the American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with even more remarkable 5&4.
Woods, who stopped through two matches on Saturday, glimpted to inside, but has now lost 19 of its 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested to the morning's fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stevensen in foursomes and accomplished a 2&1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, which is ranked as number one and three on the world basis.
But Europe did not get everything they wanted on this warm day with light brising southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, who won majors three times, set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a hard fight over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and came back later to hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4/3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only two times in Ryder Cup's history, a team has been able to get in after a four-point advance at the start of the single game, but as the current holders only need Furyk's side to reach an odd to keep the trophy.
But after being the second best for two days, it doesn't seem that they will be able to deliver a counter attack on Saturday.
North Korea will ‘in no way’ agree on unilateral disarmament without trust
The North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations on Saturday that continued penalties strengthened the distrust against the United States, and that the country would in no way agree to release its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that North Korea has carried out “decisive welwill measures” in the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, decombining the nuclear test area and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We have nevertheless not seen any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not in any circumstances unilaterally disarmament ourselves first."
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints on Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual disarmament, but his declaration was important because it did not completely reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done earlier.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting between a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work against the "atomic disarmament of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea has demanded a formal end of the Korean war that took place from 1950 to 53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first release its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to reduce strict international penalties against North Korea.
‘USA insists on ‘atomic disarmament first’ and raises the pressure through penalties to achieve its objective by force and even contradicts the ‘declaration of the end of war’, according to Ri.
"The belief that penalties can force us in the knee is a dream for people who don't know anything about us.
The problem is, however, that the penalties continue to create further mistrust.’
Ri did not mention the plans of another hit between Kim and Trump as the U.S. leader underlined before the United Nations before the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If the other party to this disarmament case was South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been as fixed as it is."
However, the tone for Ri's speech was very different from the last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack against the United States of America with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after "Herr Onde President" Trump called Kim a "raketer" on a suicide mission.
After threatening "full destruction" of North Korea last year, Trump stood before the United Nations this year and praised Kim to be courageous enough to take disarmament steps, but said that a lot of work remains, and the penalties must remain applicable until North Korea is nuclear degraded.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he had no time frame for this, and said that "It has nothing to say if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures undertaken.
But US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's penalties still need to be strictly and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously increased the penalties against North Korea since 2006 in order to strike the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons programme.
Pompeo met Ri on the side lines of the UN General Assembly, and then said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not work well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had progress, but only hours after the accused North Korea him for having come with "passive demands".
North Korea undertook a meeting with Moon this month to set up a missile area and a nuclear weapon facility if the United States did ‘similar measures’.
He said Kim had said that these "similar measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course to get enough rest
A new course at the Harvard University this year will help the students get more sleep by dealing with the growing uncultural to blow through the night with caffeine incubations as fuel.
One academic found out that students at the best university in the world often did not think about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after having a talk about the effect of sleep shortages on learning.
"After the talk a girl came to me and said, "Why has no one said this before?"
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and it surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains the importance of good sleep habits to perform academic and sports, and for the general state.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at the Harvard Medical School and adm. dir. for the university health services, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw the students suffered from serious sleep shortages.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in a bedroom where students can click on coffee cups, gardins, jogging shoes and books and hear about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by a lack of sleep and how important it is with a sleep routine.
Otherwise, participants are told how long-term sleep shortage can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons makes participants think about their own daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not change the students' behavior immediately.
But we think they have the right to know about this, as you have the right to know about the risk of smoking," said Professor Czeisler.
There is still a certain proudness in being able to puff all night, he said, and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on the students led to an increasing problem of sleep.
Enough and good sleep should be the “secret weapons” of the students against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said – even as a means of weight gaining, as sleep shortage puts the brain in hunger mode, which leads to constant famine.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped professor Czeisler develop the course. He took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course inspired him to work for a course that was available for the whole campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all the master students to take a similar study programme before they are registered at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students put on an alarm when they were to lay as well as when they were to stand up and that they had to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights. This type of light can disturb the daily rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Measures of Menga cutting out Gerrard's men
Rangers probably suffered a disappearance when Dolly Mengas target hit Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 on Livingston.
The Ibrox page wanted to get its first victory since February's victory 4–1 at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's other loss of 18 struggles as manager and left since his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and Rangers never managed to compensate.
Rangers now fall down in the sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to the third and is behind the Hibernian on target difference.
There may be more trouble in yeast for Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head damage after an object was thrown from the remote public.
Gerrard made eight exchanges on the team, which celebrated by Ayr and into the Betfred Cup symphilias.
Holt, on the other hand, went for the same Livi 11 who took a point from Heart's last week, and he would've been happy how his rolling team hit the opponents.
Rangers might have the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored only two minutes into the battle when Mengas first care sent Scott Pittman through at Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle player lost the chance.
A long frishes park of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defence partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot against the target.
Rangers took control, but it looked as if their game lent more on hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a punishment park after a quarter, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but judge Steven Thomson rejected this.
Rangers only managed two shots on targets in the first round, but former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly did not have any problems with Lassana Coulibalys head and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livis opening for 34 minutes may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserve it for the struggle.
Again, Rangers could not handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his head called when he chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent in the break, and the player switch gave immediate results when the wings player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston managed to make the away players play exactly the kind of battle they like, where Lithgow and Halkett caught up a long ball after a long ball.
Holt's side could have stretched the leadership in the last round, but McGregor stood up against Jacob's before Lithgow's head from the corner.
Rangers payer Glenn Middleton probably had a late demand for a punishment park when he was in conflict with Jacobs, but again saw Thomson away.
Almanac: Inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" almanac: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, was the day when the future physician Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Gegers developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the apparatus we today know as the geiger counter.
The Geiger teller has been an important part of science since then, and also became part of the popular culture through the 1950 "Bells of Coronado" film, with the scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What in the world is it?"
Rogers: «It's a geiger teller; it finds radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you take these headphones, you can hear the effect of the atoms that radioactivity in the minerals gives.»
Evans: 'Shall say it's sound now!'
His Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But the invention he named, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells and kill them
vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them into a laboratory
The cells can ‘see’ a protein common to many cancers and then inject into the patient again
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, learning the immune system to recognize cancer cells, experienced that the ovarian cancer she suffered was disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, typically for many cancers, and then injecting these cells into the patient again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘driver growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells were taken from the patient and “trained” to address cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Canye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came with a strong defense of Trump after the SNL action.
It didn't work well.
Canye West was bowed in a studio at Saturday Night Live after a familiar appearance in which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would still be elected in 2020.
After carrying out his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, dressed a Make America Great Again-hat, he longed out against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
"It happens so often that I talk to a white person, and then he says, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
If I were afraid of racism, I had moved from the United States long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star fooled Brett Kavanaugh's explanation to the Senate Judicial Committee of the charges of sexual abuse presented by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording was uploaded by West to social media by comic Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock wanted to ridiculate West by putting out the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he was hearing it in the back room about choice of headpiece.
"They mocked me.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They knocked me!
And then they said I don't understand what reality is," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Will you see that I understand what the reality is?" he said, and he said that he should "take on me the Supermann cap, because then no one can say what to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Try love.’»
His comments were bowed at least twice, and the employees who worked at the SNL looked foolish, Variety, where a staff member said: ‘The whole studio became still still.’
West was brought in as the last little replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, when her girlfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he presented the song “I Love It” dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of our most courageous: TAK TO THAT YOU STORE IMOT MASSENE."
But talk showvert Karen Hunter twisted that West is just "the one he is and it's totally amazing".
"But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothes or supporting his "art" which I mean cultivating and spraying out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
We are also," she added.
Before the show, the raper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name. He said that from now on he was "the crew formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change name and now follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper colleague Snoop Dogg has had the name Snoop Lion.
Visited for murder trials for knife picking at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been aimed at killing attempts after a man was knitted on a restaurant east of Belfast on Friday.
The event happened in Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
It is expected to be presented to the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The sight will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington longs out against "great maskulinity"
Kit Harington is known from the role as the swordsvinger Jon Snow in HBO's violent imaginary series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actress has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and says such roles on movies often cause young men to think they must be hard to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something went wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of "toxic maskulinity" in these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones colleague Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, realized that he was very busy with the theme.
"It concerns me quite much at present – where did it go wrong with the maskulinity?" he said.
‘How have we trained men in view of the problems we see now?’
Kit believes that TV may have part of the blame for the increase in "toxic maskulinity" because of the strong maskulin roles.
He continued: "What is inborn and what is allowed?
What is being transmitted on TV and on the street, what makes young boys feel that they have to cultivate just this side by being a man?
I think it's one of the really big questions of our time -- how can we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.’
In the interview, he also admits that he will not make any precursor or follower of the Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and he says he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play the main role in a new recording by Sam Shepard True West. This is the story of a film manufacturer and his brother, who is a ranner.
The actress recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife during the recordings, so it came something good out of it -- my future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kits role figure Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy-Price-Price-Please-Please Series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14 % increase in new cases
China has reported a total increase of 14 % in the number of inhabitants living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are affected in the country, says the health representative.
Approximately 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China by blood transmitting infections.
But the number of people who get HIV in this way is closer to zero, said Chinese health staff at a conference in the Yunnan province.
However, annually, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men, after each marriage with women.
Many of the disease infections are due to insufficient protection of sex in these circumstances.
Since 2003, China’s authorities have promised general access to HIV medicine as part of a measure to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the employee’s leakage of data on Republican senators, flashes of ‘hazardous lies’ and ‘conspiratory theories’
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected Saturday accusations that members of her staff had given the personal information to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democracy insured by the claims was presented by ‘ultraconservative’ commentators and websites.
“Laughs, lies and more rejective lies” said Waters in an opinion on Twitter.
The published information was reported to include the home addresses and telephone numbers of the U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a panel hearing at Senate on the offense charges against the highest court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came a little after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address of the source behind the article was tracked to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of the Waters staff, according to Hill.
‘This unjustified accusation is completely incorrect and a regular lie’ continued Waters.
"The members of my staff - who have received their identity, personal data and security compromised as a result of these unreasonable and false accusations - had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unjustified accusation is completely incorrect and a regular lie.’;
Waters' opinion was rapidly criticised on the web, among others by former press secretary of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial is aggressive’, said Fleischer.
‘This indicates that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, they don't have to be aggressive.
They can't go in defense.
They must not confuse the motives of the prosecutor.
They must act calmly and conceived.’;
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing aggressively during the Thursday consultation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to remove Waters in the intermediate elections, also air his thoughts on Twitter.
‘Store — if true’, he twisted.
In its opinion, Waters said that her office had announced "relevant authorities and the police about these false accusations".
“We will ensure that the acting persons are revealed”, she continued, “and that they are held responsible for all actions that are destructive and dangerous for each of my staff”.
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again – bloodless Rowan Atkinson in spy parodie
It has become a tradition now to look for Brexit hints in all new films with a British shining and it seems to be relevant for this re-release of the parodifranchisen Johnny English action comedie – which started in 2003 with Johnny English and resumed in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sarcastic suicide about how obviously hopeless we are to become the nation's new export product?
at least, the incompetent Johnny English with his bumping eyes and the rubber face has been renewed his license to rotate it for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comic figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking kinopublicum.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a mix of Clouseau, a dance Mr. Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes with one single note in the music entry with fire car theme during the opening ceremony at the OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the role of Atkinson played in the forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveling and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
There's one and another great moment in the last Johnny English race.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in middle armor and the rotor leaves cut his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedie comes to its right, but the humor feels quite bloodless and strangely excessive, especially now that the "serious" brands as 007 and Mission Impossible willingly away have elements of comedie.
The humor seems to be more focused on children than adults, and for me, Johnny English's fades are not as inventive and peeled as the stump film lions of Mr. Bean.
The current prediction is that the United Kingdom is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super secret web network of spys in the United Kingdom and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the guardian agent – a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop for a Prime Minister, a pompous and depressed figure that's already undergoing a complete crisis of political unopularity: Emma Thompson does a very good job with this as-theresa-May role, but the manus doesn't give her much to work with.
Her advisers inform that since each active spy has been revealed, she must collect some of the retired.
And that means the clever Johnny English, who is now learning work at a snobbed etablissement, but gives unofficial instruction in secret information, there are some artful sequences here, when English offers a rocka academy for spy activity.
English is snapped back to Whitehall for a quick orientation and reunited with his old, plagued helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, spited with a subcommandant, a hysterical superclass lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little disposed of.
So the Batman and Robin style of rotting everything to the Queen's mission are back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko with amazing five fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is conveyed by the carismatic technology millarder that claims that he can solve the British cyber problems: the stupid Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start the journey with farsi-like side jumps: pre-clear as servants they put the guys on a punching French restaurant. They create chaos while they hide on board Volta's luxuryacht; and English triggers the pure anarchy when he attempts to use a VR headset to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really pulled out before the last sequence, but yet so loving and noisy it is, there's a lot that reminds of child TV with the whole thing.
It's pretty moderate, it's all.
And like with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't think but, could the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really gets used his talent?
Labour denies the preparation of plans to allow the British to work four-day sick but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party shall assess a radical plan that will give the British four-day working week – but pay for five.
The batch would evidently allow operators to use savings on the revolution of artificial intelligence by giving workers an extra day of the week free.
This will cause the employees to receive a three-day weekend, while receiving the same wages.
Sources say that the idea fits into the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of workers.
The trade unions support the transition to four-day sickness so that workers can also benefit from the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen during the night, but the four-day week is an ambition that matches the party's wish to make the penalty vary to the benefit of the workers — in addition to the overall industrial strategy of the party’.
Labour will not be the first to support such an idea. Green Party promised four-day sickness during the campaign before parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the tank is not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A speaker for Labour said, "A four-day sick is not the party's policy and is not an assessment by the party".
Financial policy speaker for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to deepen his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw the power of ‘sightless directors’ and ‘profits’ of public service providers.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders in aquatic companies are at risk of not recovering the entire share item because a Labour government can ‘retract’ from perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the company boards and set up employee funds to transfer 10 % of equity to private sector companies to employees, which may receive an annual dividend of 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" about the FBI review of Kavanaugh can make them change their opinion
The FBI review of the accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has suspended a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question whether the finding of the Agency may cause some Republican senators to change their vision.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than the colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the accusations came out and asked, "Do you?
He was determined, squeezeful, unambiguous.’;
However, Graham’s voice seems to have been cut into stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and if so, it must be a surprising discovery," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it energyfully," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of them she mentioned could not confirm it.
It's been 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to combating poverty?
This Saturday is New York host for the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music arrangement that has an impressive list of stars to act and a similarly impressive assignment; eradicate the world's poverty.
Global Citizen Festival, which is now in its seventh year, will cause thousands of people to flow to the great plenary of Central Park, not only to experience sizes like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness about the real goal of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international action group that hopes to combat poverty by making more people actively work against poverty.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to carry out a number of tasks, or ‘actions’ such as voluntary work, send e-mail to a world leader, take a phone or in other meaningful ways to increase awareness of their targets of eradication of poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been when it is now only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to get people to fight for changes, or just enough a case of so-called "clicktivism" -- that people feel great by signing a signature campaign on the web or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have recorded more than 19 million ‘actions’ from the trailers, with a range of different objectives.
They say that these actions have contributed to making world leaders declare commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars that will improve the situation for more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and announcements resulting from their operations, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding has had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main engagements are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the United Kingdom that will “help children to exploit their full potential” and promised to give Rwanda $35 million to contribute to the eradication of malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweetes from Global Citizens.
"With support from the British Government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice with undernutrition to a footnote in history," said the Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd under a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions in the United Kingdom to get better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition measures.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the website, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The global citizen replied: "There will be a long and difficult way – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the important citizens' rights and the anti-apart movements before us, we will succeed because we stand stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who act at the year's event in New York, which will be guided by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the marine as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy sports - the Ministry of Industry
Washington may ‘if necessary’ to the marine in order to prevent Russian energy from exploring the markets, inter alia in the Middle East, the US Secretary of Industry, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examines.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially when operating on the invitation from the legal government – is a debt to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flap of Europe," he must have said.
And according to the speaker, there are always ways and means to handle this.
"The US has the possibility through the marine to ensure that seaways are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the arrangement held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal organisation that profiles itself as ‘the voice of the energy consumers’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, and he noted that they are far on their way.
‘The economic option to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel’, he said and referred to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with a economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The comments came after the Trump administration was on a tour to strengthen the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe. They want to replace Russia, the most affordable option for European consumers.
Consequently, employees of the Trump Administration, including the President himself, tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the ‘inappropriate’ project The North European gas pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the ‘catcher’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North European gas pipeline worth $11 billion, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
Kreml argues that Washington's glowing resistance to the project is only motivated for economic reasons and is an example of unreasonable competition.
"I think we have the same view that energy cannot be a press tool and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has met opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitments in the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have great problems with third countries that intervene in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the leader of the BDI after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will ‘think seriously’ on his presidential candidate for 2020, says senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think seriously" if she would still as a president candidate after the intermediate elections.
During a voter meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she wants to still.
"It is time for women to come to Washington and fix the shaken government, and it includes a woman at the top," she said, "The Hill.
‘After 6 November I want to consider seriously whether I should be a president.’
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the electoral meeting and said that he "led the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm worried to the margin about what Donald Trump is doing with democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we need an FBI review before the vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own choosers do not believe that she should still in 2020.
58 % of "probable" choosers in Massachusetts said that the senator should not stop, according to an opinion measurement from Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidate.
The measurement showed higher support to former governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidate and 48% was against it.
Other high-profiled democratic names discussed for a possible candidate tour in 2020 include Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The Biden said he wanted to decide officially by January, announced the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin pointer Track Palins PTSD during Trump's electoral meeting
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being arrived in the sept.
He was arrested and aimed at a home violence event Monday evening
"What my son goes through, what he goes through after coming home, I share with other families who experience the consequences of PTSD and some of the vulnerability that our soldiers have with her," she told the audience at a choice arrangement for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about the son and other war veterans: "They come home a bit changed, they come home the herd, they come home and wonder if this is the respect for what their soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and aimed for violence in the home of a woman, closure with a report on home violence and possession of a weapon while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police in Wasilla.
18 states and D.C. support tests of new asylum policies
eighteen states and the district of Columbia support a legal test of a new policy in the United States which refuses asylum to victims as a refugee from raid or home violence.
Representatives from the 18 States and D.C. submitted an orientation from amicus curiae (the friend of the court) in Washington to support a asylum seeker challenged policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Sessions case which the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that the partner ‘and his violent gentlemen’ abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her asylum request on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, who produce a large number of asylum seekers to the United States, as nations that have major problems with genius and home violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision by the Court of Appeal of Immigrants in 2014 which allowed undocumented immigrants as refugees from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In an opinion on Friday, State Advocate Karl Racine of the Columbia District said that the new policy ‘shes away from many decades of state, federal and international law’.
‘feeding law requires all asylum requirements to be determined on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the requirement, and such a ban is contrary to that principle’, said the orientation of amicus curiae.
The lawyers further argued in the orientation that the policy that refused access to immigrants harms the US economy and says that there is a great probability that they become entrepreneurs and ‘advocate with the necessary labour’.
Minister of Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer give asylum to victims as refugees from domestic violence and refugees in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave the home country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political vision’, said Sessions in the notice of 11 June on policy.
Asylum was never meant to reduce all the problems – even all serious problems – people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue action in Palu – the death figures are doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation became ever worse.
"It was very excited," says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her fever-sick son at a evacuation center in the confronted city of Palu.
‘The whole time you see ambulances that pick up the dead.
Pure water is inadequate’.
It was possible to see residents who came to destroyed homes and facilitated water damaged assets in an attempting to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were damaged and the hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake with strength 7.5 were overfilled.
Some of them damaged, including Dwi Haris, who broke the back and shoulder, sitting outside of Palus military hospitals, where patients were treated outdoors due to ongoing severe descendants.
He gets tears in his eyes when he recalls how it felt when the violent earthquake shake the hotel room in the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We had no time to save ourselves in security.
I was cut by the wall that broke together, I think," told Haris to the Associated Press, and added that the family was in the city to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then it became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of ‘trakassering’ with ‘propaganda advertising’
One week after a public Chinese newspaper drived a four-page ad in an American newspaper that scattered the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China Peking accused of using American presses to spread propaganda.
The United States President Donald Trump referred on Wednesday to the Annex China Daily paid to enter the Des Moines Register – the most selling newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China to try to intervene in the US Congress elections on 6 November, an accusation China rejects.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the elections in the United States, marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said American officials according to Reuters.
However, it is normal that foreign authorities use ads to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in an escalating trade war that has brought rounds with new rates of customs duties on each other's import products.
China's penalty duties early in the trade war would affect export companies in countries such as Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, report Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador in China and former many-year governor of Iowa, who is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader article in the Sunday Des Moines Register: "China now steps up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"With spreading this propaganda, the Chinese authorities exploit the freedom of expression and the open press we use in America to insert a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"As a contrast – at the aviskiosc on the street here in Beijing, you will not find many different opinions and will not experience real reflections among ordinary Chinese people around China's problematic economic course, given that the media are below the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added: "One of China's largest newspapers rejected the offer to publish" his article, although he did not disclose what newspaper it was.
Republicans scare away female choosers before the intermediate choice with the Kavanaugh fades, warning analysts
Since many top politicians among the Republicans support and defend the highest legal candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has received several charges of sexual abuses, analytics warn that they will receive a reaction, especially from women, in the coming local elections.
The feelings around this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already given signs that they want to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, a professor of State Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s proposal for an FBI investigation in the last second will be enough to calm up angry electors.
"Women will not forget the events of yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national speaker for the progressive MoveOn group last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators sang “November is coming!” while demonstrating in the courses of the Senate when the Republicans who control the judicial committee chose to continue with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the witness statement from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
‘Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to explode’, said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
"The people say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could have been higher, especially among women's uncertain electors in the premises and younger electors between 18 and 29 years, which often do not vote even if they dislike the President."
Even before Ford's public witnessing that gave detailed description of the allegations of sexual violation of the Supreme Candidate, analysts believed that there would be a reaction if the Republicans forced through the appointment.
‘This has become a salvious root of the Republican Party’, said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the RNC (Republican National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It is not only whether the Committee's vote or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh is being set up – it is also the way the Republicans have handled it and how they have handled it’, pointed out Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities United States, a group promoting the choice of democratic candidates, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided over who to believe in the cooling waters of Fords and Kavanaugh's witness explanations, with a little majority for the last.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of the asked persons were fully or completely convinced of Ford's evidence, while 35% said they were completely or quite convinced of Kavanaugh's production.
In addition, 38% said that they were quite or completely convinced that Kavanaugh was lying under his diploma, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After the flake playout, the FBI is studying the claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other charger, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate's Jurisprudence Committee during the ed last week, that Kavanaugh was drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals to her while at a festival during the study period at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, author of World Wide Web, launches a start to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inruption, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where to store their data and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee spooked that the purpose is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said about the start.
‘It is a historic moment’.
The app uses the Solid technology to allow people to create their own "Personal Data Storage Online" or an POD.
It may include contact lists, worklists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.

What is unique with the online personal data store is that the user has to have access to that type of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authorisation through data’.
The idea behind Inruption is according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, that the company shall make available to all with resources, process and relevant competences.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some introduced developers on a contract to work with the project and a bunch of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inruption website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google that they are to introduce something completely new or not, which will make their business models completely calibrated over the night.
‘We do not request their permission’.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inruption's "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that contributes to the protection of the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important vote in the debate on network neutrality.
Although he launches Inruption, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.

Bernard Water: Feiring of Victoria Cross receivers from World War I
The only priest in the English Church who was assigned a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter, was celebrated in his home town after 100 years.
Colonel Lieutenant and priest Bernard Watn were awarded the honorary statement on 29 September 1918 at the battle in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a shield fire days afterwards and was never told that he was awarded the highest British military excellence.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Watn, said it was a "flot symbolic" in the fact that the stone was to be discovered exactly 100 years after the grandfather's price-winning performance.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Lieutenant Watn led his batalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September – “through very thick fog and under strong protection from field cannons and machine guns”.
Later he crashed to the shot line and directed the line "with great courage" forward before he stormed a field canon on his own and struck out three of the departments.
Colonel Lieutenant Watn was killed by a German shield 4 October 1918 – only one month before the war was over.
Michael Vand, 72, said that the grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but something that makes me humble."
He and the brother Dr. James Watn also put down a crane after the parade, which was guided by the Brentwood Imperial corpse.
Michael Watn said, "he felt very honored to play a role in the parade," and added: "The braveness of a real whole is demonstrated by the support that comes from many people".
MMA trailers were up all night to see the Bellator 206, battle sports program instead, they got Peppa pig
Imagine that you've kept awake all night to see the close Bellator 206, just to discover that you can't see the main battle.
The participant from San Jose managed through 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in the United Kingdom at Channel 5.
At 6:00, while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the viewers in the United Kingdom were crippling when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after keeping awake until early morning to see the battle.
A follower described on Twitter the transition to the child program as "a kind of sick joke".
"The State regulation is that it is not appropriate to send such programmes at 6:00 p.m., so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice-president for marketing and communication, when he was asked for the consignment.
"Peppa pig, yes!".
Bellator's Executive Director, Scott Coker, said they're going to work with the mission plan to include the viewers of Storbrtannia in the future.
"I think we can figure it out for the purpose of the fight," said Coker.
"But it's at 6:00 in the morning on Sunday there, and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday of our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the matter.
Trust with-- when we put over, many messages went forward and back, and they weren't exactly of the kind sort.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't that, it was an authority.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We want to reduce from six to five matches – as we usually send – and we tried to stretch ourselves far for the trailers, but the tip over.
It's an accidental situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt lessworthy about sexuality
The Olympic stuper Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of minority toward everyone because of his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't before at the school he realized that "he wasn't like others".
In the first program Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was up to the rights of the gay ones to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent made him less care about winning the OL.
The ordinary program manager of the traditional programme, Kirsty Young, shall be gone a few months due to disease.
Daley appeared as a little away on the Lavers' first consignment and said he felt "less worth" than any other one he grew up with because "it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls".
He said, "To this day, these feelings of being lessworthy and different have been the real motivation and have me the power and strength to succeed."
He would prove that he "was something," he said, so he didn't disappoint all when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He is a two-time bronze winner in the OL and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador. He used his participation in the year's co-electrics in Australia to appeal to the decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he stands forward because he feels lucky that can live open without negative consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The three times world champion said that he was in love with a man - film creator Dustin Lance Black from the United States, which he met in 2013 - "wondered me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him last year, but he said the age difference never had been a problem.
"When you are undergoing so much in such a young age" - he participated in his first OL when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar up and downturns.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "his whole perspective" had been changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything was about I just had to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medal in OL.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after being diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had got tickets to London 2012 – since he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't live long enough to sit on the first row," he said.
"I kept his hands when he stopped breathing, and it was not until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not inevitable," he said.
The following year Daley competed in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life -- to stumble in front of a home public under the OL, the best feeling ever," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Stoud of Heather Small - that meant a lot to him in the drive before the OL and still gives him a goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Form weak Mickelson taken to the golf tournament Clearer Cup Saturday
U.S. Phil Mickelson will hit a record on Sunday when he plays his 47. Clears Cup battle, but he's got to get in shape if it's not going to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial for impressive 12 times, was put on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's four-ball and foursome matches.
Instead of being in the centre of events, which he had so often been for the United States, it shares five times the major winner the day between being a high leader and working with his game in the rank in the hope of fixing what curses.
The 48-year-old never had the best turn, even on the top of the career and is not perfectly in the tight Le Golf National track, where the long raw area still punishes miserable strokes.
And if the path in itself is not scary enough, Mickelson, in the ninth battle on Sunday, the best British Open Master Francesco Molinari, who has joined the new beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their fights this week.
If the Americans, with four points below before the 12 single games, get a successful start, Mickelson's games can prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood what role he had today, gave me a klapp on his back and left his arm around me and said he would be ready next day," said Furyk.
"He has a great self-confidence.
He's a "Hall of Famer" and has added so much to these layers before, and this week.
I probably didn't see that he was going to play two fights.
I saw more for myself, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will hit Nick Faldos record for most played Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It can mark the end of a Cleaner Cup career that has never completely reached up against his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven drawbacks, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, jokeful and likes to drive grain with others. He's a great guy to have in the layer room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun trying against him this week too, and it was fun to see.
He gives much more than just the game."
European Chief Thomas Bjørn knows his great management can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows of experience that a significant management at the entrance to the last day single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an uncomfortable round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 battle at Valderrama, where one side led by the Seven Ballesteros had a five-point leadership over the Americans, but the career for the winner with the least possible margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You still remind yourself that we had a great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far," said Bjørn, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone else in that team that this is not over.
You'll give everything tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus is.
I've always said that I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of what's on the other side -- the best golf players in the world."
Bjørn is very pleased with how his players have done the tough golf course and adds: "I couldn't do it better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, there's the individual performances in the center, and there's something completely different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golf player will be tested to the full.
It's the message you have to communicate to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave the partner, and he also has to go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, the opponent Jim Furyk will try to make his players provide better individually than they did as partners. The exception is Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great revolutions last day. He was in the winner team at Brookline before he ended up as a losser when Europe carried out the “Miracle at Medinah”.
I remember every condemned word of it," he said as an answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the team captain in 1999, had here with his players at the entrance to the last day.
"We have 12 important fights tomorrow, but you want to get a good start, like the one we experienced at Brookline, as we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts a great pressure on the middle fights.
We then arrange our configuration and send the people out in the way we feel. you know, we're trying to create something magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the battle and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top battle, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the upper half of the play order.
"I bet on this group of men in that order because I think it stands all the way," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship delayed again
German Marine's latest fregat would have been completed in 2014 to replace old warships from the days of the cold war, but it will not happen until the early next year because of failure systems and galloperating costs, reported local media.
The completion of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the drivership of the entirely new fregates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been subjected to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military speaker.
The ship should have been delivered the marine in 2014, but the major problems after delivery followed the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered back in 2007 will replace the old fregates of the Bremen class.
It is agreed that they should be equipped with a powerful canon, a number of anti-air shooting and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods – it would be possible to apply the latest fregates for up to two years away from the home port.
However, steady delays mean that the advanced warships – they were said to give Germany strength on the sea – will already be deprecated before they are put in service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 fregate created headlines last year, when German marine officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the yard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for returning, but German media mentioned a number of important 'software and hardware defects' which made the warship unusable in a battle mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important since ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are to be operated by a crew of about 120 seamen - only half of the crew of older fregates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has a huge weight weight, which reduces performance and limits the capabilities of the marine to perform upgrades in the future.
The 7000-tonne heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class as used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost-mark on the entire project — including training of the crew — has also begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a diminishing EUR 3.1 billion – from the original EUR 2.2 billion.
Problems around the new fregates are particularly important in the light of fresh warnings that Germany’s maritime strength is decreasing.
In the past of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the Head of the Defence Committee of the German Government, confirmed that the marine is actually "inempty for applicable ships".
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships were arranged, but there was no new ship.
He regrets that none of the fregates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the marine.
National Trust Hearts on the Secret Life of the Flag Mice
New research carried out by a land property in the Scottish highland shall reveal how flager mice use the landscape in the hunting of food.
There is hope that the findings will put a new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and contribute to the design of future preservation measures.
The study of researchers at National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual flager mice and dwarf flager mice as well as brunlane and water flager mice at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track flager mouse activity through the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using handheld detectors.
Experts' sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the flager mice ropes and the species that do what.
Then a habitat map and a report will be drawn up in order to create a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS natural guardian, hopes that the results will reveal the areas of habitats most important for flager mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will be included in the decision on the measures to be introduced, such as the installation of grassland and the best way to take care of the forest for flager mice and other associated species.
The flagermus population in Scotland and the United Kingdom has fallen considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and planting work that affect jungle sites and the restriction of habitats.
Windmills and lighting may also pose a risk, the same with flue paper and certain chemically treated building materials as well as cave tax attacks.
Flag mice isn't really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes when it comes to catching exchanges.
They use advanced eco-location to find insects and obstacles on the road when they fly.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76 000 hectares of land around the country, takes flager mice very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts regularly conducting studies, monitoring of jungle sites and sometimes rescue work.
The organisation has also established Scotland’s first and only own flager mice reserve at Threave land property in Dumfreees and Galloway, which is home for eight of Scotland’s ten flager mice species.
The property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here on Threave we have a perfect area for flager mice," he says.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there's still a lot we don't know about flager mice, so the work we do here and on other property will help us to understand more about what they need to flourish."
He emphasizes the importance of mapping the flager mice before maintenance on a property since the unconservative destruction of a single bowl area may kill up to 400 females and young people, and may be the eradication of a whole local population.
Flag mice are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, or disturb them or destroy their pants.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee of Bat Conservation Trust, invited the audience to help in the work.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our flager museums, and for many of the species we simply don't know how the populations can handle."
Ronaldo rejects the assault prosecutions while lawyers will prosecute German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the assault prosecutions against themselves as "false news" and says that people want their fame by using his name.
His lawyers will prosecute the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He was accused of paying her $375,000 in the back for keeping close to the event, said Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a direct video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo rejected the charges as "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," says five times wins the Goldball into the camera.
'They want their fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want their fame by typing my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm good," adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldos lawyers are preparing to accuse Der Spiegel because of the claims, which they have called ‘a unacceptable production of suspicions in the private sphere’, according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the football player will require compensation for "reasoning damage to a extent corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of privacy in recent years".
The claimed event must have taken place in June 2009 on a suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga must have returned to the soccer player's room, where he claims to have raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the claimed event and told her that he was "99% a good man" which was failed by the "one percent".
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that it was taken pictures of her injuries in hospitals, but later they made conciliation outside the court because she was "leaved for revenge" and was also concerned about "become publicly dependent".
The 34-year-old she's now trying to make a disagreement because she's still traumatic after the claimed event.
Ronaldo was on the tip to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the claimed violation, and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a contract worth EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom ‘will be sorrowing forever’ for losing car manufacturers
United Kingdom “will mourn forever” if they lose the status as world leader in car production after Brexit,” said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “angry” that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without agreement, they would stop production temporarily at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed crossing at any Brexit without agreement may mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston installation – which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150 000 cars last year, of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the EU.
"Where the United Kingdom leaves the EU at the end of March, I believe we will experience that production at our factory stops," said Marvin Cooke, the Executive Director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without agreement as to how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they're going to close the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is whether what the car manufacturers say is the supply chain risk of any Brexit without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is operated on the basis of ‘Official order’ and it arrives every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and the EU for cars made on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there may be a stay at the border, as the industry says may cause delays and a lack of parts.
Toyota will be impossible to store more than one day of stock at the Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that Theresa May's Brexit plan for further connection with the EU is "president designed to avoid such checks at the border".
"We need to have an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that, as I say, we can not only enjoy success at the moment, but that we take this opportunity," he said at the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The message, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped but warned that increased costs in the long term will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually result in loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union leader at the factory, said that the members are increasingly worried: "My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back".
A spokesperson from the government said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU"
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be exposed again," says the White House.
Donald Trump's Descending Meeting with Vice-President Rod Rosenstein may be ‘exposed another week’ while the battle around the highest legal candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, reported the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises special adviser Robert Mueller, who examines Russian interference in the elections, relations between Trump assistants and Russia, and possible obstacles to judicial exercise by the President.
The question of Trump will dismiss the Vice-President or not, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has been narrow for many months during the speculations in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times wrote that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking up the conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president with the basis of the 25th Constitutional Plugin.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that it was about to withdraw voluntary.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, which was then in the United Nations in New York, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said, "he would only let go" to kick Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoid colliding with Senate's justice committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual violation, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation in one week concerning accusations against Kavanaugh, which further exposed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, participated in Fox News Sunday.
On the question of the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for the meeting was not set; it could be this week, but I realized that it could be a week's postponement because of everything happening with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always busy keeping the press up to date."
Some journalists will argue that statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Programvert Chris Wallace asked about the reason.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to the reluctance of "self-goodness" of television reports, even though she added: "I do not agree with the fact that they are self-good".
Then she suggested that the contact between Trump and the press will be more frequent.
‘The President makes more questionnaires than any former president’, she said and added without proof: ‘We have looked at the figures’;
There will still be press conferences, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States questions directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to get it to often, and you've seen that we've done it often in the past few weeks, and it's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open appointments or press conferences when visiting important persons.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed the possible cause, when he took a solo race and sometimes had a strange behavior in front of a lot of reporters.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland NHS (Governmental Health Service) to express the country’s gratitude and a desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Scottish Member, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to cover the costs of applying for residence and employment permits for EU citizens working in their public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “The United Kingdom and the EU negotiations on proclamation have been held through the summer and are expected to land on a solution to the harvest.
But the British government has also stepped up the preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I realize that this must be a very difficult time for you all.
So I will repeat now how much I appreciate the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and outside, provide valuable experience and competence to strengthen and improve the work of healthcare to the best of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely their home and we hope you will be here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes urgent operation after head damage
The defense player at Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was experiencing the surgery after having received a head damage during Saturday 31-27 losses to Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ reported in Tennessean newspaper.
Tennessee States' main trainer, Rod Reed, told the journalists that the damage happened just before the first round was over.
"He came out on the sidebar and just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they placed him on a bar and brought him back for further investigation.
A tennessee State official told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that ‘not yet available information on the type/size of the damage’ and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transition from Illinois.
He had five takings on Saturday before he ended the battle, which gives a total of 18 takings for his season.
Foreign purchasers will be charged a higher document fee when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign purchasers will be charged a higher document fee when buying property in the United Kingdom.
The change will neutralise the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young choosers
Document tax increase will be levied from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
Experts at the Ministry of Finance expect them to increase up to 120 million pounds per year – to help the homeless
Theresa May will publish today that foreign purchasers will be charged with a higher document fee when they buy property in the United Kingdom – and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be considered as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young people to choose with a commitment to offer more reasonable housing and to provide high-income groups.
The tax increase in documents will be imposed on persons and companies which do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom; the additional money will strengthen the government's actions to remedy the situation of homeless persons.
The surplus – which comes in addition to the applicable document fee, including the higher tariff introduced two years ago on dwelling number two and rental rental purchases – may be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects that the measure will spend up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the newly built property in London is purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which drives up prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get the foot in the living market.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become ‘ghost cities’ because of the many foreign buyers who are mostly outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson presented proposals for a reduction in the document fee to help more young people own their own dwelling.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the housing prices high by buying up land without using it, and required that Theresa May reject allowances for reasonable housing to solve the United Kingdom’s ‘schamous housing policy’.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced an overlooking series of proposed housing reforms, including lease checks and an end to unjustified drafts.
He also wants to give the municipal governments greater power to build new dwellings.
May said, " Last night I said that I would acquire my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream -- that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means to find solutions to our degraded housing market.
United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it may not be so easy for people not living in the United Kingdom, and also for foreign-based companies, to buy housing as it is too hard-working British citizens.
For very many people, the dream of ownership of their own dwelling has become too far away, and the invaluable situation of the homeless persists."
Jack Ross: ‘My final goal is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland manager before or after.
The 42-year-old shot is pleased with the challenge of reliving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and that was it," said Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports sound.
"But I was often with my father and saw Scotland at Hampden as a child, and there's always something that pulls me back.
However, that option would only come if I succeeded in the club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former alloa Athletic boss says he wasn't anxious to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously rejected approximations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League."
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they are undoubtedly members of the Premier League," he said.
It's not a simple task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself having succeeded here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in the management for three years, after a period of assisting boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month short appearance in Hearts' trainer stack.
Then he helped Alloa return from depression to third division and helped St Mirren from the edge of depression to win the master title of the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during the game career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a proper road separation", he recalled when he took over the management of Alloa.
"I really thought that management was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange since I did it well, created me a reasonable income of it and experienced some fine highlights.
But football play can be hard.
There's a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.
I'm going through it in terms of stress and pressure in the job, but the management feels quite right for me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do it, it feels like the most comfortable thing I've known throughout my adult life."

Perfect time for a half-litre is 17.30 on Saturdays, shows study
The summer's heat wave has strengthened the income of the United Kingdom's hard-pressed puber, but put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Puberts and bars experienced a turnover increase of 2,7 % in July – while the income for restaurants fell 4,8 %, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a company consultant CGA, summarised the figures, said: “Continue the sunshine and England’s unexpected long participation in the World Cup made July follow a pattern similar to the previous month of June, when the pubs went up 2,8 %, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1,8 % in the restaurant turnover in June only became worse in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars had the far best result, but an increase that was stronger like-for-like than that restaurants went down.
Puberts with food servering also had problems with the sun, even though it wasn't as dramatic as for the racing drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, the turnover increased by 6,6 % that month, with food servering decreased 3 %’.
Paul Newman, analyzer from the RSM hotel and restaurant industry, said: "These results follow the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sports and social events are still the main factors in placing on the market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still find it difficult, and a turnover of 4,8 % year-on-year will become particularly painful at the top of current cost pressure.
The long, warm summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food servering companies, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will give an extended breathing room."
The total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2,7 % in July, reflecting the braking of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, Sectoral Marketing Controller for Pub, Bar and Restaurants in the UK, collects and analyzes the results of 47 operating groups, with a total turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
One out of five children – some are only 11 years old – has secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers, shows study
A study of 20 000 students in high school revealed pages with ‘fax Insta’.
News has increased the concerns of sexual content sharing.
20% of the students said they have a "main account" which they show the parents.
One of five children – some are only 11 years old – creates social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A study of 20 000 adolescents revealed a rapid growth in "fax Insta" accounts – a reference to picture sharing pages on Instagram.
News has increased concerns about sexual content sharing.
20% of the students said they had an innocent "main account" which they refer to the parents, while having other secret accounts.
A mother who came over the secret ago to her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "violate me".
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC conference for private schools revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to have secret accounts.
HMC boss Mike Buchanan said, "It's frightening that so many youths are tempted to create websites where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be ‘the vote of the lawyers’ in Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics and has a non-exercising role in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated free sports practitioner, and President Ian Beattie described the event as a good opportunity for those who lead the sport to get insight into the extensive experience of her international experience over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world-wide free sports environment, and we are sure that free sporters in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to act as a voice for free sporters, and I hope I have a lot to help guide sports in Scotland."
The American won 200 and 400 meters below the OL in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four OL gold. She's now fast BBC expert, and after she had a transient ice-chemical attack she couldn't go.
She wrote on Twitter, "A month ago today I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that just the time will show if I want to be residual and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm quite good again and I've learned to go again, and today I'm doing smooth exercises!
Thank you for all encouraging messages!’
Breast pump advertising comparing mothers with cows divides the opinion on the web
A breast pump company has split the online opinion with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that are milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first soundless breast pump carried close to the body”, Elvie, the technology-based consumer product company, a fresh and flirting music video inspired ad to show the freedom of the new pump gives active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a cave full of high and cows to a song with, among other things, the following text: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see any tail" and "In case you didn't understand it, this is not juror, it's my puppies."
The choir continues: "Damp it out, pump it out, I feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my balls."
However, the advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, has created a storm on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, many say it paints the "greatnesses" in the maize.
‘Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and feeding to produce milk, but their babies are taken from them a few days after birth," one wrote.
Elvie breast pump is fine in an ammonia bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Of course traumatic for both mother and baby.
But, hey, why not use them to advertise for a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added: ‘For a failure advertisement’.
Others defend the ad.
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would like to have one if I still breast-feed.
The pump made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," it was one that wrote.
Another commented: ‘This is a fun advertisement addressed to mothers such as pumps (usually at work or toilets) and feels like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that shelters or judges the maize.’;
At the end of the video the women reveal that they all danced with the discreet pump in the bh.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women pumping themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses and gets fine place in a breast-bh, so that women get the freedom to move, keep the baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: ‘The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a courageous and provoking launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to put lights on breast pumping and all the challenges, while in an entertainable and recognisable way showing the incredible sense of freedom the new pump gives.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a two-child mother appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a tent camp at the Texas border in secret
The number of migrant children in prison has gone, although the monthly crossing of borders has remained relatively stable, partly because hard retorics and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children in supporters.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants, and have been afraid to destroy their own chances of staying in the country by stepping up and making demands for a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household had to submit fingerprints and that the data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a chief official of the immigration and customs authorities, witnessed to the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people seeking to be supporters of single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested had no previous criminal scrolling sheets.
‘At most 80 % of the persons who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we keep persecuting these people," says Albence.
The officers are trying to manage the children faster and introduce new rules which indicate that some of them must meet in court within one month of arrest and not 60 days of the previous standard, according to recipient workers.
Many will be presented through a video conference instead of personally meeting in order to conduct their case of residence permit for an immigration judge.
Those considered unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in maintenance, the greater the risk that they get anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to recipient workers and reports that have emerged in the past few months.
Advocates said that these concerns have grown at a larger installation such as Tornillo, where children who struggle more easily are overlooked because of the size of the plant.
They added that the movement of children to the tent camp without having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can strengthen traumas that many already face.
Syria asks US, French and Turkish ‘occupational powers’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also acting as Minister of Deputy, said that the foreign forces remained illegal on Syrian soil while covering the fight against terrorism and “will be treated thereafter”.
‘They must withdraw immediately and without condition’, he said to the assembly.
Moualem insisted that ‘the war against terror, to say, is over’ in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011 and more millions have fled.
He said that Damaskus will continue to "führ this sacred battle until we have cleaned all Syrian territories" both for terrorist groups and "all foreign presence".
The United States has about 2000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advice of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-rated country.
With regard to refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he accused ‘ certain western countries’ of ‘spreaking irrational refuge’ that causes refugees to stay away.
"We have addressed the international community and humanitarian organisations to organise these returnes," he said.
They police what is really a humanitarian situation."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defence position of rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to press on for political conversations.
The Russian/Turkish agreement rejected a large scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province where there are three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines” and expressed the hope that military action will be directed to jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaida-associated Nusra Front, which “will be destroyed”.
The United Nations Leading Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to call for the first meetings of a new committee composed of state and oppositional members to draw up a post-war basis for Syria and the path for new elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘the review of the articles of the current Constitution’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win another period
After that logic, Trump would have won re-electives in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are likely hoping for, the law of ranks and scandals will put an end to the presidentship before that time.
In what would undoubtedly be ‘the most dramatic conclusion of a presidentship ever!’
At the moment, there is no sign of secession.
Since 2014, the best shipping time scores have doubled more than 1,05 million in CNN and almost tripled to 1,6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the best shipping time, from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC “The Rachel Maddow Show” has peaked the cable viewers with a total of 3.5 million viewers at evenings with great news.
"This is a fire attracted by people because we don't understand anything," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a recognized comedymaker and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told him to vote on Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh."
It's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, in contrast to everything else on TV, the actions carried out in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Announcement is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you extend far to be an enlightened person when you get sitting for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "dip thickness in the background matter" for the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's leather jacket with straw feather worth $15,000 ("a plagg reflected with hybris," said Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel's colorful descriptions of Trumps, uh ..., anatomy.
At least I don't want to look at Super Mario in the same way.
"Something of what he does to make it look like a reality show, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump show's varying role crew and daily turn on the plot (fighting with NFL, shamrose Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, or you'll be hanging after.
When I met Fleiss this week, there was 27 °C and sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he burged in and looked at MSNBC while he took up CNN.
He couldn't get rid of himself, not when Brett Kavanaugh is to meet the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in the United States.
"I remember when we made all the crazy programs of old and people said this is the end of the Western civilization," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

External money flows into the most regular intermediate options of the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district experiences a flow of money after a conversion of a congress district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting on the same seat.
This newly built suburban district in Pittsburg, with the democratic representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a supplementary election last spring.
Lamb is presenting against another sitting representative, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of the old Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The map was revoked after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were a constitutional manipulation of the electoral circuits in the favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign financing between the largest parties financing groups, DCCC (Demokratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a button winner in a closely followed supplatory election for Pennsylvania's 18th district to the Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given democrats a little management.
United States Assessed penalties against El Salvador for support to China, then pulled the threat
Diplomatics noted that the Dominic Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to revoke the U.S. diplomates from El Salvador, the Dominic Republic and Panama because of ‘the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan’, said Heather Nauert, the minister’s spokesman, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, the penalties were only assessed against El Salvador, which received estimated $ 140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which covered the cutting of economic assistance and targeted indicator restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North-American and Central-American officials exposed a conference at top that focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar collection last year that was assessed as a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the US.
By mid-September, however, officials in the top administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, which stopped all plans for penalties against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now prepared to speak to the conference, which is now planned in the middle of October, to show the importance of the administration adds to the meeting, said the diplomat.
And the three American transmitters returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic calmly without new tough messages or penalties from Washington.
A speaker at the White House for Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analytic who is close to the administration and who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next spike in the box may be special adviser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to legal exercise, which is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is also in the process of extending the investigation to whether Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in interference with our choices.
If the Congress had to change the side, Trump would be charged in that body, in the middle of the preparations to meet the electors again and perhaps at last a jury of his equals.
There are many uncertain factors, and I do not believe to claim that Trump's case is inevitable – and not for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be a choice of us all on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a state coup against Hitler, if only the west had stood up against him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and lost the possibility to avoid the years of blood bathing that followed.
The time of history turns around such turning points, and the unreasonable March of democracy is accelerated or inhibited.
The Americans are faced with several of these turnpoints now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Vice-President Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's review?
Rosenstein has been in hard weather since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed secret hearings of the President and wondered that he was inappropriate to be president.
Rosenstein says The Times' production is incorrect.
"How will we react if the recent FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is approved to the highest court despite credible offense charges and dishonest evidence?
And above all, will we vote under the intermediate election of a Congress that will make Trump responsible?
If we do not compose those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail, because of the experience I got in Praha.
My mother was a Chick-Slovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to ignition the Sabbath lights on the table with the hake cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I avoid viewing our future optimisticly?”

Rangers' Graham Dorran's optimistic prior to the Rapid Vienna meeting
Rangers accepts Rapid Vienna on Thursday, in certainness that over the Austrians after the impressive unconclusive battle in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a strong position to qualify from Group G in the European League.
A knee damage prevented the mid-way player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season in the reconciliation battle 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks Rangers can use the result as a jumping board to get bigger things.
"There was a good point for us since Villarreal is a good layer," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game and thought we could get to something and got one point with us.
Maybe we could've nicked at the end, but unaffirmed was probably a good result.
They were probably better in the first round, and we came out in the second round and were the best team.
On Thursday there will probably be a great evening in Europe.
We're hoping for three points, but it'll be hard because they had a good result in the last match, but with the home public in my back I'm sure we can stand on and get a positive result.
The fourth year was absolutely hard, between all that happened to my damage and the replacements in the club itself, but there is a good feeling now.
The team is good and the boys like themselves; the training is good.
Hopefully we can stand on now, add the previous season behind us and get it to."
Women lose sleep because of the fear of retirement saving
Although the participants in the survey had a clear formation of how they wanted to be handled, few people talked to the family about it.
About half of the people in the National Wide Study said they talked to the spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the children about it.
"People want to be handled by someone in the family, but they do nothing to take that conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Activities.
This is how you get started.
Talk to the spouse and children: You can't prepare the family to give you care if you don't say what you want in good time in advance.
Discussions with the advisor and the family where and how to give the practice; such choices may be of great importance to determine the costs.
Include your economic adviser: The advisor can also help you to find out how to pay for the expenses.
The financing options for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to contribute to covering these expenditure or self-assurance with your own assets – if you have enough money.
Prepare your legal documents: Clear away from legal problems immediately.
Put a health authority in place by appointing a person you trust to have an overview of your medical care, and make sure that healthcare professionals will comply with your wishes if you are prevented from communicating.
You should also consider giving some power over your economy.
You choose a reliable person to make economic decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Don't forget the small details: imagine that your old parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to a hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please enter the details of an overview so that you are prepared.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake – who's the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?

Earthquake and tsunamia in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death figures are expected to rise.
Communication is out of operation, and rescue workers have not been able to obtain information from Donggala rule, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with strength 7,5.
In Palu, more than 16 000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggal on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, which is located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a record that extends along more than 300 km with a coastal line in the north-west part of the island of Sulawesi.
The rule, an administrative region below province level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the beams of the central province of Sulawesi economy, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggal have been affected by tsunamia several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s emergency administration.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also met western Donggla in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is on the Seismic Irration in the Pacific and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamies in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province north on Sumatra December 26, triggered a tsunami hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Sea, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A strong earthquake of 6.8 hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island and triggered a tsunami that struck across the south coast. Nearly 700 were killed.
2009: A strong earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: A strong earthquake hit one of the Mentawai islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres that raged dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A huge earthquake hit the reign of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic while men were reminded of the herbs of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquake hits Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and kills more than 500 people, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and led to the temporary beaching of thousands of tourists.

Indonesian earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people are killed after a earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake with strength 7.5 triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are lower and death rates are expected to increase in the next days.
The earthquake hit the central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
It circulates videos on social media that show the outbreak.
Hundreds of people were gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami thundered across the beach.
Federal prosecution authorities rarely seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York
Federal prosecution authorities in New York are seeking death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terror attack in New York who killed eight people – a rare penalty that has not been penalized in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, used a rental car from Home Depot to accommodate an attack on a bike road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he hit footwalkers and cyclists on his road in October.
In order to justify death penalty, the prosecution authority must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims ‘deliberately’ and caused serious body damage intentionally, according to the notice of intended to seek death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points are qualified for possible death penalty, as provided for in the case document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal major jury 22 point count, including eight aims for murdering in connection with money-pressure, in the face of Saipov, usually used by federal prosecution authorities in matters of organised crime, and a purpose for violence and vehicle rejection.
The attack required “beacious planning and intent”, said the actor, who described the way Saipov carried out it as “hesily, cruel and despaired”.
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal damage, property and loss for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’ states the notification of the plan.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years ago the last time Southern District of New York brought a matter that could give death penalty.
Defendants, Khalid Barnes, were sentenced to have murdered two drug sellers, but were finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after they were sentenced for conspiracy to perform spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple was executed in the electric chair 19 June 1953.
Saipov, from Uzbekistan, showed no indication in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy with what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on the mobile, according to the purpose.
He also asked to hang up the ISIS flag in the hospital room, said the police.
He did not declare guilty after the charge of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were “appointed” of the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to seek death penalty instead of accepting a confession and lifetime in prison without the possibility of release will only extend the traumas of these events to all involved," said Patton.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked the prosecutors not to apply for a death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to ‘mobilise the army of the people’ today during a demonstration during the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said that the politicians should be given the “pushing” of the euro-skeptics – when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbench Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstrators that the United Kingdom would have been "extinguished" now if Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge for May to slightly slightly divided rows has been underlined by the pro-Remain Tories who participated in a own demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Minister of State fights to keep his Brexit plan on the track against attacks from Brexites, Remains and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the back-up – and force euro-scheptics and Labour to choose between her package and "caos".
Bone told the Solihole demonstrants that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and had been responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had had the responsibility, we would have been out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I want to stand on for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit plan".
When he explained his resistance to the EU, he said, "We didn't fight in two world wars to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone argues that the referendum had changed since the 2016 vote: "The opposition that the British people have changed their minds and wish to remain in the EU is completely wrong."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the demonstration and told reporters: "I simply say: Minister of State, listen to the people.
"The Brexit plan is unopular in the public. The opposition is not going to vote for it. It is unopular in the party and with our activists, who are actually those who are crushing the streets and get us selected in the first round.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening.’;
In a direct message to May, she added: "The State Ministers keep the job when they keep their promises."
Farage said that the politicians would be given the “pushing” if they were thinking of betraying the decision taken at the referendum in 2016.
"This is now about trust between us – the people – and that politicians," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know that they won't get away with it."
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to let our politicians, who are on the tip to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilise the people's army in this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham before they had a two-hour political collection in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists vibrated with Tories Against Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis despised the conservatives of the safety problems they had with a party app when the conference started.
"This are the persons who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for a free circulational limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
‘It is a complete hazard.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren considers it serious to be a presidency candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she wants to "evaluate seriously as a president candidate" after the election in November.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats talked about the future during a council meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, re-elects the republikan representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been central in the speculations if she's going to stand against Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electorates, who used the council format since Trump became president.
A participant asked her if she planned to stand as a president candidate.
Warren replied that it's time for "women to come to Washington to fix our defective government, and it includes a woman at the top".
Arrest station after Sims from LSU was killed by shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the shooting episode that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man that was observed on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims got a shot wound in his head and eventually died as a result of it," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he was on the spot and had the weapons with him.
Simpson was arrested without excitement and was held at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Chamber.
Sims was a two meters high youth who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 matches with 10 starts last season. His average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returnes per battle.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton aims into the world champion's title after stallorder gives him the winner of Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stal orders would play a major role in the course.
From the pole Bottas got a good start and celebrate nearest Hamilton of the track while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel ran into the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue running in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes made a pit stop a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some pushing with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver deliberately left the inside free after a double passing to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the field and entered as paragraph seven at the end of the first round of his 21th anniversary.
Then he led in large parts of the race while lying on the wheels to try to get a quick finish and chief Kimi Raikkonen, which was number four.
He finally came into the depot on the 44th round, but he couldn't increase the rate in the remaining eight rounds and the Raikkone took the fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a fantastic job to get a good two-piece," said Hamilton.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump hated senator Dianne Feinstein during a political arrangement on Saturday for her holding that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the highest court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual violation.
When the President spoke during an event in West Virginia, he did not direct refer to Ford's vocabulary before the Senate's Jurisprudence Committee. Instead, he commented that what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "injurious, foolish, and speaking insane".
"The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you experience your mind, when you see people who are mad and bad and foolish and speak false," he said.
"When you look at deliveries and leakages, they say, "Oh, I haven't done it.
I haven't done it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer ... you leaked the document--'Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't leaked.’»
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked ... no, we didn't leak," he added, with a simulation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein was sent to the letter with detailed information about the accusations against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September-- but Feinstein refused that the leakage came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidentially, as she asked for."
But her denial was not graciously taken up by the President, who, during the party event Saturday evening, commented, "I'll say one thing, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defence of the Supreme Candidate, who has been accused of sexual violation by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
‘They have decided to withdraw power with all the necessary means.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get power and control," said the President according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer got two targets for Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants got a two-scale leadership early by shot from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated for the home team before Dwyer restored the management of Giants.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before two goals by Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League tape for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come back after they hit Dundee 2-1 in Belfast Friday night.
It was the third meeting for the season between the teams, and Giants had won the three previous fights.
Dwyer's opening came for the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford opened the game when Beauvillier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan brought his home back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt added up to Cownies' compensation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants had the lead at break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Boochard recompensed again with a masterly goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran went together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the battle late in the second round, and he secured the winner with the team's five-half-way in the final round.
Giants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, plays at home against Milton Keynes in their next fight on Friday.
Flight leaders die to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escape earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is sheltered as after he died and ensured that an aeroplane that had many hundred passengers safely could take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong descendants continue to terrorize the area, and many are caught in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had refugees for life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave their post in the strongly swinging control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway just then, could be safely easy.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would crash.
He died later in a hospital.
Talkman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australias ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we heard it," he added.
The authorities fear that the death figures may come up into thousands and the country's disaster preparation body reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggla, Sigi and Boutong.
‘The numbers are expected to increase further since many equals are still caught under the ruins and many have not been possible to reach’, said the spokesman of the body, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six feet high waves have raid Palu, which will keep a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aeroplanes bring in assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said Sky News: "The whole time you see ambulances that get the dead.
There's a lack of clean water.
The mini markets are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, Chairman of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "Indonesian Red Cross works Febriles to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia's president Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to carry out all the tasks of evacuation.
Are you ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Fly crashed in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after the plane crashed in lagune
The airline that owned the aeroplane that crashed in a lagune in the Pacific of Micronesia now says that one man is missing. They previously reported that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the falling aeroplane.
Air Niugini said in a press message that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they had no overview of.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The air carrier did not immediately respond to the request for more details of the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land on the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officers said on Friday that seven people had been transported to hospitals.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and the state of all was stable.
What led to the crash and the exact sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon right outside the runway.
Some witnesses believed that the plane broke on the runway.
The U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was flying very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to flow through middiedeep water to the emergency exit of the falling plane.
He said the airplanes were paniced and shouted, and he had a smaller head damage.
U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a bridge, also helped in the rescue work by using a blowing boat to transport people in land before the plane dropped about 30 feet below the water surface.
Data from Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG-registered aircraft in the last 20 years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analytics present the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution authorities ended the procedure on Saturday in a new case for a man who was accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Analytics in the Department of Justice, Paul Rowlett, witnessed for several hours as expert witnesses in the field of inquiry analysis.
He described for the jury how he used mobile prints to puzzle together the movements to 29 years old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he collected location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which struggled with what he had claimed earlier, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at the same place as the cell phone of Chambers at the time he claimed to be with the friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness box on Saturday and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked whether Tellis spoke true when he claimed he was in the trailer to Sanford that night, Sanford said he was “lieving because my trailer was in Nashville”.
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile prints suggest that they had only known each other for one week.
Rowlett said some after Chambers' death, deleted Tellis calls, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He deleted her from his life," said Hale.
The defence shall begin on Sunday after the plan.
The judge said he expected that the case would be left to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
Children’s passports in New York prosecutor pairs for dismissal after ‘racist’ message
A childcareman in New York is prosecuting a couple of discriminatory objections after receiving a misinformed message from her mother, who complained that she was "and a black person".
The couple refuses to be racist and compares the target with ‘depressing’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a two-child mother, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new child career, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met up to the first working day in 2016.
‘NEEEEEEII ENDA A SWORT PERSON’, wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to the man, she sent it to Maurice, twice.
After discovering the loss, there was an uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman who left Maurice, claiming that their dismissed child career, who was Afro-American, had done a bad job and that she had expected one from the Philippines, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice claims the couple for compensation for the cancellation and requires compensation in order of 350 dollars per day for the six-month losji-based scheme she was promised, but without contract.
"I wanted to show them that – hi, you just don't," she said to New York Post on Friday, and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple has turned back against the accusations that they are racial and say the rejection of Maurice was the only right thing, because they felt they couldn't trust her after having offended her.
"My wife sent her something she hadn't meant to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," said the man Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you have left your children to someone you had been rude against, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn child?
Come on."
The comparison of the case with ‘expressing’ said Plasco was due to his wife's two months to term and was in a ‘very difficult situation’.
‘Is there such a person you want to punish?
It is not particularly nice”, added the shareholder.
While the legal matter goes on, the public court has been quick to condemn the couple of social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
The author of Paddington feared that the readers wouldn't accept a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to sit in the place of others when they read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says the father, who had worked as a cameraman in BBC before he was inspired to write the child book of a small bear, would have been very happy that his work had been rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book release was "bitter sweet" after he left last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important family member" and adds that her father in secret was very proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he was no shouted person," she said.
"But since Paddington was so real for him, it was almost like when you have a child making a good: you're proud of it even though it really is not your fault.
I think he considered Paddington's success a little bit like that.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone
At landing, the daughter had been hurried to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors were forgiven to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it looked bad, that he didn't think she would survive," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the phone from Nad who said she came to die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, my friend.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medical doctors had given her to make her heart beat, slowly lost his effect and left the system.
She died a while earlier and the organs in her body clapped together.
I just had to sit there and wait, in certainty that it happened.
I couldn't shout and shout because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning over the loss of the daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers – who didn't know about the tests she was through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I looked down all the time and the tears ran into a smooth stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postal cards with mourning women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their dear in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up post cards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and telephone numbers follk can call for help.
Sharon's son Tyler was 13 when he was affected by depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to experience what I have to experience every day," she says.
45-year-old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that the son was a promised cook with an infective smile.
"All knew him on his smile.
They said his smile could light up any room."
He ended his job before he died because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, the 11-year-old brother of Tyler was one of those who found him after he took his life.
Sharon says, "I'm constantly worried that there will be an infection effect."
Sharon made the cards "to tell people that there are people out there that they can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't sit for yourself--you must talk to someone."
Kelly, who has been Sharon's friend for many years, lost Mark, the partner through 15, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't tell him that he felt downward or depressed or something," she says.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed the changed mind.
The first Christmas day he was in the cellar – when the kids opened the Christmas, they did not reach eye contact or anything.’;
She says his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to fight through it: "It breaks up a big hole in the family.
It breaks us.
But we all have to endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while the FBI starts searching
"I thought that if we could get to some of what he asked for – a time-limited and scale-limited examination – we might come to a certain consensus," said Flake on Saturday and stressed that he feared that the committee "folded apart" along fixed batch limits.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The opposition was due to the timing.
Intermediate elections are only five weeks away, November 6 – if the Republicans are likely to do bad, it will be much more difficult for them to get the man they want to choose to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has called around to senators and operated lobby business to make them support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and hit her wife Ashley there when she was personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI has delivered his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where it is currently sitting 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, so Vice President Mike Pence can use his double voice and get him put in the Supreme Court.
The number of Northern Korean offspringer 'faller' under Kim
The number of North Korean hoops to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, an South Korean lawyer exclaimed.
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Collection, said that there had been 1127 jumps last year – compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices in human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't commented publicly.
Most heads from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flights through China, which have the longest border to North Korea and are easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized son between the two Korean states.
China considers the hopes illegal migrants and not refugees and returns them with power.
The relationship between North and South, which is still in war technically, has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for discussions about the unclearing negotiations.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they largely agreed to work for an atomic Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the US penalties for lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will rest on one side first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and says he's inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the highest-right candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temperament that made him unfit to sit in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the opinions in a Saturday interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could only think that if a woman had acted like this, she would have been called hysterical," said Pelosi on her reaction to Kavanaugh's diploma before the Senate's Jurisdiction Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotionally that he had committed sexual violation of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening declaration, sometimes he almost cried and was crying when he talked about the family and the years in high school.
He was also strongly condemned to the Democrats of the Committee and called the claims against him a "great and coordinated character trap" organised by liberals who were mad that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she thought that Kavanaugh's certificate shows that he can't sit in the Supreme Court because it shows that he's predicted against democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi dreaded when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh for the right of law if he was approved and if the Democrats received the majority of the representatives' houses.
"I want to say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to the Congress and the FBI, he's not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he's sitting in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a Judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against Affordable Care Act (Obambamare) or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
In the question Kavanaugh raised questions about whether he would review certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to send a hysterical partial person to the High Court and expect us to applaud it," said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It's a fair anger, months and years when the mind takes over, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We're crying when we're mad," Steinem told me 45 years later.
'I don't think it's so nice, do you?'
She continues: "I got good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere, who said she also crying when she gets mad, but had developed a technique that meant that when she became angry and began crying, she said to the person she talked to, "you think maybe I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad."
And then she just continued.
And I thought that was fantastic."
Tears are allowed as outbreaks of harm partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories from one of my first jobs, was in a man-dominated office. I began to cry with unexplained anger and was grabbed in the neck force of an older woman – a cool boss I had always been a little afraid of – who brought me to a staircase.
"Let them never see you cry," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They will think you're sorry and pleased because they managed to take you."
Patricia Schroeder, at that time a democratic Congress Woman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was a presidency candidate.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to be unfaithful to the spouse on board a boat called Monkey Business and pulled away from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought that there was nothing in the way to examine the possibilities of as a president candidate itself.
“It wasn’t an integral decision”, she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was one more.
Some called it "Snow white and the seven dwarves".
Since it was near the end of the campaign, she left with the funding and sworn that she wouldn't quiet if she didn't get 2 million dollars.
There was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of the support players who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get discount, or?" she wondered.
When she kept the speech to announce that she wouldn't launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – thankfulness to the people who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to drive in money and to reach choosers instead of delegates, and anger over sexism -- that she fell together in crying.
"You'd think I had a nervous crash," says Schroeder about how the press mentioned her.
"You should think that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking maybe what they would write on my grave support?
'She's crying?'
How Trade Wars can benefit Beijing from the United States-China
The opening salves in the trade war between the United States and China were ear-devastating, and even though the battle is far from over, a ripple between countries may be favourable to Peking in the long term, says experts.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by applying customs duties on important Chinese export products, including solar cell panels, steel and aluminium.
The main eskalation occurred this week with new rates of duty on goods worth $200 billion, which means customs duty on half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Beijing has, of course, repurchased every time, now at least with an estimate of five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to match the U.S. attacks, and the world's second largest economy will probably not lift the white flag with the first.
It's too humiliating to the Chinese President, Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can give positive counts for China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependency between the two economies.
"The fact is that a rapid political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could create conditions that start economic ring effects in one of the countries is much more dangerous than the spectators have seen before," said Abigail Grace, a research colleague focusing on Asia at the Centre for New American Security, a thoughtsmia.

With all eight clearer Cup tournaments behind them, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most winning European over the period of 25,5 career scores.
"I'm not used to cry, but today I can't leave.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas picked me out and had faith in me.
I'm very, very happy to get back the cup.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be helpful," said a emotional Garcia after the European winner.
He leaves the stick to his countryman John Ram, who hit the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single games on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud of hitting Tiger Woods – I followed that man closely in the wake," said 23-year-old Rahm.

There were moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
The hatred for Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very good.
We want to regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Cleaner Cup Committee and will look forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud of being their team captain.
You just have to take off your hat.
We were struck."
