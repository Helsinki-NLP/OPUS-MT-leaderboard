A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth by confirming that the election fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by the lightning.
In 10 years, the lawyers of the Republicans have reported only 300 cases of fraud in the United States.
One is sure that these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of elections.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for carrying out the elections in each country.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments have announced new laws since 2009, which harm the procedure for registration or touring.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the elections of November 2010, where 675 new Republican representatives could be registered in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 legislative drafts were introduced only in 2011, which restrict the exercise of election law in 41 countries.
The new electoral laws require the electoral to present a photo and evidence of the US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the voting periods, which declare the right to not register as a voter on the day of the election, and nationals have voted on the right of election for which a judicial act exists.
Before the elections of 2006, no US State has requested the voters to show a photo sign.
Indiana was the first state who raised such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hasted to extend this practice to other countries.
During the last two years, they promoted law drafts in 34 states, with which the electorates are forced to present a photo sign.
It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec, the US citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of the US citizens, i.e. 21 million electoral persons, do not have any photo card issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million newly chosen people in 2012 do not have such a certificate.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often to be paid to obtain the required licence.
The new restrictions affect young people, minorities and low-income people unreasonably strongly.
Indeed, 25% of the Afro Americans, 15% of the people with a income of less than $35,000, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the electorates between 18 and 29 years, do not have the required photo sign.
This is still enough.
The students who are regarded as electors who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo card issued by their institution in several countries.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations to choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state requested a proof of citizenship to be chosen.
Arizona was the first state that introduced such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require the voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting hispanic votes.
Because it is on the hand that two of three hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators in 2011 supported laws in eight state states with which the registration of voters was dismissed on the day of election.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those electorates who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the election registration campaigns in 2004 contributed to registration of approximately 10 million nationals.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of the registration of new choices in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators adopted laws in five other state states aiming at reducing the period for premature voting.
For example, in the general elections in 2008 in Florida 33% of the voters who chose in advance were Afro Americans, although they represent only 13% of the elections in the state.
The same applies to the hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of the electorates, but 24% of the citizens who chose in advance.
In contrast, the whites, which represented 76% of the electorates, represented only 46% of the electorates who preselected.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their followers have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of the voters.
Several draft laws were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The U.S. Advocate General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partly limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 state states have adopted laws which require the display of a photo sign.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right of elections.
The democratic critics highlight the partial political nature of the laws adopted and see in them as a clear objective the impact of the results in the 2012 key countries.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the countries who have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes necessary in the electoral board to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one is sure: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of elections.
In this sense, these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer prior detection: should the test be performed or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows malicious results, with false negative or but also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger delay in the men who are already undetermined to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We received the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there were many interference factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that in a post-observance after 12 years, the probability of producing metastases is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from 50 years of age or 40 when you have a direct relative who was already ill in prostate cancer.
Men of afro-American origin also have a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer disease has been recognized.
There are cancer types that are aggressive and others who are indolent.
The patient needs to be made understandable to the extent of the risk of his cancer disease by showing the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases it is rather decided to monitor the disease actively.
Today, many men who have recognized cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be monitored actively and to provide treatment for progress in the disease.
Increased accuracy, it is certainly the criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who not.
That is why I still recommend the implementation of the test.
The most important is, however, to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not it should be carried out.
In collaboration with the international urology society, Movember has developed a instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous means to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress made in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk to him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer may be prevented if everyone eats well and moves enough.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would increase to at least 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancer is caused by heritage.
Several people also remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco dependency remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It seriously harms the health of people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the speaker André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the cigarette has been abandoned, the risk of cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and adipositas also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast-, grim-, mast-, food-earing, stomach membrane and liver-bearing cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against glamour cancer," he adds.
Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of illness of a Grimm or Mast Darm Cancer.
Wurst products should also be avoided.
The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"Latests can harm the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have examined the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently not clear.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed a rather increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family pre-loading.
"The conduct of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs-Boson Analyzed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs-Boson has stimulated a certain appearance last summer, and this for good reason.
In fact, one believes that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally it is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best or "at least false" declaration of nature and the behaviour of matter - but empirically has not yet been observed.
But for the physics it is not completely sure that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physics congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data to be fully sure about it.
Nevertheless, we assume that it is actually the Higgs, since it seems that there is only a small risk of faking, and let's look at what it is about.
There is an indispensable law in this world that makes two objects unable to exist at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too strong, as you will hurt.
Because even if the particulate physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it also applies to such a law: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "Quantent State", with this "state" in general consists of some of their qualities.
From this, the physics divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner, the good citizens are called Fermione and honestly obey Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons are moving, an evil band of anarchists, whose nothing is sacred - at least not this principle, which means that they can actually be at the same time at the same place.
These bosons are divided into two groups, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which is absolutely amazing): the mesons we will not treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature are spread and with which the Higgs-Boson would be somehow related.
But it has to be stressed here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you could mean.
If you are able to read this history, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particles", which is the "bot" of the electromagnetic force.
For if a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "truncated" at this place, in such a cubic stone that was thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "Trainers of Power".
Stabiler Field
The same applies to the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, has to be "truncated" to show this boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the stimulant must reach very high energy, a little similar to a frozen pond whose surface could only be scared by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particulate acceleration as the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - is required to reach such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Indeed, it is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet of paper would never like it on the refrigerator.
And likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have one mass, while the others (like the photon) do not have a mass.
For what can all these research now be "good," asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science they serve to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physics to examine all the differences between the observations and the SM forecasts.
By the way, there are many physics who hope that such deviations will be found, since the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
The last one has to say that there are still major deficiencies, as it does not explain the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that represents about 80% of the material of the universe (new ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found at the CERN until now.
Effects
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no.
Moreover, in the early 60s, the laser pioneers in the Bell Labors did not suspect that their works would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first long-term laser (the first were polled) in 1962 - has already said that the laser was considered rather a "Labor play" at the beginning.
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in the optic in 1969.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "eye" and has brought him the Nobel Price for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our life, but it means that you can really never know...
Palliativ Care - the best way to die...
With her Committee on Death in Würde, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon, although a draft legislation is being prepared.
However, much remains to do in this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to consider this closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that spoiled him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've done seven years," he said half-heartedly, in his bed in the home for Palliativpflege Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived in the morning.
"It's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The illness makes her work: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
At the table sitting before a delicious lunch, he willingly resign in to let himself help at dinner.
Courageously he can even smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring his medicines to him, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that you should heal my diarrhoea because this is humiliating," he shares.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man is pinking," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the home of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
"That depends on the person's ability," take a step back, he says.
For several people who work in the Palliative Care are considered to take place major events in the midst of these steps.
The patients who are instructed in the home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In this stage, the doctors and nurses who care for them are no longer overwhelmed with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by excavation".
But because of the disease, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she says, before she accepts that one sets up a mask that helps her breathe.
She still expects a last visit to her son from Italy in the next few days.
The home Victor-Gadbois offers a group of volunteers' body care and help for food intake.
The Palliative Care will then be used if there are no other possibilities.
To make the death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11.700 inhabitants have a bed for the Palliative Care.
That's very little if you take into account that we're all going to die one day.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both on the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
One gives the dead man a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi, depending on his wish.
Diabetes no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
Today morning, his son will drink the beer to the feet of the dead.
"We help relatives and patients in the same way," reports Care Director Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other one.
Besides an old man of 93 years old who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his head kisses while admitting to his honor, a young man of 36 years of age who is surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children dies in tragic ways after he has tried everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients in the home Victor-Gadbois are from their residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to a care that should ease the suffering of patients when the latter has reached the final stage of their life, both at home, at hospital or at a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the community for home palliative care in the large Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
Just this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care ensures that several specialist doctors in the Palliative Care are looking forward to the adoption of a law governing death aid and assisted suicide with concern.
Since October, a manifest has been signed by prominent persons of the Palliativpflege, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in order to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health system is not capable enough to ensure that all rights to a high-quality palliative care have before accepting the transition to death aid.
Recently, she says, I've seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency intake without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
At the same time, several uncologens treat their patients, despite the worst forecasts, until the last day.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she discontinued a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologists that I'm going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she regrets that I'm going to stop the fight, she told me.
But she told me I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the career that it has not done this wish after their pain has been reliefed by a team of Palliative Care.
However, it must be clearly stated that the palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
After Elsie Monereau, head of the Palliative Care of the Society of the Home Palliative Care of the Great Montreal, 8% of the patients do not refer to pain treatment.
At the end of life, the doctors thus often react to the terminal seeding, which is about to sleep the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can't act as if we don't observe this side of suffering.
Patients with no pain relief will be increasingly able to react to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that means not necessarily, "I want you to sleep me," but "I want my pain to be reliefed".
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals large scales in Quebec
Officers of the Strasbourg Office, companies of the construction headquarters, money makers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell us every day what they know about a great "system" in which the construction economy, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafioso are crushed.
A "Industry", which was very expensive for the Quebec taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and the 2000s.
"It's strange how the system breaks since you have taken drastic measures," Jacques Duchesseau, member of Quebec and former leader of the Montreal Police.
The scandal was detected by him due to an in-depth examination of the disturbances related to the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which only had consented to the premier minister of then.
The Duchessneau report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and coping of officials.
"Since the study began in 2010," he emphasized, "the Ministry of Transport alone spared a billion dollars to the contracts," because some of them instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to the ground," he adds in the hope that it will succeed in "showing the tactics behind the individuals".
A 2011-born permanent anti-corruption unit
The permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011 also undertakes great efforts with its troops on economic auditors, detections and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau troop" which since 2009 has caused the "canalisation cartell" of Montreal to take place in the artificial explosion of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out orderly house searches and accused of fraud and corruption against municipal mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcote, the mayor of a city.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected that he has repeatedly accepted smuggling money in the exchange of public contracts.
On the other hand, engineers of the Montreal Road Engineering Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly charged.
The latter has stimulated oversight by declaring to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the maintenance of public contracts.
He himself paid for several years 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary in connection with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Throughout the 2000s, Mr Zambito has had his hand in the game by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately EUR 68,000) to province parties, especially to the liberals who were at that time.
He also agreed to have organised an illegal acquisition for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Channelation contracts whose costs were artificially blown up by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and eishockey games, as well as coupling funds of 736,000 dollars as a remuneration for channelization contracts whose costs he artificially blew up.
Other officials of the road construction office have confessed that they have been smuggled by artificially blowing up the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, an organiser of the Citizen's Party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately seeing a shadow budget that filled his cash with black money.
As a result of these disclosures, Mr. Tremblay returned at the beginning of November, which led Montreal to a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal who hit alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she rejected from 2010 against the sale of a municipal property purchased for $5 million and sold for 1.6 million in buildings in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
From the investigation that is finally carried out, she says that it "trails to a thread that enables it to understand the functioning of the system underlying an ants to stop the evil and to trap the guilts".
She says that the procedure is "smartful, but positive".
However, we are in the process of cleaning the wound, we need only a unit of investigation for Montreal, as well as an oversight to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchessneau, on his hand, notes that "Americans stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but mainly think about the role of the "manship carriers who are about the tactics in the picture" if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a proportion of 70% of black money in financing the election campaigns in Quebec, he cheers: "I was told that this is only a weak cluster of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which would not change anything to the situation: "As long as the election expenses are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete review of the public contracting system and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going to the ground with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story hurts the international prestige of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesseau calls on those who laugh about putting a look into their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
During this season, you have adopted a new degree with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my level of game.
And in a game, this is even easier.
The football's going very fast.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the centre of preparing training of the INF Clairefontaine until my playtime at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress progress gradually.
They are therefore using the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses of this summer are used to exhibit games with very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is essential.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer the head and want to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my play position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires all technicians to respect.
In the ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and he is among the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back to a rich experience and has won many tracks with respected associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had just recovered from a injury series.
The confidence he put in me is also an explanation for my performances.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the ligue 1 Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we're in the back.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified ourselves in this way for the eight-final.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak with our words against very good European crews.
First, we want to become the first of our group in front of Porto, so that we can carry out the replay of the eight-finale as a home game.
Can the PSG in the short term become a large European association?
He's already got the budget for...
To become a large European association, Paris must win titles and make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financialally, the PSG provides funds to adopt concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in the ligue 1 as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really our heart to reject this title.
During the last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry out the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We have completed with 79 points.
Usually, you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Although the great teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring the title, I think we have the thing to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much of us is expected.
We accept this perfectly.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something that you can imagine, this is surely frustrating.
You're wondering what the people are expecting.
We could never win with 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
In the Champions League we proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, an association that has not been able to qualify for the eighth-final since two seasons, and who has also made huge expenditure!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to play break with 15 points of advance!
This meant that our opponents and the French mastership would be abandoned.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good during the last season, were "boosted by this new PSG".
This shows that the ligue is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winner and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's so better that you're talking about a "Zlatan dependency".
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and many doors shoot.
That's why he came and he proves that he's the star of the ligue 1.
Wherever he played, he felt that he was a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their level of game.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders worldwide, allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the EM in 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from putting out some time.
I've seen things that I've been strengthened from there.
Today, I succeed in performing good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "blue".
From what happened in Ukraine, we have learned our teachings, and today we have to show a fine behavior.
What opinion do you have about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the Qualification Group for the WM.
The National Trainer is strict, stands close to the players and attracts the victory.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the "blue" to Brazil.
Does the uncertainty made in Spain on 16 October (1:1) represent an optic game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin, payments and sales are possible without bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is to be seen: the conviction that the current currency system created by bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertable in dollars, euros, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchanges such as BitTorrent, which enables the direct exchange of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers in the network.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a payment fund.
After the course of Bitcoin had reached a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later to 2 dollars before he recovered at about 10 dollars today (the courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "like the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" used to get forward in a video game that can be won or purchased by games (and sometimes also exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time keepers of the accounts, auditors, money issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place between two email addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The content of the file also allows to ensure that the traded bitcoins are available in the accounts of public accounts that are widely distributed across the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This happens through a mathematical task that will be started on the computers, with the winner who is a kind of provisional central banker who has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a piece of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file to a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add it a number before the whole is "shacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay the same money twice (less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without link, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
To prevent an inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be divided up to a hundred millionth, which leaves a certain gaming space...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the calculation performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked and the bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The used weakness point does not affect the actual protocol," insurs Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also reveals this deficiencies.
Important players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others like the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel have analyzed the accounting book and shown that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega lock sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a book on this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are thus cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by the dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify one address that can be "fotografed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend where hierarchical systems are considered more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take a while until bitcoin goes through, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
Furthermore, in its report, the ECB proposes to re-evaluate the different risks considered to be high today in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The NATO and the United States are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to recover the possession of its territory and the Afghan population to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
We have in particular punished the Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have been refugeeed to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse a armed foreign presence, such as in the days of the Soviet Union.
They want to defend their centuries and archaic traditions, even if they have joined Djihadists, Pakistanians, Arabs, Uzbek and Tajikes.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local opsists, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discrete.
The deduction of the French troops from the foundation in Nirab, which I have seen by a hill planted with mantle trees, financed by French loans, took place properly.
The helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will be no more inflows of the Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their inconsistent premarch from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overturned from war due to the struggles of the various oppressive groups.
Their takeover was then considered a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for obskurantism of farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved until today.
The former Mudschahedin, the Afghan Government and the present Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main personalities of the anti-Sowjetic war have returned to power in 2001.
They have transformed into businessmakers by capturing the government's land to sell them as a farmland to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from the massive American award of subcontracts.
They have brought themselves in prosecution, and most of them were not involved in the struggles themselves.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that does not compose from thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who could make use of the American applications: capital refuge is considerable.
The young people sat the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have enjoyed their advantages.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the first parties or to corruption of certain leaders, will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is seen everywhere.
There's a army now.
Will the authorities under which they will be commanded be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Sovjetic battle are already trying to restore the militia in the province, which will withdraw the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identity should have benefited from a certain decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister since the Constitution of 1964, the US wanted to make a centralised state with a strong presidential force.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the event of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industry has not been rebuilt, functional dusts are not present and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country based on 30 years of war, State control of infrastructures would have been required.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan possesses huge soil treasures.
This further strengthens the impression that the western countries were only on the spot to authorise it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper on the site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, leave international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the huge Buddhist site to make their excavations and remain the main employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French battle forces was completed on November 20th.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuing of traditional assistance: girls and younggymnasia, Institute of French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of civil-military actions by the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was suspended in 2012, has carried out in thousands of mountain villages numerous non-profit work and measures for the renewal of agriculture and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in order to try to win the "hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of compatibility of aid and open action.
These works, for which many local workers were required, have helped to suppress the rebellion: irrigation, fountains, drinking water, reforcing, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural land use.
What souvenir are we leaving after two billion euro military expenditure?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these often at a height of more than 2000 metres.
The message received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities of the Province of Capisa.
In order to liberate farmers from the rebellion led by foreign groups, which is their wish according to their own statements, it would be necessary to continue smaller, well-controlled and directly related civil aid for their benefit.
A Constitution with the Brechstange in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise all, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly will adopt its final version on the next day.
Just one week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of its work.
Egypt has now been based for almost two years on a preliminary, multiplely modified text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal interference.
This new initiative has only provided for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "the right to go with feet".
On the side of his advocates, it is a way to stop the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerate the transitional process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to refrain from their efforts to explain the text section for section to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to recognise its public and democratic legitimacy while the protest is dead throughout the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American Weekshow Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote well-willingly.
In particular, with this withdrawal to an overhauled vote, the Egyptian people will have an ultraimum: "You either vote for my draft or I reserve the unlimited power," the latter should consider to end after the constitution has been adopted.
85 largely Islamist members of this Constitutional Assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals have not met the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, they reversed because they believe that they have not been able to apply their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
In order to achieve the decision-making capacity yesterday morning, 11 persons, vice-presidents, were added.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were usually adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it entertaining, by the way, that the only difference in opinion of the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, since some of the members of the Board believed that the Pendelure of the Constitutional Assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was still adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which was all focused on itself, remains the same as that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Shariah are the main source of law".
The salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a more stringent application possible.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a proof of their good will and of their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Shealth" replies to the liberals who view this as a propaganda struggle.
For they say that the constitution is Islamized on other articles.
In particular, they have regarded Article 220 in view of the advisory function of the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the people who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are also encouraged by the fact that the next director of this university is much less moderate than the current.
"There is no specific religious commitment at this time.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the citizens' state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained partly in the French system," Alexis Blueet complains, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, that in relation to Article 220 there may be a multiplicity, since the terms used have been rejected from the religious vocabulary.
In particular, it refers to the "Fiqh" [Islamic law, note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide about it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticised by the extensive powers he grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the request of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national Defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations demanded to defend human rights.
The latter also share their fears regarding the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The survival of blasphemy will be maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to free expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
In their view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to express himself on TV yesterday evening, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The prosecutors of the Supreme Court will march out on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the navel of the world and a sea of sun
The praised country unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort, and unrated nature.
AIF calls you the five main reasons for a visit to Israel.
Beneath the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It says that everyone who bathed in this river receives God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place in which Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine on a wedding celebration, the walking on the water, the silence of the seastorm and the fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the saints, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Believers go here the path of suffering or crossway of Jesus Christ (in Latin Via Dolorosa).
The road begins at the Roman Festival of Antonia, the pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the grave church on the Mount Golgotha, where the cruise site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus is located.
According to Christian opinion, the navel of the world is here, symbolizing the rescue of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands in the place where a Christian legend was grown by the tree from which the cross was made for the crossing of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the clergymen, the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of various religions leave records with wishes that then come into fulfillment.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the Massada Festival form the remains of the secret hide from enemies that made Herod the Great build for his family in 25 C.E.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains in 450 metres above sea level.
Only mountain climbs can reach the ruins with their own power.
All others bring an air seil path to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters, the famous ski area of Hermon is located in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The Skipists have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, supposedly pagan gods lived on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
During only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting ones should be visited.
There is once the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parlament).
There, old quamran manuscripts or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in rock holes in the Jewish desert, are stored, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exposures.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is issued.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which hosts several pillars of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures from then visitors and bath servants.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum leaders or souvenir shops.
The entry is free and donations are basically rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells us about one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most absorbing department is the monument for the children that was built to remember the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When you enter the room, there is full darkness.
Stars kick.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are evident.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for Health
The three main restraints of Israel are on the rivers of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, delfinarias and oceans.
Amazingly, in the Red Sea, the water temperature is not below 21 °C and the air is warmed up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathing throughout the year.
In addition, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
His turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus wears even non-swemmers easy on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is infinitely beautiful.
Visitors are here for treatments using salt water (natural saltsole) and salt slam, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergy, asthma, eczems, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease, and for calming strapsed nerves.
touch the secrets of ancient times
These secrets are the old town of Tel Aviv, namely Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous seaway, Egypt, Syria, Anatolians and Mesopotamia was connected.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah just built his ark here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists are happy to swallow through the narrow gases named after star signs.
Fortuna shall be the legend after all the holds that touch the walls in the street with their star sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newly arrived pairs from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strike through the Roman theatre and conquere the fortress of the cruisers.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilatus.
In the carefully restored theatre, concerts and operas are listed today.
List of tourists
If you drive to Israel, don't worry about your bad English skills: about 30% of the Israelites speak Russian.
The money in the journey is to be taken into no euros, but to dollars that can simply be switched to shekel (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekel).
In the city you will mostly come forward with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a fast roadway and in Haifa the only subway line of the country with six stations that connect the suburban to the upper city.
Exactly, it's a underground steering trail.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, which is enough for a journey up to 1.5 hours inclusive.
According to Jewish tradition, Israel is held on Saturday of the Sabbath.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and businesses are closed, and public transport is resting.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only cotton food is served, which excludes pigmeat, marine products, fish without sheep and food, which contain both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different courts with hammle and beef, soup and deserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish Humus palace, various socks, fried balls of pureed beans and herbs (falafel) as well as fruit and vegetables.
There are no thrilling dogs in the streets of Israel.
For this, there are many well-fed cats who swept cozy and unhealthy through the streets.
In the evening, you can even see them sleeping on the roof parking cars.
The cats like live places and don't say no to deliciouss.
A car rental costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs more than $15 a day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Entertainment cards for museums cost in average 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, over three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventures and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists arrived in the praised country, corresponding to a 51% increase in 2010 compared to the comparative period, before abolition of the visa obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While Members and citizens' lawyers discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals already act with false certificates
Annually 13 million guests come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families staying in the home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force which, according to each work migrant, must carry out a test certifying the knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing economy and in retail trade.
However, the tests, according to the Federal Migration Authority, are to be required for all guest workers in the future.
Not only language tests, but also tests must be placed in the Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the maintenance and extension of the permission to work.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian official language is.
Similarly, those who received their training certificates and diplomas before the destruction of the USSR in 1991 are excluded from this law.
Consciousness, problematic and protection of rights
The whole of the auditing bodies will be held under the ambition of the Puschkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the Sankt Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can carry out the tests in all cities; more than 160 corresponding centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to initiate the tests was supported by the members of the Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens' laws asked several times: What does it actually bring?
What changes do the requirement to present language skills bring both for the Russians and the host workers?
Above all, speakers of the Migration Authority respond to reducing the number of forced workers.
"Many people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrants," says the leader of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must already be protected from their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers at 90%.
migrants without occupation, education, language skills and medical assessment are at stake.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will necessarily meet people with evil intentions, which will put him under the predecession of help into a dark, narrow barack, where he will endure with dozens of his similar months without food and documents and will create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home, the One is promised to you, and at arrival you will be betrayed, their passports will be taken away and will not receive the promised wage," confirms the Head of Management for Work Migration of the Tadish Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't shrink, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they can hardly express themselves in writing, not only the language of the target country.
Of course, this is not as much their fault as rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Ubek and Tajike can only provide a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, but to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school matters.
As a teenager, these children then immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens stress the following important aspects regarding the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to put the test down.
If you do not have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
At the same time, most of the guest workers continue to remain illegal in Russia.
"Well Welcome" or "Unauthorised Accession"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic barriers and, of course, the language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and then there are cases of depression.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," says the Tajike Umed Huschkadamow to journalists.
"Don't scourge any costs for false papers"
Already on the day on which the law entered into force, it appeared that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be faked.
Some false certificates, which certificate the graduation of the language test, have already been captured by officials of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with a common colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive this for no reason: every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a work migrant three thousand rubels.
The most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be easily purchased, both officials and citizens' lawyers agree.
At the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they receive time for a language basic course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where no active understanding with humans is necessary.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal arms market
The proportion of legal weapons in criminal offences is very low
The Russian Ministry of Interior plans to strengthen the arms law for private arms owners.
So the authorities respond to the recent events: injured in shooting on weddings and seven dead at the arrival of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to prohibit the wearing of non-mortal weapons in the public and raise the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has supported and promised the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption Control, Irina Jarowaja, that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted in the short term of the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attracting the screws".
In the Internet, an open letter was published, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - ask the authorities to take a distance from "sinless sharpness".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal, Wasily Lesnikow, the Russian service of BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes were committed with the use of registered weapons during the six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand defects were reported for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a sharpening of the law for private arms owners of criminals will not stop using on the black market.
At present, the authors say that in Moscow you can find any possible weapon for little money.
At the same time, the Ministry of Interior emphasizes that the dissemination of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons come across several channels to the black market.
There are five such main channels, tells a former colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are being stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these are weapons stolen from both the police arms chambers and directly by the criminal persecution officers.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arms.
In many military camps, explosions were frequently observed.
"There are evidence that in some cases it was fire-building to mix the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, a contribution to the black market also makes the arms manufacturers.
"Today there are countless private armor factories that do not stand international competition and therefore swallow the weapons under hand on the black market, such as in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries like Kirgizistan.
"There is a own, sometimes crafty production as well as a mafia that organizes smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where are the weapons coming from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was written by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the subject of weapons.
The largest part of the illegal weapons comes from the army and the judicial authorities, according to the investigators.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there through the school of officers who have come to deal with weapons in their work, says the report.
According to researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict areas, 14% fall to thefts in arms production, and 5% came from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor to a weapon shop, which is not intended to be called namely, assured that weapons found in illegal excavations have long been buying no more as they are outdated.
According to him, it is more frequently that dealers get the replacement in a weapon camp.
A gun, for example a gun of type TT, is bought over a feather.
The gun is issued and handed over by the tooth.
"The dealer brings the gun into the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police, of course, know about everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan for the detection of crime, regular control purchases by dealers offering illegal weapons," the sales adviser adds.
"As in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers are most frequently found about acquaintances.
I had looked at web pages and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested to come to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me to have a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I learned only there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales adviser. "I have such a gun, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers on the markets, but there you have to go and use a code like "from Ivan Ivanowitsch, which makes it possible for the daughter to lose a tooth."
I'm even coming to some beatings at the moment about a familiar person I trust.
He also delivers me the beatings because he knows I'm not crippling him.
New ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
The schemes have not changed him.
He got a photo album in which "all the possible" was pictured.
"I felt like in the luxury store," the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything out.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, but riding with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," says in the advertisement on the website "Kopen Campspistole or Gun".
There users give up your orders and make requests.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", user asks "Iwan" (both quote).
"Kopen a TT. Moscow," is the Lacony question by "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service has recently switched countless web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the service to the network.
People come as hungry fish in feeding and then land in Siberia and may swallow coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following schedule: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The officers shall accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a banking machine.
"As an answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that if you place a request on a website, you can also go out empty and get behind grids.
The Federal Security Service has recently switched countless web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go to the service to the network.
"The people come as hungry fish in feeding and then land in the Siberian Labour Camp and allow for coal," he says.
A Macarov for 100 US dollars
When buying illegal firearms, experts have to expect prices from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of type Makarov for $100 to $300.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is released in military arms camps by overseers in the middle range.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Interior, the number of offences with illegal weapons in all Russia in the period January to October 2011 decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of explored cases of steal and depression related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket employees struggle in the United States
Every fourth American youth sits behind the box of Mc Donald's
In recent days massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chickens have been found throughout the USA.
No one can yet foretell whether the protest will continue to swell or whether they will soon get out of the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several links-oriented non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food employees, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly socially organised.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to hand joints.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and devoted together with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group is low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from windels over hunting guns and autobatterias to dust cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is in average between 8 and 27% more favourable than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low-paid Walmart employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often only sell the product so cheaply because the employees are paid badly.
Latest complains also about heavy working conditions, such as missing fork bars or handscanners.
The participants of the protest at the "Black Friday" demanded wages increases and expressed their trouble that the contribution to the operating health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns 9.5 dollars the hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increases the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than they donate for wages now.
If Walmart completely put the salary increases on customers, every purchase cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
Every year, this would be for them compared to today, more spending of only $12.39.
Advocates of Walmart are pleased to note that there were only protests in nine states and that they did not cause any losses to the company.
The Black Friday took the next day in his store from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart boxes carried out almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
The company's speaker, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-right Huffington Post, that "less than five" Walmart employees had set up the work and the protest action was only "a further PR-trick" of the trade union that organised the protest.
"Free cabinet!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart (which were not desired in this advanced city and therefore inexisting so far), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given a hospital days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
At present, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is at $7.25 per hour.
In fast food restorants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too strong, and averagely their simple employees in New York receive 8.90 US dollars per hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it's possible to get out of New York with as little money, I'm incredible.
There was once a time when almost a quarter of all American youths were behind the theke after school at McDonald's, but the youths still lived with their parents.
Nearly one saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, people who complain that they have to get out of this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to get children if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests that started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and cookers of fast food restorants receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which is more than a double of the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US-American law prohibits the management of the company to stand away from this goal and to reject or dismiss trade unions members.
On the other hand, business management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high level of staff fluctuation.
Inadequate
There were sound protests this day also before many other fast food restorants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protest was a meeting in the afternoon before McDonald's at Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including town council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not given a hospital days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrations were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor Candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support fast-food employees so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action in the history of the US fast-food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on the site, of which by far not all are busy in the fast-food industry, working in New York tens of thousands.
It is not yet possible to check whether the radio of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain is only moderately overlistable to date"
The popular theme of enlarged reality, which is popular in adherent to modern technologies, has recently been observed for normally through the lens of a special glass.
First, in summer, Google presented a working model at his annual conference, and in November it was known that Microsoft had also registered a corresponding patent.
However, in conversation with the Head of the Group for Interactive 3D Technology at the Microsoft Labor in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company were only a transit station.
It irritates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with mere hands and creating virtual surfaces.
- Please describe a brief description of what research your group is doing.
- We are dealing with the interaction of humans and machines, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, mankind has been stuck mostly in the phase where pixels are worked on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to foresee 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox consoles and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and today the Xbox will no longer be sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We try to change this, working on real three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more fascinating.
However, it is necessary that not only the user, but also its environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these devastated virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about speech control?
She's popular, but isn't she overestimated?
- It is certainly not the whole purpose solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform all aroundstanding people about his actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but every one in its particular nest.
For example, we worked in the field of controlling objects on public places at a project where we experimented with short and button, instead of with exciting gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretical could be reduced to the size of a bracelet clock.
However, the future belongs to mixed types of control, such as geography and language.
- How?
- We'd ask you to give you this spray?
They say it and indicate it at the same time.
- Usually, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Do you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at the time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time, we will have to work mainly on the development of new sensor types, which will enable us to get more precise in mind reactions from people.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good solution in depth, which is very important.
- What requirements do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Does it lack dissolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is essentially a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Thus, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only be taken into account the resolution along the X and Y but also along the Z axis.
The speed and the number of images per second are also important.
The movements of human beings are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are too little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor with a regulated processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work, I needed exactly such an device, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second one receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a common RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Beautiful would be a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera necessities to find out how this helps us to identify a position in three dimensions.
- If I remember right, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public, in contrast to Google.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of expanded reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone in the raised hand on the road, but I think the most great variant would be a "changing" extended reality where we could switch over a cloud from the glass to the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and there is their strength (Privates can only be seen), but at the same time also their weakness, because an extended reality through glasses prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- For a moment, we imagine that the manipulation of virtual holog frames in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that often points to the critic of this idea: there is no sensitive reaction!
Hands don't feel anything at all!
What answers do your group want to give to this impression?
- In my lectures, I often say that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in interaction between human and machine.
I think that the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of the tactical perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an unusual projection document.
She takes a great deal of pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually aimed at granting the "images in the air" something hand-fast, for example, the interference of some targeted ultrasound rays at a particular point where the finger is located creates a feeling that is at present still so weak as if someone breathed over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve ends in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to override the brain?
It makes it feel what it should feel when it sees something right now?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
There is another task that we will have to fight with for a long time, namely to allow a person physically located in a closed space to believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with running bands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms as well as large balls.
So far, the brain can only be overlisted moderately, and there are many working years in front of us.
This makes work in the area of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", which is dedicated to city residents who form the Avantgarde of art and culture.
On the read list, already high-level representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and often find recognition in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the butterfly dressed in red, one who is at the Russian museum, once at the summer garden, at the scene meetings or at the vernissay.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract great masses.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 1980s or early 90s.
He is also a man of the city, and by his presence on the street, he is a smile in the face of his fellow citizens and makes them a good laugh.
He recently grabbed a spin organ and became a Petersburg spinorel player, since he finally felt ready for this difficult role in his artistship, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or Turkish in the city?
I chose the color of red as a fashion designer that confronts the optic and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image advisers and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the greyworm calls out aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to talk with people through my provocations.
Each of my last provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Newski Culture Palace, where my work was posted.
I understand I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognised painters ended at that time, and new and free painters like me were inconscious.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from it was "Pushkinskaja 10", and then only ended.
I draw it to the theatre, to the fashion, to music, actually to everything, except literature.
It was important for me to be at the centre of Petersburg's culture where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a musical-artificial club for the Bohemia, the house of Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how snur with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Snur and his friends sang simple songs to the playback, weared close tricots and also belonged to the composer Igor Wdowin today.
When the group started playing live, her "Leningrad" became out of her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Gali".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but the foundations he learned from us.
The galleries "D 137" or the "Gribodov" club also originate in the Art Clinic.
Our employees and tribal guests went there.
I am a hero of the past century when culture meant something.
In 2000, there was an investigation in the press, which was about the award "Performances of our city".
I won in the category "Artist of the Year", and so I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In today's time it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unrecognizable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the currentity and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clouds".
Clowns are timeless.
Previously, I was social, but now it pains and scares to be like that.
In a clown, it all blurs and loses his tragedy.
I love the Greatske, and I have bigske ideas.
For example, let us save the world by insisting that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is oriented at the outermost and not on the inside of the human being.
But maybe you can't give a man the hand, but you should spit it in your face.
The deception disappears by dressing.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the city's spinal organ player.
Who, if I don't?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the destruction of cultures.
In the past, the people formed large groups: the Bohemias loved the One and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you'll like.
Now every cult star has about 100 trailers.
- Stas Michailow's appearances, but several thousand!
- To him, abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people are coming and not 10 thousand, so there are fewer management, money, and everything is lost.
I have trailers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not destroy the enriched.
In my youth, I painted such pictures that were even hanging with the works of Falk and Larionow with a collector.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It says: spiritual culture and consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I advocate.
Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
One says, servant of culture.
But not everyone of them can deal with culture.
In the real Zars it was different, because the Zars may not understand much of culture, but they understood that the right experts were necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have which experts could be, but they will be blocked because more high-grade experts need to evaluate the first and make them free.
Now only the own taste is counting.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say they do not accept all contemporary arts and therefore some painters need to look for other museums.
What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding nutrient floor.
On our stones, art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural nutrition floor, for example, we have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less with us.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is financed from grants from the city of Sankt Petersburg
Birth in the universe
Earth in danger.
Heating or collision with chill-rasteroid.
Caravans from space ships with earth's inhabitants on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to rescue mankind, is the important question about how we can reproduce ourselves in the weakness or in the replacement planet?
In my opinion, there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least be inhabited hypothetically.
"Reasonably Mars and Venus," says the scientific employee of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of the Venus.
Life would only be possible in a large height or in the circuit of the Venus, that is, in all.
The question of reproduction in all the researchers first discussed with regard to the Flora.
Experiments with plants have already been carried out half a century ago.
The fourth generation of heritage cultivated in the orbit did not differ in the least from the earthly species.
It followed the cultivation of insects, more precisely of small fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, watchmakers were sent to the world space to explore the effects of severity on the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chicken.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chicken must find a stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the laboratory leader of the Institute for Medical-biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid underground, the chicks overwhelmed wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns were completely stumbled.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later they just died.
"Twice we let chicks swallow and then put the whole thing in place because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychew holds the failed experiment with the chicks in all.
The last breeding cake with animals fled in the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments are continued in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only similar species.
There was an experiment with rats that have already been sent fruited into all.
In principle, nothing special was identified.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and research needs to be continued," Wladimir Sychew notes.
After landing, the space rats were grown up.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are screwed out of their natural habitats can simply not follow their reproduction drive.
Unlike animals, man could be principally.
The homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying to all for 50 years.
There was the greatest risk in Tereschkowa.
The most valuable thing mankind has is female organism.
Our muffins fled from it, and no one on earth could have answered the question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to life after this flight?
"No one finally answered this question," says the vacation veteran Watch Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonautin, Valentina Tereschkowa, born a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in the All, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was two times in the orbit and even worked outside the spacecraft, was born a son.
Yet, a risk remains.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy adults.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into the orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratorium at the preparing centre of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
The cosmonauts win routine for work in the open space here in a sweeping state.
The water represents the weakness of gravity.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is a strange environment; yet infants feel water as a natural element.
It's like the small ITYander's testimony of the country's departure of life on the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that a child is located in the mother’s stomach in the fruit water about 9 months and that it can then be easier to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to first swimming just goes two weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
Thus, while the weakness of gravity for a newborn child is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of severity, the abdominal and basin muscles are very rapidly decreasing in the ability to push the child out.
All right, let's overcome this by birth-introducing aid.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to press the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the non-significant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the erection, the organism cannot train the skeletal and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in the orbit like a adult for training in a load dress.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment that we do together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bringing a disabled, a perfectly inappropriate person to life," predicts the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the world room is only theory.
But at some time it will be real when the earth's inhabitants in their spaceships break up to a remote planet, which will be the home for their descendants in all.
NKU-Chef: Control of the Black System fails by political debts
The Czech Republic has good controls and adequate laws in connection with public procurement, but does not apply them.
In the discussion for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Novyšší controlní úřad, NKU), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I think this is not the case with us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result also appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practice example, he leads the position of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then cannot simply come to the Chairman of Government, and the control body whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law, in his activity," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Committee of Inspection of the Chamber of Members, you spoke of a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries relating to public contracts were compared.
What was that about?
It is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
Simplifiedly, it is about the European legislation to determine how public contracts are to be handled and the national legislation is based on this, and the actual practical application is still available.
We have compared all this with each other, and although the examination is not yet completed, we have been able to find very interesting differences. In general, the laws in us may even be a bit "strunner and more perfect", which is actually applied in Germany, however, in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules again and again. It is also necessary to consider the actual application of the law.
How can the project be helpful for you?
Such common control could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and to reduce and eliminate thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economicity means to acquire a matter at a reasonable price (not always the lowest price) and to exclude illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
However, the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even so that in this way we load the system only with excessive "payer crush" and those who are looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems of practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKU, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German Pendant is the NKU of the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to that of us and also has a college, which is just something different, but essentially both authorities work similarly.
The competencies are also to a certain extent comparable, but Germany is a state, i.e. that these accounts are also available in the individual countries - therein the German system is different from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds, which correspond to our government funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and communities are subject to the control of the national accounting courts.
What the German legislation concerns is it easier than ours?
In general, I would not compare this without specific information, but, in some respects, Germany is often described as an example, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Maybe that's because there's a better checker there?
That is certainly not, but, as I said, I don't like such comparisons.
To this end, it should be noted that the countries that are an example for us also have problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything of cooperation with our authority, would they?
As far as the Czech legislation is concerned, what importance did your authority have to novellify the granting law, do you already feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this novell is in force for a short time, it does not yet affect our tests.
Since our checks are carried out afterwards, you have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we have more impacts in the preparation phase of future controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Detection of risks of ineconomicity" and have been reviewed and analyzed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will naturally affect, as the thresholds, the conditions for certain kinds of tenders have been modified, including.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will confirm.
However, the problem may arise that the rules are "structible" and that they can no longer be complied with.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to the examination of the body (e.g., in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are responsible for the fact that any non-compliance with the budgetary discipline infringement law is equal.
But is it useful to make the law even more stringent?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not to punish those who have committed a mistake of shape that do not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system is merely under the pressure of bureaucracy.
Where's the way out here?
First, let's say what path is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not lighten the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the President of the Government can not simply come and the control body whose duty is now controlling compliance with the law can be hindered in its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the matter," but he cannot say that we do as if nothing were.
The award law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the tenderer is excluded with the best offer only due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I believe is missing.
On the streets there are a number of ice glätts, but mostly they are dry.
On the streets of Czech Republic, there are partly snow and ice slides.
However, the roads are generally well transportable, sometimes increased caution is required.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well transportable this morning, several snow and ice slides.
The temperatures decreased to -5 to -10 °C, it is supposed to be a little warmer every day.
In the region it no longer cuts, and in the deeper heights only a thin snow cover remains.
However, on the cages of the archipelago is about 30 cm snow.
According to the district road guard, the view of fog was limited.
The R6 highway and the roadways of the first road class in the region are currently unlimited.
However, attention is required, for example, to bridges on which the routes are sometimes required and smooth.
Similarly, all roadways of the second and third class of roads, including mountain roads, are transportable.
However, on these roads there remain a cut-off of required or expelled snow residues.
In particular in the higher layers, there is therefore increased attention.
Bezirke Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads Eastern Böhmens there is a danger for ice leather, in higher layers and in the mountains, some of the roads are still out of the snow layer, informing the road and motorway directories on their websites.
The street championships warn drivers against ice slides, which can occur especially in higher layers in the Pardubice district.
In particular, it can be found on roads of the second and third road class in the circles Lanškroon, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly located on the streets in the giant mountains and in the mountains of Orlické hory.
A driven snow layer is located on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohren, it is mostly sunny or hot today, and it remains largely defeat free.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it swells a weak wind.
Arrows District
The roads in the Pilsen district are well transportable today, but local attention is given, and the routes should be adapted to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it has cut before and the temperatures then fell, it can come to ice glates on the streets.
Locally, it is also expected to be fog, but the view will improve during the day.
This information is derived from the district road championships.
The D5 motorway is practically unlimited, however, increasing attention recommends the road championships between the 80th and the 131th kilometre.
The routes of the first class of roads are mainly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the circles Pilsen and Tachov, however, it can be cutting into ice slides.
The bicycles of the second and third class of roads are moisture and therefore also the reference to possible required sections is also applicable here.
Chief drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in the field of Bohemian Forest.
Olomouc District
With snowmatch today, drivers who are on their way to the heights in the district of Olomouc are going.
After the use of scattered vehicles, snowmatch remains on the passport Červenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nightly snow drive forced the street championships to use, in the circle Šumpere fell about 3 cm new snow according to road management information.
In the rest of the district, the routes are mostly unlimited.
"In the circle Šumpere remains in the heights still snowrests.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to expect snowmatch towards Jesseník," said a road management staff Šumpern today to the Agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in the district of Jesseník also had to go out in the night, according to their information, the roads are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc circle, the roads are unlimited, but in the Šternberk circle, the drivers must drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still moist.
District of Ustí nad Labem, Liberec District
In North Bohren, road championships report a number of bad road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice gleams, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústí n.K. is blocked according to transport police information.
The temperatures also remain in deeper layers below zero, so that snow and ice will be kept on the streets. From the deep levels, especially southeast of the Böhmian Middle Mountains, there are no problems reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disorders have been reported.
Ice slides are reported in particular from the circuit of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this in the night - day-to-day rain and melting snow, in the night cloudless sky and frost.
The main routes and road I/13 at the border of Ústí n.L. and Liberec are reported bad transport conditions.
The locking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to axes which were pressed from the snow load to the roadway.
Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think about that should take place in less than one month of world destruction?
This is one of those catastrophes that we like to jump to people so much.
With our band The Tap Tap, we are more funny about it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's downturn.
In December you will also realise a unique project with three concerts against the world's downturn.
Can you imagine our readers the project closer?
It is a country-wide benefit event that we have planned for two years.
To this end, we want to use the Maya calendar's marketing potential, whose end has been predicted at 11:10 a.m. on 21 December.
On the day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time as at 21:00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be about the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone around 12 hours before us.
Who's this idea from?
Originally, by me, then we designed the idea together with our grapher Honza Augusta.
We want not only to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world's downturn, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once surrender this world to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key trailers against the world, with which the people can also support us with the purchase via www.e-tape.cz.
The Band The Tap Tap has also taken up the so-called hymne against the world's downturn with the title "Worldfall falls out".
Today, the Hymne on YouTube is very popular. Will it find out on the benefit concerts?
Of course, and finally, provided that everything works and the world is not going down...
The hymne is to be sung by all artists on all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are lively transmitted lively by the Czech television.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X singing with...
How did you get to work with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to realizing many benefits events and concerts...
We strive to intensely integrate these people into our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in cooperation with us and have fun with it.
What is the purpose of the redemption of the concerts against world destruction?
For the establishment of the available education centre Studeo, where we have been working for six years with the Association Tap in the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly managed by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a building is intended to be built in which we will then engage in this project.
There are several groups and artists at each concert.
What are the criteria you have chosen for?
We wanted to set up a program that talks to all generations including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý appears in Prague.
Learn more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May, we will first be presenting at the Prague Spring, and we will also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year we would also like to appear in the Czech House in New York, and I personally, if we were in the United States, would like to connect this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small, so far you have already been in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with these trips logically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it appears at the first look.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the baggage room. Of course, we need to drag with many instrument bags and other bags...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I have sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your foreign trips, you have a comparison of how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than with us, we were just witnesses in Russia that in the east, everything is still in its beginnings.
Against Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. There is still unusual when someone in the wheelchair is traveling alone in the city centre.
It is not even obvious that you leave a wheelchair, for example, in the elevator.
Happyly, there are also associations who try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways must we pick up toward the developed countries?
There's still a lot of things in which we're hanging behind...
However, it should be noted that improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the stakeholders.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities can move independently in the public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not just common that there is a larger group of people with disabilities actively involved in social events, we are a little ahead of the band The Tap Tap the West!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our series, things will really begin to change.
To date, these are only individual cases of specially deliberate personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to found a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a maintainer at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensely.
And since I myself am a musician and, among other things, play Saxofon, I founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and with the time, it is, as our modernator, Láجa Angelovič, maintains, something excluded (laugh).
But the band has not been known in the last few years, or do I mislead myself?
It is true that cooperation with known singers has helped us, and we have also started to advertise actively for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and you don't see it outside, your own performance does not exist in some sense.
Thanks to the EU funds, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment and, among other things,
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I felt the potential to deal with things differently.
In the show business, one often copies one another today.
This is logical in his way, since all new things are considered with caution and are only accepted after a longer time.
There are only a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap belongs to them.
The first impression that the audience usually has is, of course, compassion; that is only of course...
But this compassion is absolutely overwhelming because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we must regret.
It is people who can live and develop a full life if they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is not just a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it helpful for this success that you are a strict boss as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and also require a certain discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have samples twice a week, have to graduate preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm will eliminate in many.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
At present, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one of the following: Láجa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Whosoever has the will and the desire to join is always welcome to us.
Does take place on the day before the predicted world decline, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
Event sites are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three places of event are finally connected by live scenario and there is a common interpretation of the Hymne "Worldfall falls out" of the Band The Tap Tap.
The Concert aims to raise the funds for the provision of a multifunctional disabled education centre that should be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
The entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, cards are available in pre-sale at Bohemiaticet.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was the twentieth member of this space authority at a Council of Ministers meeting of the Member States of the European Space Organisation ESA. Poland is therefore the second member of the former Eastern Block (after Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The road of Poland to space began quite a lot earlier.
Before World War II, Polish cosmos enthusiasms took part in space travel, not always in understanding.
I remember here, for example, the lecture of A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Income to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP Hirsch founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934 for "Income to Cosmonauticus".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important prosecutor of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's globally recognised contribution to the development of space travel was appreciated, among other things, by the name of one of the craters on the earthly side of the moon after him.
Already in 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the missile should be used to start or brake the draisine.
The information to this end comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infanterie began to deal with missile shots.
The research carried out the Institute of Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents provided show that research had been carried out until the stage of practical tests.
Research was then freely interrupted by the invasion of the German army.
In 1937, in the specialised press of the design of a photoelectrical hunting draquet, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared in the following year.
Both projects addressed the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the preliminary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komité Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, his work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles about space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company takes place in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, where four extensive articles of space are dedicated.
The article of Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time, there were already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was clear that space research would have a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Space Society PTA tried to join the 1951 International Federation for Space Travel, and in fact the PTA became a ordinary member in the autumn of 1956.
In the following year, the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Vice-President of the International Federation for Space Travel.
He entered this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has contributed significantly to the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was approximately 80 cm long and did not weigh entirely 5 kg.
Later, a improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in 1959 in the Błłdów desert began flight tests with the two-level RM-2 missile.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the raket RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14,5 km and be used for the monitoring of high winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was discontinued.
The first rocket of type RM was the meteor-1 rocket developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-level rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) of these rockets have been developed, which differ in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 litres, meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km for all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2 Rakete was developed at the Aviation Institute, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a 10 kg use load at a height of about 60 km.
Afterwards, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which followed the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites in the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second interkosmonaut after the Czech Republic of Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is no solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit work.
This decision raised a vigorous discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problem from a wider perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with free financial speculations.
Due to the great differences in the value of work ( wages) there are price tensions.
This concept means a condition in which the manufacturer attempts to exist in economic competition through imports of favourable goods by "subsidying competition" in order to break a greater market share in itself and increase its profit.
In large terms, this means for most companies to move or purchase their production abroad, or to discontinue their business; the result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital does not have social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, government expenditure will necessarily increase.
This situation is still reinforced by the fact that the gentlemen are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are overwhelming at this point.
In the individual economies, the unreasonable practice of private capital creates a situation in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own population without taking into account the social consequences of private capital.
This is the case in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital in particular in the field of wages.
This happens one by economic compulsory force on long-term unemployment, and one by cutting out the rights of workers.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poor and rich.
For a few years in Germany, there have been public food supplies for arms that are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work.
The number of people concerned already goes into the millions.
During the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the State must increase their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of the German Federal Day of Aids.
The saving measures will undoubtedly go beyond the same condition that people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a disasterous social crash (as in the 19th century), or to pay for a hunger wage at the edge of society and hope that private investment capital will be flown into the country at any time.
This is naturally the question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty is migrating from one country to another; or capital remains equally entirely because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt or Africa, the employees work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the State may not participate in its own economy with capital and that the planned economy leads to a economic disaster.
Private capital persists closely in its view that the State is not allowed to intervene in the economy.
But then you have to wonder whether private capital does not influence politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense or even lead them.
Here's the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically almighty and all-time lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, the mutual advantage, a legislation, in which practically everything is tough, but nothing can be criminalized.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Ministry of Non-financials is responsible for the preparation of legislative drafts, which are closely linked to the industry.
These draft laws will then be adopted on the Federal Day.
All violence is then no longer based on the peoples as they announce the Western Constitutions, but on strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal Democracies are now quickly in a situation, as Appian describes in its work on the Crisis of the Roman Republic at Caesars and Pompeius' times: "The State has been deceived for long, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against smuggling money, by unlawful declination of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew without inhibition, and the people went on to vote with already purchased voices" ... "Men with character did not advocate for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "You were already talking about that the only medicine in this severe situation was a single rule, and that a strong man had to be chosen"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but then the strong man was then Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with the sole rule.
As it appears, today's society as well as in ancient times is based on the unreasonable preference of its own advantage, without respect for general social interests.
Private capital is not already able from its nature to recognise and implement the benefit of the whole society.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decade of elites who do not in the least seek deep reforms.
The cause for the emergence of fascism and Communism must therefore be searched for in the unreasonable liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
From today's state, the destruction of these regimes to the benefit of liberal democracy can be seen as a certain break, at which the next round is already drawing up.
In particular, the fact that today's elites face the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, humanitarian and social disasters, whose witnesses we are already today, and the crimes against humanity, as we know from the older and newer history, in perfect ignorement.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is no solution here, at least not lasting.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to press down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systematic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the government's participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society to the benefit of the State.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"... that nothing arises from violence or could ever arise" Sing Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "...that we do not forget how violent we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there was no one," says the dying good snaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip there were, as always, a number of reactions.
One of them stands behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians as terrorists; the others, on the other hand, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli State, with the people murder committed to the Palestinian Arabs and describe the State of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write in this place about who is in this ever-recovering waves of killing guilty and who is victim; eventually, the people of Israel today, including the self-administrative areas, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
I am about opening the view behind the scenes to the readers, looking at whom the 95 years of tension (predicted from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot land in the Middle East is mainly serving.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every Epoch we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less evident is the question whether it really always was these personalities themselves who decided their steps independently, or whether behind their throne someone who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hand less individually, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from it has not emerged within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is a special point that could be described as the head of the crown (I don't know if there is any one over them, but I do not exclude this) - the red shield.
A lot is not written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century to stop the connection of their name with high-criminal acts, in which the background was always the strength of their power, the increase of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks they lead wars or are prepared for them (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were seven countries after the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall of Ghaddafis, only four more, where Russia in the meantime had undergone its central bank of the Russian Government).
Anyone who tried to face this family had to pay for it with life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to publish its own banknotes during the civil war and was murdered in 1865 in a theatre.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to cancel the FED - he was murdered in 1963; MEP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to charge the FED for the trigger of the world economy crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global powers of the Rothschilds led to the formation of a plan to dismantle three world wars by Albert Pik, a free murderer of the 33th and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, and by the second war, in particular, the colonial rule of Great Britain should be broken, and the third war should reduce the world population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (a such number would provide for their pleas and luxury and would not even consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the preliminary) and ultimately lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method in which the group of the richest families work with the red shields at the top is the trigger of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so that crises such as those of them are not repeated in 1907).
After they had been able to trigger the first world war by the murder of the Habsburg Thronvolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Zaren Empire by the revolution of Bolsheviks.
The first world war ended with the sudden, military and economically unfunded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zaren Empire was no longer necessary), then the resolution of the Mediterranean great power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to facilitate the second world war, the bankers allowed the politics to create a late conflict situation by occupying Germany with gigantic war repairs; thus they created the condition of poor masses, so that they only had to congratulate the Germans on a sufficiently strong leader who offered the guilts designated and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to take the function of a fifth column and also taken into account to facilitate the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch strived to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; it came to first conflicts with the resident Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was released from the chain at which the international bankers had held it at first, or whether everything was planned, it is only difficult to estimate whether the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in disfellowshipping this war, the Jewish people will be like the second world war as a victim in the leading line of war, this time together with the Arabian or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of dispute and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (you only remember how sharply people were divided into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty man and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only tries wrong in an endless spiral of violence, with at the beginning the desire of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
There must be a distinction between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as with us, the people, only put their own candidates to the choice.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascism attacker, loyally committed to international bankers, who is doing everything in order to facilitate a war with Iran, which, in view of the membership of Iran in the Shanchhaier Organisation for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly expand to a global conflict, and where, due to Iran's control over the only 2 miles wide road of Hormus, over 20% of the world's oil supplies, could be destroyed by the world economy.
In what light the words of David Rockefeller from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is a all-through crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their view, the new world order is a world of men and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristokrates.
A world in which every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to undergo this being of total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the greats, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a sign on their right hand or on their forehead that no one can buy or sell, then he has the sign, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Whosoever has understanding, he considers the number of the animal.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The film Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Teheran and took 52 diplomas as hostages.
For their release they requested the delivery of the crashed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution to the United States, who had preserved the patronate over his regime over decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - she couldn't afford to throw the Shah on board because this would have damaged the confidence of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was not able to implement the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution was supposed to set up a theocratic regime.
It was a serious struggle for the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasko at the violent attempt to free guitars only made everything worse.
The captive diplomas were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been communicated by the algeric government.
The destiny of the hostages called at home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The Debakel in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of director and actress Ben Affleck describes a episode of this story, which declared a small partial victory to the United States.
Instantly before the occupation of the message, six ambassadors escaped.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them to cover their true identity - they traveled decorated with Canadian passports as members of a film staff who was supposed to visit the country's turning location for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also made Hollywood's cooperation necessary.
In order to be credible, articles about this film project appeared in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept long secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic police triller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the history of a successful houser piece, such as the film Ocean's eleven.
This changes the levels of mood in the film - on one side the documentary scenes from Teheran (in the title sequence, iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and even in the film recording of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the relaxing passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and easily overspread.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA Central and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the offices, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable restart of his career with this film.
From a smiled actress, a respectable director has become, and as an actress he is no longer the goal of ironic notes.
Argo is his third game film after the Crime No Child Game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thrill City without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film that doesn't play in the director's home Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that took the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywoods.
Affleck, however, also proves this feeling in Argo, where Teheran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are playing in the streets and showing the reconstruction of events that have really occurred - the entrance sequence of the disturbance of the message is very impressive in their overview, yet, conveying the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect is also achieved by Affleck with his team in fictional scenes (the wrong film stack on a basar in Teheran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to argue with the fact that the history is not actually offering a lot of filming scenes.
But with the few, he works quite successful, sometimes helping the reality - which does not always act as elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Teheran is rejected by a telephony in America, or also the chasing chasing on the startway, acts something artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide spread, which is dependent on the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, and thus they are not in the movie far alone.
Affleck film loses something of traction. It is a film that can be followed with a certain interest with the design and the retro style of a thriller of the 70th years remembering.
But he is very excited.
However, as a reminder of a certainly living piece of history to this day, and as a proof of how overwhelmed the ideas of all-powered and all-knowledge secret services are, it is sufficient.
Guidelines for the blowing up of airballons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who calls on an annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to arrange the competition "Absurdest regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea, the recent EU plan introduced us to introduce a 40% women's rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares for the organisation of this survey, compared with the newspaper Právo.
For example, the nominated absurdities include the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the uniformisation of the insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed a benefit in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible incidences from the EU workshop can be nominated until the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," said Anger.
The controversial EU Regulations include the binding blending of bioethanol into fuels which are naturally harmful in their consequences, and the prohibition of the reliable mercury thermometer of mercury, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or also the Directive on the size of chickens, which became significantly expensive during this year.
In the past, criticism also harvested the factual prohibition of the use of the term "butter stroke" or also the selling ban for conventional bears.
Bananes must be 14 cm long
The EU appliance often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented by one or more Member States in Brussels (e.g. the Czech Republic is currently trying to carry out the claims of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not be "crowde anomalies".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it would only harmonize the inconsistent national standards that would impede trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been raised by the EU against the resistance of some countries, indicating that the existing directives would lead to the waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation last year, which, according to air balloons, must be provided with the indication that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow up the balloon without supervision of an adult.
The EU called on an American study, which, according to airballons, is the leading cause for the incubation of children.
A similar restriction is already applicable for children up to 14 years in the use of yearly market threads.
Curiose invasions are also available at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - everyone who takes an official role in the EU must not use the name of Macedonia for Greece because of the sensitivity of the topic and must instead say FYROM (Formed Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economies Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies in the field of a Member State.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks which could be located on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volume for sulphur conserves, which threatened a high penalty for us.
The organisations of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for having no sea, but of the idea of giving funds for applications for funding.
These ideas were certainly not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by having no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement to the EU," explained the Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that the cereals were very high and the state stocks were overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us, according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission met the Czech Republic so far that it organised an invitation to tender on the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funds for applications for funding offered to the municipalities the Ministry of Regional Development under the Heading of Ministers Pavel Němec (US-DEU) should be concretely appropriations for the settlement of requests for funds to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
However, in the Member States, regulations will easily be the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also the effectiveness and development of the entire European Union, some experts believe that it is more acceptable.
These experts believe that a more serious problem is rather the EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced in the budget negotiations by individual Member States.
Emotions also raise the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win this struggle.
Although, after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, Czech Republic could defend the name "Olomoucké tvar žky", the inland room (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition is back to the 19th century, however, our manufacturers had to rename to "Tuzemák".
The name Rum may only be used for products of sugar tube destillate, not for products of sugar beet.
The official list of products registered in the EU now shows in the society of the world-known cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or the Parmaschinkens, the Karlsbader Zwieback, carpents from Pohořelice and Třeboě, or the Saazer Hopfen.
With a EU brand, the pardubic cooker or the Hořic rolls can be used.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," claims Okamura.
Mr Senator, how do you come to the idea of applying to the President's office?
It's not about being Senator or President.
If everything would work without problems in our country, I wouldn't be able to go anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves run freely, while people are increasing taxes and pension ages.
I had no ambitions to become politician.
But if I see something that I don't like, I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I am already over 40, and for that, independent and parteilos, I have no other way to influence things than the office of a Senator or President.
In the Senate, you did it and then made yourself on the way to the castle.
Do you not turn your electors back?
I have told myself all the time that I will take up the battle for the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that I will be candidate for the President's office, provided that I am elected as Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is a instrument that I can realise my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as strong as possible.
The difficulty is, however, not only that we as a people swallow in the knee and before the TV, but to put down anyone who wants to change something.
To this end, the media that want to rob you the honor, and which confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, it was claimed that I would buy journalists or that I was advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The struggle for the castle you have taken with the these of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retrospective asset statements over 20 million crowns.
To that end, you have to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can submit legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I used myself to ensure that the travel leader remains a free business, and this could be implemented.
The problem is the small spirit policy - if someone comes from the right or left with a good proposal, he is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without carpet thoughts and party ideas from every party.
Do you see yourself as a human in politics rather right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I think the people see me rather to the left.
But for me this right-left thought is totally unimportant.
For me, it's important that we get on.
It's not about whether someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect the people.
I always support publicly every good solution approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
It's not your fault if someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to get closer to this.
This can be described as popularity because of me, but all the proposals I have spoken of are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you will only remain keywords.
And so you will not come far in policy for the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to the people long enough, will you succeed, for example, in carrying out material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
Politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the Presidents of Parliament's parties live on television to legally impose the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the speakers would then have to say why they reject this.
A strong personality that points to errors can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct choice of the President, who was a worth of public pressure.
I'm quite clear that I'm an amateur; I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it fails, I will return to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura Czech Republic should save.
I'm not a rescuer.
I know that I do not reach anything alone; therefore I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they would not also want to candidate for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who rejected work for overload.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered fraud in trade with light heat oil.
My candidatur I started with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of the electorates have not at all gone to the elections, and those who have gone have mostly chosen representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we're only two independents.
People have chosen such a senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of citizens' masters and district heads.
Do you think about the creation of a own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I have no time to check the past of any potential party member, and I don't even have the money for it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account there are only 20 000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about asset statements, how do you look?
My private property is estimated to be about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property of 25 million, a flat of about 10 million, another for 8 million, a collection of arts worth about 10 million, and a Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is about a million worth, and then I have a few million more on the account.
Aston Martin was also a child dream - James Bond always liked me as he drove in the car, was galant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive a Aston Martin, have an asset of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't raise too much interest.
And I am not obliged to defend the campaign from my own resources.
The costs of the campaign are essentially covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live alone from the senator's salary; for example, I could not finance my son the English school, which costs 300,000 per month.
If I just wanted to earn money, I wouldn't be asking for anything.
So do you continue working as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you tell me you're going to run these activities back?
But this is not related to the level of the salary.
As promised, I have partly returned my activities.
For example, my vice-president in the spring becomes the Director of the Travel Office.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live of something, too.
What monthly income did you get used to as an entrepreneur?
Approximately 200 000 to 400 000, and that is still the case.
As President, however, I would set up my businesses completely.
The full conversation is available in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - on the example of spikes and the recently built bookberg - 2 photos
"I like the building fun, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a Passant at the road edge.
And Stefan Spermon, IT engineer in a nearby large business, says, "But, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we need a booklet for today.
All have the Internet, iPad and E-Books.
No man goes to one of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spikes, a hardly visiting sleeping city in front of Rotterdam's gates, are a strange recorder.
The 80 000 inhabitants' community shows the lowest educational rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid situation, a few years ago, one decided to contribute to the general education and to reconstruct the seven fictional bridges that are shown on the Eurocards as beautifully brushed steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensives remained in boundaries.
And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way to become the statistics master: a library must come from!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture Office MVRDV, Master of the great bulb charts and producers of funny and often cynical buildings, took the matter with usual leave and appeared to competition hearing in 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury still looked around and whipped with the axles, the freak maas stacked his readable gifts of size to a pyramid and finished his actionistly supported speech with the words: "Love city communities!"
So he is, my proposal for the Bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros of expensive mountains have been eliminated.
It is part of a revitalisation project, including deep garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent housing and series houses with a total of 50 apartments.
The bookberg was awarded at the beginning of November with the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the familiar small town retorte, which was no longer available until the date than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a rudely horrible council, behind its white facades you would tend to suspect a molecular factory to reach a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
In particular, spices now have the first public culture in the history of their existence.
The Long Way to Book
The first impression: Bookeldorado under cheese bell.
Although there is a lift that leads through the mountain mass, the true room and reader joy can be seen in the feet of topography climbing.
The glassed interior is bright and transparent, the burned clinker floor and the elegant street latches are inevitably speaking the language of a public city place.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You already keep a look at parkbank, dog and football boys and girls playing.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Normally, the books are located along the façade, and in the middle is a large, darker space that is mostly unpleasant and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic space configuration on the head and stolen the reading area from inside to outside.
The inside of the bookberg is well used: In the centre, offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology centre are located.
A special joy are the black books, which are wall clothing, times bathing, times stitching lands.
Optics, Haptics and smell are strange.
Even fleeled architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown construction material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the municipality of spices, on request of the standard.
And so, one day, in a frisian farming, we found an appropriate waste from agriculture.
For many years you have been using a millimetre thin plastic leaf in the Netherlands in crop housing and fields as a root layer.
This is cheap and time-effective.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it is mature for the locker waste.
For the library, the flies - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed into four centimeters of thick plates.
Under heating influence and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is faded into a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bit to a new car and a bit to sports shoes.
After 105 stages, you have reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters walking, you will be rewarded not only in the literature café with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquets and endowed ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but especially for the right air humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a project in puncto ecology," says Trouborst.
Hidden and chilled with soil heat.
Although the bookberg is under a glass storm, the sun itself seems to be within shortly in sunny days.
The wide wooden limbs, which are crossing the glass facade, serve as an estimate and capture a large part of the sun’s radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest make full-automatic rollos.
Stefan Spermon, the first sceptic from the IT industry, already waged the way to the new bookhouse.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who describes the Bookenberg as the "lastly overdue soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every inhabitant was invited to give a book from his personal stock.
First of all, it is intended to fill the optical gaps in the library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has gone up.
The rolls are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-lear library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every inhabitant now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's only a crop.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in the discipline of the Kings, which is called the discipline of identity.
Spigments have written literature history.
As young and unformed she may be.
This is finally a approach point for identity.
Szabo: "German must play a greater role"
Germany has taken part in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in US-European relations, Berlin thus balances at a narrow diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week, Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for a observatory status of the Palestinians with the United Nations.
But then Berlin contained itself.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of his special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time I believe that it does not also support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - but not being too critical to Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also held the vote when it was about setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally carried out by the NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to make a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just turning its foreign policy away from a policy that, as it were, was managed by the United States to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to say that Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policies.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still pressing on their role, but they are on their way to a "normaler" foreign policy.
A foreign policy as they have France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to include positions independent of those of the United States or European partners in national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations to certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain degree different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the attitudes of the neighbouring conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful not to put the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
At least that plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to measure it too much weight, that's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by holding in important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the United States.
That is why I do not believe that this was a dramatic fraction as was in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for this.
Because it signals that it is taken seriously as international players and its interests must be taken.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the United States has clearly spoken for a veto.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American internal policy, these diversities have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama may have a lot of understanding for the European position in secret.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences in opinions are not as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, then Obama is not so excited by Netanjahus politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is currently not the case.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead have to move things out of their own position.
They're just doing that with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play an independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player - will Germany take a major role at all?
Or does Germany still find the leadership role difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, if we look at the Euro-crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German feelings will be free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Thus, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be receptional for various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the United States in European policy continues to decline, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment, but who else remains there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and make them much unloveder - c'est la vie!

"Market Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is also a world-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
A name registered in China, which has nothing to do with the companies of origin, is hidden.
Nevertheless, she enjoys protection as long as the actual nameholders do not complain.
And even then it's not clear if they get right.
"It becomes increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at Taylor Wessing Kanzlei, who is specialized in protective infringements in Fernost.
Every week, a new case is landing on my desk.
The imitators already reach a few additional letters to allow them to register their brands.
Thus, from Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada let you enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also hereby legally copied, such as the sports product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with records from the brand office in Beijing.
On September 14th, 2010, a Chinese company left the trademark Zegna DF Puma, which also served at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that Chinese world championships are in copying and injured intellectual property is known.
In the large cities there are multi-stay shopping houses that sell almost exclusive counterfeiting.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: On behalf of his clients, he argues that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", an advocate mark.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who are fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any debt
"This is business harmful, you have to fight it," Pattloch calls.
"The brand is dispersed, the sole setting disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and process costs of the affected industries go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is with a volume of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, deletion of dubios records in the brand register is difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can move, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court rejected appeals because after the long duration of the claimed name had become "market reality".
If the prosecutor has a pity, he must even pay money to the Plagiator because he hurt his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle here.
Familiar cases also relate to graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction engine manufacturer Sany, that company, who recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
Consequently, the Chinese may use a emblem similar to the Mercedes star to this day.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded of BMW; the dispute was eliminated, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against aftermath from Hong Kong and Singapore, who made the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
The brand office CTMO in Beijing admits that it has been in 2010 because of low staff and space facilities.
Last year, however, we have been returning from the "note situation in the work cycle to normality".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed infringement procedures would be reduced by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 inquiries are still waiting for completion in the Office.
On the other hand, it costs a lot
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection were made at the CTMO, almost one third more than 2010.
This would be a record and mean that for the tenth time China is going to take the list of new registrations around the world, the Authority shall notify.
This also applies to the stock of all valid brands, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan had been charged.
Simplifiedly, each application in the average cost 1280 Yuan or EUR 160.
On the other hand, the case of the German family company Freudenberg is a multitude.
For more than seven years, the group has fought against a Chinese Plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to reach its illegal production of imitation motor vehicles.
However, the imitator continued to secure Chinese rights at the brand Freudenberg.
It has been missed, since family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand office CTMO rejected the objection of the coins as well.
In the next two instances, Joyningenberg got right, but the processor continues to fight until today.
You need to be careful
The case is now attached to the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion and commends the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely exhaustive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were hardly reported, the company archive has even had to look through a hundred years old documents to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg of the opposite forfeited to offer a "high six-digit Euro-digit amount" for settlement.
"Then you see how much this is worth us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in Fernost even threaten to fall back to Europe.
Then, if imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This field of business has long quit the group, yet he was able to reverse the registration.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in businesses with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, the foreigners should "notify everything that is worth protective in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay the other side license fees for your own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pushed out of the market in this segment.
World Aid Day: Stamps, Singing, Help
In Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi - and in Swasiland proudly enjoy AIDS.
The history of a connection that survives more than 8733 kilometres.
First, there's the stamp: cowboystief, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and master lips search the tacquet on the parket floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell on - old, bass, tenor and sopran - insult, devastate and persecute.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old Dirigent, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his sleevely wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi proclaims a new song.
The fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years of age, have come from the human genetiker to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has another text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland.
Aid for Self-Aid
There are about 34 million HIV infected worldwide, which estimates Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swasiland, 245,000 AIDS swaisses live.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 Aidswaisen in the village of Esitjeni, the Verein Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them visit a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take a patent.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means at Zulu storytellers or also praisers.
The bantu language flowingly can speak no one in this room but sing.
For almost ten years the choir songs have practiced soft language in this foreign language and bring it back and again to the place where they originate: in the southern Africa.
For 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice force of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2000 people live there, some are still in simple leather and stroh cabins, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because they are designated to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, all of which are sick: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Cuttings of male precaution, which prove to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly assumed by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swasiland carry the immune weakness virus in themselves, with mid thirty-three death is not rare.
During a common African journey in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, especially but the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, which were not only lacking in parental care, but simply at all: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa", which has been almost professionally careing for the AIDS wheat in Esitjeni.
Features of sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydiene and tripper (Gonorrhö).
Frequent viral STIs are HIV, human papilomavirs, herpes genital or hepatitis.
Filtles and scratches belong to the parasitary STI.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and Tripper occur especially in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of the Syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
Chlamydiene infections, trichomonads, candidose (pilz), trippers and human papilomavirs are commonly transmitted.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this country - nevertheless, around 20 percent of HIV re-infections fall from this group.
Chlamydiene infections occur considerably more frequently in adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections relate to young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, human papilomavirs are frequently observed in young people in these countries.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of Syphilis infections has doubled more than 3698 diseases in 2011 from 1697 diseases in 2001.
The number of HIV re-infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms indicate a gender disease?
Infection diseases may cause ulcers in the genital field, urination disorders, excretion, underwear, and bleeds or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide a hundred percent protection.
Because, in part, inducers of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by smurry infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular studies especially in frequently changing sex partners.
Earlyly diagnosed, most STIs can be healed and late results can be avoided.
Through patents, donations and not least the gages that the choir sings throughout Germany, some things come together.
"Toall, we have already sent about EUR 200 000 to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and persecutive woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also cares for the beasts to be well covered with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as called the old women on Zulu, are the supporters of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 beasts, give them a roof over their head and make sure that children appear timely for school education every day in their uniforms.
Whoever has no more comes into the protective house to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as the two cookers who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" launched a secondary school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American Health Organization PSI that many in the village have made an HIV test.
This is not self-consciousness, because as obviously the disease in the whole country is also, one swears it most dead.
A King with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute tabu," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually weird in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also guilty of this stately sanctified life form that the HI virus has spread so quickly in the past decades.
But also the many hiking workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms exist at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor travels all two, three years together through the southern Africa and sings songs full of temperament, battle spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many know at the southern summit of the Black Continent from times of apartness.
A bus full of white men who sing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but has already put some cruel border soldiers a few tears.
The journey is always going to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their fathers' children.
Even if the small village is hardly found on maps, it is more known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Going to Esitjeni, there's the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometers airline to Heidelberg, to the stampling singers in the test room on the Bergheimer Straße, then you see it also shine.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US Space Authority NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet's Mercury.
Although it is next to the sun, there is also frozen water, as is found in three studies published on Thursday in the "Science" magazine.
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is an iron cover in the permanently lying area of the planet.
This shall be at least 30 centimeters and may even be up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly also asteroids that are enslaved on the Mercury.
No one brings the foundation of ice but relates to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger Son, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building stones of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth's citizens, sunshines, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send pictures to the earth: Small guck holes in infinite wide.
The picture comes from a camera that developed German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who creats around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the 2006 International Astronomical Union.
This image section of an infrared recording of the Spitzer telescope shows a "Family portrait" of unnumbered star generations: The oldest stars are identified as blue points, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborn" in the stars' hall.
This star-figuring region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the star image Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This glowing glow of a dead star has taken up the top telescope of Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star swallowed out in the death process.
In the huge trifid nebula, 5400 light years away from the earth, the gas and dust produce new stars.
The Spitzer telescope of Nasa shot this photo of the galactic studio.
The Plejaden star hop, also called "The seven sisters", can be seen with the only eye in the night.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebel looks at this infrared photo to the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star image.
His similarity to a earthly continent, this fog introduced the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides the spectacular colouring.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: As these have been created, one of the great puzzles of astronomy.
They may have been the remains of a Saturn-Mond, which disappeared instantly 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool galaxy
Depending on colouring, recordings of spiral galaxies become true artworks.
The recording published by the European Southern Queen shows the trifid nebula in the star image protector, which is several thousand light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-parted, three-parted) as dark dust stripes threeth the glowing heart of the stars' birthplace.
Astronomers photographed the predecessions of a cosmic caram company in the starry snakes: 400 million light years away from the earth, the cores of two melting galaxies are racing together and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Whose technical abbreviations do not lie, may call them at their nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows an excerpt from the iris nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The 1400 light years away fog consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than the usual dust of houses.
This image was combined from optical and X-ray recordings of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the Hubble space telescope for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy calls scientist UGC 1810.
The brightest group of young stars is our dairy road.
The starwife always produces new youths.
These star clouds, associated with the rosette nebula, also bring up new baby stars at a time - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this light-raying galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was created only shortly after the urknall, when most of the hydrogen was found in the universe.
Our insights in the All: The main telescopes
The telescope is supposed to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observance one year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown - and the insights they provide have grown.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest remote tube in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The big Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows looks into the All equally over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Yet, he reaches a diameter of about 11 metres.
Disadvantage of the cheap construction methods: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus restricted in its mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
His speciality: the high light collection power.
This is sufficient - despite a relatively small mirror diameter - to the world's largest mirror telescope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers hear all outdoor signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help any computer owner by providing accounting performance.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here's the Very Large Telescope, which makes his name all honor.
With its total four mirrors, the remote tube can also light the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror will comprise 42 meters - and will be composed of nearly 1000 mirrors.
However, pictures can be calculated at the earliest 2018.
By 2007, the two chain telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer equally two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which, besides them, still looks in the sky with the subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new, huge telescope will also be created on the Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be surprised on an illustration.
The main impressions from the All, however, provide the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already delivered pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolar planets - mainly for those inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates have been determined since the start of mission.
In the picture, the last start preparations on the space telescope Kepler are documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot on board a Ariane5-raket in early 2018.
The primary level of the space infrarotelescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the urknall.
Scientists assume that there is also at the South Pole of Mercury Ice.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the messengers cream far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been suggesting for decades that there is ice on the Mercury.
Through the messenger sound started in 2004 - the first that creats around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter every day - and become 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible - high age.
There is even a museum for long-life.
A track search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible - high age.
There is even a museum for long-life.
A track search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The ride through the Talysch mountain is wilddromant.
The small bus crumbs over the curven-rich road, passing on tight forest hills, riping rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and soft, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here lives the Caucasian group of Talyks, of which is not much known, except that it is perfectly Persian, as well as Azerian, and is very long-living.
End station is Lerik.
The small town is widespread with too vigorously broken Soviet architecture, which does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are hardly coming here, too difficult is the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometres you will need eight hours because the road is only single.
The magnificent wealth that the country owes its oil in the Kaspian sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita documented by about eight dozens of valleys from the area, older than 100. Fatulayeva refers to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he became 120 years old.
A child born at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is the sheephirt Şirali Müslomov, who is supposed to have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented people who became 122 years old, Müslomov's age seems very doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times, and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he should have given another daughter.
So did Şirali Müslomov figure out at his age about a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the high-paids in Central Asia.
"Baby many high-aged people also exist in some parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, extremely many very old men live."
However, due to lack of evidence, no scientific evidence of age should be provided, especially as the status register was missing.
Bigly melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years old.
So why live so many high-aged people here in the south?
Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talyks.
Museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is on the diet.
However, it is not just plausible from nutrition scientific perspective that the caloriasic cost of the valleys is calculated to be so healthy that the meat, bread and especially milk products love and of which many are drinking a glass of butter that is melted daily.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? In Cengeiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With her 97 years, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Kaukasus region.
She sits on the floor with a buttercase that rolls her down and down inevitably.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are grandparents long.
Two kids also jump around.
In the kitchen you prepare the guests tea that is served in the typical, built-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly in rain and leather, under her head cloth she hides long, dark-blown teeth that reveal their son proudly before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out of me and kept their color.
"Shampoo I never used," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pensions are sufficient to live
She has always eaten what came from her own court, tomatoes, potatoes, herbs.
I haven't bought food in the supermarket for my whole life.
Then she tells her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the time after World War II.
But everything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the rod.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the culture that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, later his son Ilham took over the ruder.
There is no disaster among Azerbaijan's old ones.
230 Manat (e.g. the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension for these conditions a amount of which you can live well.
And maybe Mirzayevas has long been right: "The old ones enjoy high respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the big family, be loved, cared and are happy.
If this is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing in the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalising census in Cairo reveals the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with Sharia as a basis is severely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not save with Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but in particular to the Christian copies, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and Seculars.
Because they all, so far hopelessly crushed in a confusional opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God at the Nile of Graces of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He, said Mohammed Mursi almost apologize for temporarily cutting the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanding his competences, "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer who has a doctoral title at the American University of South California really wants to save is the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear about it.
Should the Judicative be evacuated?
In fact, the 234 articles that have been put through by the 100-head Constitutional Assembly dominated by Islamists are partly exciting in a nightly, 15-hour parforcerite.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principes" mean?
This was and is an interpretation and it is fearful that Islamists will use the sweating formulation and the resulting legal space for a more stringent interpretation of Sharia.
At least a newly added article suggests that in all the matters concerned with Scharia, Al-Ashar University must be taken into account, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiation in the whole of the Sunnitic Islam.
This does not have to do, but it may mean that the clergy supervises the law, which de facto leads to the dismantling of the Judicative.
Interpretation is a matter of much in the draft authorization
Also problematic: civil military jurisdiction will continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak’s rule to suppress oppositional ones.
After the crash of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians sat in military prison.
The State should also, according to the draft, "the true beings of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morality and their values".
This is legally so uncertainly formulated that state institutions can even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In the plain text, this means nothing but censur.
No article else explicitly describes the equality of men and women.
For this another forbids the prophet Mohammed and his messengers to blame or blame.
But what is an insult and how it is to be obscured remains unclear.
Similarly, dubios courageates the formulation that the "insult of men" is prohibited.
Is there already a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
Interpretation, as is so much in the draft Mursi to be signed and, according to his words, the Egyptians will be presented to vote for the people.
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming against the power of Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual agreement on Friday evening on the Tahrir Square in Cairo and praised to bring the Charter to fall before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential elections.
Peace Nobel Prizeholders and Ex-Chef of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei declared that the draft Constitution belongs to "the wasteberg of history".
Through a short news service, Twitter, he advocated Mursis to want to lead a "Putsch against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and crash him," said the oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet reconciled," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, making it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well organized Muslim Brotherhood, on its own, blew to the contemporary demonstration, but not to be careful on the Tahrir site, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer before the Cairo University.
Many swallowed women and followers of the Salafists took part in it and cried out: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They asked by Mursi, "Sauberes the Land!" and deepened, "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the Highness over the symbolic Tahrir place, on which everything took its beginning, probably would have encountered civil war-like conditions.
Obviously, Mursis trailer didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the constitutional draft and the advocates would have expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide on the electoral ceremony in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists' drafts are considered to be safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone until February and have to engage all social forces.
The 48-year-old lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organisation (EHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or before court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world views, but because human rights are individual to him.
He was struck, condemned, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in discussion with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi enlargement of power to all three forces in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are irrelevant infringements of democratic game rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto disappears it," Saeda complains.
But without civil society organisations, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, who looks at the ideological direction struggle at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revenge.
A demonstration on the Tahrir warns: "You are born a monster that you can't control anymore."
Rakfish from Norway: Is this the most evil smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the country's success secret have something to do with local appetite on pretty bad smelling fish?
You take a selection of overwhelmed cheese varieties.
They are placed in the middle of a bunch of dirty, damp sports clothes.
And leave them there for a week.
Sometimes you have to imagine the nose deep smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delicatesses of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this thorough smell in the air, which simply doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a salt-spread forel, which - depending on how stinkling one would like his fish - is fermented in water up to a year.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather becomes colder, Norweger flows to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, now, really very coupling speciality.
"You eat it raw and then wash it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halfarsen, who actually works in the local fireguard, but also organises the festival as a so-called "rakfish general".
People around us consume small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfish," says Havard.
The spiritosis can disperse the smell.
I'm costing some bits.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfish near the nose, it isn't bad - like Sushi, who has a very long bus journey behind.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, far worse Norwegian era when there was no cooling opportunities yet and fish was drowned in airproof salt water vessels in autumn.
In the deep winter, he was then taken out after long fermentation and, doubtless, consumed by alcohol.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegers were forced to leave their country in search of work and mostly wandered into the United States.
Today the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a florating labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival who was not far richer than Norway before, flows immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - an essential part of the Norwegian history, though strictly smelling.
He's one of the more expensive courts that you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich cost proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often get it into the world press, and most people do not seem to disturb it.
Here it is still hated to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist legal extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, one refers only to the "incidence of 22 July".
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peace - loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for the present richness of Norway has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we're doing so well," says Anna, our cellar, distributing the round tablets with mature rockfish and with her long blonde hair and the steaking blue eyes the Nordic ideal.
We are a careful people - as you say.
Your English is just like that most people here makeless.
We're not very obsessive, we don't like praise.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the industry's income is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years until the world economic crisis, all of them were thrown around with money that they did not have, Norway held his stock exchange firmly closed.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and walking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eat Rakfish," she adds with unheated laugh.
I'm standing in the snow and standing for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
That's a eel-burger, at least, is something different, and the soft meat is gonna be my mouth.
But in the evening, the stinkfish is back on the food plan.
The hotel where I stay is one of several places of event that organize a racfish dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - smells.
There is a live TV scenario to a fly-coated showmaster surrounded by plates with racfish.
The spectacular is similar to the Eurovision Song Competition.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You're climbing and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the Aquavit.
But maybe it is the stringent dust of all the fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his entry, Will Grant of the BBC analyses the challenges he faces and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is very bad.
Even in better days, this is a stuck city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built that locks several important roads to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
The aim was, however, not to disturb Pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bonds and take the lead of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the divorced government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to prove well economically, but the country is under the control of a drug war that has already cost 60 000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," explained Pena Nieto at the Oval Office at the beginning of this week to American President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this objective.
Before he went up with the U.S. president, Pena Nieto worked as governor of his home country of Mexico.
In this closely populated large part of the country surrounding the capital, the opinions on the new Head of State are divided.
A direct man
For example, in the distant small town of Valle del Bravo you like to remember him.
Inhabitants of the vacational site advocate the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the motorways that made Pena Nieto build and represent a great improvement to the broken, hollow roads that once existed here.
Plaques with its name also hang outside a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and persistent changes from him," said his friend and political alliance Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as Congress Member of the Party Pena Nietos, who works as PRI.
In particular, with regard to security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was released by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congres member Olvera admits that after 12 years, the party has made great expectations to Enrique Pena Nieto outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos.
The punishments of opposition, the new president lacks the substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent stateman, but in particular he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and in many respects represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are crucial to urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was activated to combat the drug bands operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large waste deposit, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left alone in the last two years.
During the term of office of governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is famous for their violence and murder of innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not addressed the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes before the problem.
In a concrete construction, typically for the depreciated quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me photos of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her companion.
"When I came home to her, it seemed as if her body washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was struck, and the body star had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana looks down on us. It is appropriate next to a cross that wears a single word: justice.
But just these, the family, they have been rejected her until now.
The authorities treated me as if I was a speaker, an alarmmaker, a Nörgler.
They want you to accept their judgment and keep your mouth.
"But this is not possible if there were so many form errors and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bond on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been compassionate by violence crime in the last six years, and the new President has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope that as President, he is the way he was governor," says the PRI Congress Member Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But just for that, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid.
The prosecutor claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The State Prosecutor contradicts Bradley Mannings' claims that he had been abused in prison
The hearing deals with Mannings time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks a rejection of the prosecution due to severe imprisonment conditions
The liberator of the U.S. army is condemned to have devoted thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the State Attorney tried to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused of the greatest disclosure of confidential information in the US history - failed to complain about his supposedly suffered abuse in militaryity.
At a cross interrogation of Mannings during a pre-judicial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fine explained that documentation for weekly visits that prison officials had made during Mannings nine months in Quantico, Virginia, did not show any complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross trial, which was held due to a request for defence to reject the accusation - Manning had already been punished sufficiently by the hard prison time - Manning had said that he had considered suicide in prison.
The Secret Service Analysis of the U.S. Army, arrested in June 2010, is conceived to have stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fine with Manning went through the forms that officials had completed after their meeting with Manning during his prison in Quantico Military Prison, where he had set up under enhanced prison conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had considered the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a whole as "very professional".
The forms, according to fine, did not contain complaints about abuse, although the officials Manning had consulted directly on his treatment.
Manning answered that he expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated to deal with them, but they were not logged.
"They wrote "No problems", and that did not necessarily mean that I said nothing at all," said Manning.
The judge, Oberst Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 that should examine the suicide thoughts mentioned by him a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status to "prevention of injuries".
The military said that it assigned him this restrictive status - one stage under the suicide threat - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that it was good for me, and lose the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning said that he was arrested and moved to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was arrested nearly two months before he was transferred to the Quantico Marine Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he thought of suicide and had become unconscious due to the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or to the outside world had been burdensome.
"My world shrinked on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
He was only allowed one mattress, a ceiling, flip-flows, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because the day it was forbidden to sleep or just lay down.
He has always had to sleep with light that ended from outside into his cell.
When he turned around in the night and he couldn't see his face again, he was woke up to turn back.
In January 2011, Mannings' lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011 Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked for an accusation that he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he slept a night naked in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked before guards and other prisoners at an morning counting.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity during this counting to cover himself with his ceiling.
During the Friday survey, Manning announced that he had closed from a command of his guard that he should have dropped the roof with which he could have covered himself, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday Manning had said that he was forced to sleep naked in the last night. He had previously tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said to the official that he could have used the covenant of his underheads or his flips to hurt himself, but not.
This night, Manning said, his underheads, Flip-Flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will take at least into account his prison experiences and drastically reduce his burden of arrest, he should be condemned before the military court in his proceedings, which is appointed for the beginning of the next year.
The defence has indicated that Manning will be guilty of smaller infringements, while other points of charge that are considered too extreme are to be contested.
The hearing is continued for this weekend. The lawyer is expected to justify the terms of prison.
The Pentagon remains at its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners kept under the highest safety precautions in Quantico.
The complaints against Manning include the benefit of the enemy, the unlawful publication of confidential information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all charges, he is threatened with a lifelong penalty.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them into memory difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport check when no rat in me.
Signs refer to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicanians"), another for "Extranjeros" ("External").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain to what I should go to.
I grew up in Central California and was called Mexicans all my life.
An ethnic accelerator - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Irene" or my friends in New York "Italian".
Later, I decided to be "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for accelerators or bindings.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I'm not going to lose my American accent too.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the serpent for extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda, all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in speaking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason why Mexicans today remain with the same probability in Mexico instead of emigrating to the United States.
He wants to connect to the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block in the form of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartel, even if he did not call any details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States fell into Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country under a guard to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, reminders of this event are not to be overlooked.
So once a U.S. official exercises only the mildest criticism of Mexico, it is hearing - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans compress the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezumas go on the war path.
And yet, the greatest challenge of Mexico in truth lies in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentments?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for which the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent part - did not have an opportunity to go north to Mexico.
And in most cases this person matched a profile - darkly, unformed, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, have visited good schools and have received good jobs, we must never lose our mind that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but what our loyalty concerns, this is not the case.
This is clearly true of the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Leadership of Mexico do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
They see us as a memorial of humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Your opinion is that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves captured behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and was legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans are disappointing them.
While she is US-American citizens, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they are neither one nor another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springstein.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but it is not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational citizenship want to reopen their connections to Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and pressure on political leadership to intensify their commitments to Mexico.
Well.
This won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, the unwaited corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through there alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans have not yet been willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico some half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans are wrathful about how their family members were not treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "mexican" than I thought.
Old fights, new Middle East
The state of arms between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to shock such a hope in the arch.
In the middle of the ordinary debt assignments, many buildings were laid in shots and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelites killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza were enslaved near the Israeli metropole Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israel and Palestinians seem to be caught in their historical conflict, the Middle East changes around them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these fools.
Perhaps this will only lead to more blood pouring.
But there are reasons to assume that the deadly patch situation could finally end.
A war that is not lost or won
At first sight optimism seems to be anything other than appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the arms stopped on November 21, this week's fights have strengthened the hard-to-doers on both sides.
The leader of the Hamas, the Islamic movement that has controlled the Gaza stripes since 2007, is claimed to have repulsed the Israelites, although its grouping itself had to suffer great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1,7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are adhesied in one of the desolatest and most densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not managed to destroy the Hamas until now.
In fact, the Hamas in the western continent is gained, which is controlled by the rivalating, moderate Palestinian group of Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world have gained influence, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a resurrecting, regional power that was once the narrowest Muslim alliance of Israel, has taken up for the Hamas Party, just like Qatar, one of the richest and dynamicst golf states.
Delighting Hamas adherents believe that Israel forms a Islamic semi-money - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has the power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamic impression could stand before the fall of Bashar Assads, to Jordan, where Hamas' bonds threatened the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the most inhabitant and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel, has sustainedly changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizist despot, who ruled Egypt until his fall in 2011 for 30 years, had only little time left for the Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are strongly dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas could prove to be a player who cannot be pressed out by Israel and the United States itself.
On the other hand, the Israeli Hardliners draw a opposite conclusion.
Militaryly, the Hamas is no longer in danger.
The Israeli rocket defense system, "Iron Dome", has been able to prove and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep quieter.
In diplomatic terms, the United States holds inevitably on their position, and many European countries have made the Hamas responsible for the latest scales of violence.
Israel has been well found in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamine Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process for many parts.
Although rockets from the Gaza strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide killers - not least thanks to the locking plants that are entering into the western continent and thus to the main part of any Palestinian State. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared unlawful, but continue to be expanded.
Netanyahu is well there. His Liquud party joined with a even more fighting group in front of the elections on January 22, under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why are these disgusting Palestinians also obscured and left them a own state?
If they were actually controlling the western continent, would they not fire rockets like their fellow fighters in the Gaza strip?
No, it's better to keep them in chess and punish them, they should dare to lift the heads.
Maybe the Hardliners will be able to go through, but the Arab spring could make them a stroke through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who are now in Egypt and other countries have little power left for Israel, they will focus first on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense set of Israel is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to maintain their economy.
The fact that the pragmatic President Mursi joined Barack Obama in order to reach a gun stop could be a promiseful sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israeli should also think more long-termly.
While the rest of the Arab world takes sightful steps towards democratization, Palestinians will continue to deprive their self-determining rights - a powder phase that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied areas, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only intensify.
Bloody missions to withdraw the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an insistence from outside
The right answer is those represented by the wiser representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two countries where Israel leaves areas for security purposes.
The hope - for the near future small - is that the arms stop will give outsiders more influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt now has to stop the arms deliveries in the Gaza strips together with Turkey and Qatar and is better positioned than ever before to convince the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have been done more for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also help to move Israel into negotiations.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house it seems like he's also rejected a participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for single cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and diseased parts of the body on neutral green packs equal to all tobacco marks
The world's first laws for single cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia. This will replace brand logs and colours with neutral, olive green covers, which are also printed with drastic pictures, showing sick parts of the body and cigarette smoking infants and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small fonts is the coming Saturday.
So Australia introduces the most stringent tobacco packaging schemes worldwide.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from smoking by eliminating the glamourous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke with 26 will no longer start with 99% probability afterwards.
"You can see in young ages that they understand the message to apply tobacco companies with their brand picture," says Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies, for example, that children have shown to be associated with the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia is one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will only have a small impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The Tabaclobby struggled hard against the laws.
So it was said that the laws would favour the black market trade, which leads to cheaper and easier accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre by British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the roads of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have encouraged their business.
Sandra Ha von Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarettetuis and silicone covers to cover the inexpensive packaging has risen enormously since the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan tobacco companies failed two months ago at the Supreme Australian Court of Justice with their objection to the laws.
Zico sold up to 6000 units in wholesale businesses and was waiting for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the crochet is in the popularity of social media to the precise population to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, banning them to enter as sports sponsors and forced most dealers to stop interpreting cigarettes in businesses. Now the tobacco advertising has been switched to the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"He who has tobacco marketed and has only a small area left to apply for his products, will not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on brands written by "all normal people".
You have to ask yourself, is this just a private person who finds so great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she even records a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry focuses on marketing instead of dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new regulations - those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions in the world trade organization, although none of the countries operates larger trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid 2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted discussions with other countries which consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country for which photographic warnings were written in 2001.
In the meantime, these have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are proud.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a pitch and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when you buy a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the city centre of Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his rods.
"I used an hour before to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should simply have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have told us all right, that's it, we're closing," he evidently adds in forest.
In a constantly electricized world it is nice to be bored even once
This thanksgiving I spent indefinitely five hours at the airport when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flyer.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts of boring.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course free of tax) are available.
But more and more academics and children’s development experts are slower than something positive.
When it comes to them, it's for us - and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constantly staring on the one or other screen, the advantages of the misery are no longer benefiting us.
So should we welcome the distress with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll get back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boring is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing recreation.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see this.
"In fact, the boring has a very long story," he says.
The house walls of Pompejis cease a Latin grave fiti over Langeweile, which goes back to the first century.
And then there is the question how we actually define boring.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that Langweile has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long lecture of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boring is the experience of "a satisfactory activity but cannot be defined".
As a result, as a result of apathy, the person is not busy but wants to be.
On the other hand, there is no need for apathy to do something.
The key experience of the boring, he says, consists in a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with bad noise and the feeling that the time only goes slowly."
Sadly, it can sound almost like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions could be related, the problem in their surroundings or in the world is seen, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we have only trouble focusing.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German, for example: "The inactive sense: The definition of langweile under the aspect of attention" appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment when listening to a band on which a person reads a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring space that had nothing to do with the content. Others listened to low volume, so it was hardly perceiveable, while the third group did not at all hear these noises.
The people who had the hardly hearable television indicated that they felt more boring than the two other groups - they had problems with focus, could not find any reason for them and wrote to their difficulties in the long-term.
When you try to focus on a difficult or hard task, the disturbance of attention can lead to Langeweile, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you exercise a single-tonish activity - "like the search for wrong products on a factory support tape, music can distract and help to not feel bored".
Actually, he says, we now know that inheritances and crustles, often interpreted as signs of misery, can even fight them by keeping people more physically aware.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hook around learn more and keep more information than those that are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a dry speaker, a particularly tired movie.
But some people are more boring than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scala to prolongability".
On the scale there are statements like "Many things I have to do repeat and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
As a result of such scales, researchers have found that boys are often boring than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida, especially as regards the need for more and a greater diversity of external travel.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty relaxed bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, carried out an experiment in which he contacted a pager seven to eight times a day with almost 400 teenagers and their parents.
He found that 32% of the adults in the school and when doing the homeworks were bored, while 23% claimed to be bored if they weren't in school.
But only 3% of the parents claimed to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know whether the percentages have risen or declined with regard to the long - suffering.
However, he is sure that "the youth will be felt particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their everyday life.
So get back to my question of origin: Is langweile healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme case, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and to lose gambling or drugs to facilitate them - that has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between langweile and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has explored the topic for over two decades.
"The brain wants to tell you something else to do," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do best.
If you're boring and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
However, television can provide short-term feelings of happiness, but these refugees again in the long term.
Thus, if you have enough iPad for your tired child, you can get it away from the boring. However, it has not learned to talk or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds, "Self-control is transferred from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to entertain but also to gain more self - control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate.
We should also not see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to feel well, apart from the constant activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be more bored, but boring is the grievous, unpaid desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people in truth are just looking for one way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to occupy once the noise is stunned."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco in the southeast of Colorados stands for a crime before court that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some less marijuana fractures and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer had found Marihuana in the car, Orozco was invited for the possession of drugs and drug expertise - cavalry offences, which each have a punishment of $100 - and received a judicial date.
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks after the State's decision to legalise small quantities of marijuana for its own use, the answer for hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of infringements around marijuana are already dropped here and in the State of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities are no longer persecuting adults over 21 years of age for minor possession, which is legally permitted as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next weeks.
But state lawyers in the more conservative areas of Colorados have announced to pursue existing marijuana delicates and still quote people before court.
At the same time, several cities, from the forests of Denvers to the Western Mountains, will prevent new, stately licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I don't even know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, Head of Police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And also regulators in the state of Washington crawl on their heads without advice.
They are waiting for a orientation aid for the establishment of a license system for the production, manufacture, sale and sale of the drug - with a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado in any case is the predecessor of the states as regards marijuana regulation. There the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consuming.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. Therefore, the State is well suitable for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the Supervisory Authority for Spirituosen in the State of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a gross guide.
"We have no real precedent which we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus also forms the end of a grey zone in which the State License System has not yet existed but has been legalised.
And unpleasant practical questions must be addressed at this time - for example, how to agree the state requirement of a "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis businesses around 300 metres about schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Neverwhere it will be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the urban area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, speaker for the Centre for Legal Cannabis, a recently educated research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent his employees to Aurora an e-mail in which he declared that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana dependencies in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would not seek "off immediately" penalties for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to implement urban regulations for farmers of medical marijuana and continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County in the north of Colorados, district prosecutor Ken Buck represents a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
At present, 119 persons must be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana before court, although many were also charged for other crimes.
"Our authority has the duty to persecute infringements at the time of acts of criminal offences," said Buck in a statement.
The reactions are twofold in places such as the Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana initiatives.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to let all outstanding ownership procedures fall.
"I don't think I'm spending my time using the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to agree the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a deep-ranging pivot among local officials with regard to the large green experiment.
In the case of district lawyers, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the prosecutor of marijuana law and acts locally as a speaker for the national organisation for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their life in pursuing people criminally that they are still unable to accept legalisation," he believes.
As the first countries who treat smaller quantities of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national patterns for legalisation of drugs.
While speakers and officials are preparing for a age of legal sales, they are at the same time waiting nervously for instructions from the Federal Government, which will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at federal level as criminal offences.
Advocates of the Legalisation Movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several magnificent arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuanas, the Federal Government has authorized the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other countries.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy consultant of the Obama Government, believes that although criminal officers are likely not going to enter any doors to capture smaller quantities of drugs, they are likely to expose the legal, stately regulated marijuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved Moratories for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban that is probably adopted next week.
"We don't want to go into a position where we license someone and then face a major problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this legislative change.
We are directing ourselves to what the community has decided for and not to what the State has decided for.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was murdered from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only today's university students are attacked for their views
It had always been my greatest dream to have a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I once thought was the world's largest knowledge stamp, as a modern Greek symposium that promoted the large pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entrance at Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcase again and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the evening standard, it said I had gone because I had a problem with the fact that comilitons in the neighbouring room had sex.
Author A N Wilson declared schelmically that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged bags.
But the truth was less entertaining.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran because I suffered from systematic mobbing and threats.
Not because of my quite unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
For one reason I was shocked - one reason that seemed to have been in this alleged way of lighting about so thorny and cruel: My deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important consultant Margaret Thatchers and I advocate the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffers from similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred on Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them demanded the same protection of equality, benefiting from dizziness, disabilities and ethnic minorities last week.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College declare that they are often inactively isolated, personally attacked and declared unwanted because of their political views.
They require a place in the Equality Committee of their College to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was worsened by a recent documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which tories represented as an excentricist and neonazist.
This was shown among other things by Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and protrude with silver-coloured dress and silver occupied gostock.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered to be "sound bucks for the introduction of higher study fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is an increasing link trend in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club, without having ever met us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a history student in Corpus Christ, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, appointed President of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, has observed a growing rejection against students of the moderate rights in JCR members.
"This presents a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredible shocked 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred on the Conservative Party had reached its highlight.
In the previous year, the university had voted for not giving Margaret Thatcher - a former student - a title of honor due to reductions in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have made stalinists scared.
In the first days of the first semester week, where new students meet themselves and the tutors, I received a taste of future events.
I made the experience that the tutors did not only tolerate the spotting of tory students, but even with joy.
Political topics such as mining work, privatisation and rejection of the government of sanctions against the Apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wooden-tailed rooms of the Tutorium.
At my first events, I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been caught on what would then come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the Tutor Harry Pitt (in the meantime died), "translate the first paragraph."
I stolped with it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like cake dew, and quite haughty.
"Rejecting thatcher attachers to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students cooked.
In my eyes, wearing up tears.
"I suggest they take a few French hours in your leisure time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt murmured me.
I returned back to my room with hanging head.
That evening, I was sitting at college alone at dinner, when someone easily tipped me on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who imagined himself as a member of the Conservative Students Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's like it's.
Everyone who is suspected to be Tory will be tribulation.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher is near, so it'll be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters prescribe to be adherent to the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to move later.
I was insisting that I wasn't at all points with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
A study beginner in the field of philosophy, politics and economy, who ironically had visited the Eton College as a conservative, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How's Tories sex?" one asked me.
They're beating each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in living a normal life at the University of Oxford?
Would I be able to meet equally-minded ones only after the darkness is invaded?
Should I turn to the Labour party and suppress my natural tendencys?
The three years before me, before my spiritual eye, stretched to a feast of arrogance and isolation.
The only tutor to recognize himself as tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservater, but also because he had consulted thatcher in matters of foreign policy and written speeches to them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincially and inferior and rejected him for his marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997 he adopted a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to pendle between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more enthusiastic friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford and why I did.
He seemed unbelievable.
During his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said smallly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my Communist friends always showed proper ways.
His moist eyes thrust.
Give it all a chance.
I'm sure you're just nailed.
It would break my heart if you went.
With my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also tory followers, had given up the pressure and rejected his beliefs.
During a tutorium the next week, where another story student seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I was in secret of shame, I admitted that my parents had undergone me a "hearing wash" and called her "old fool".
The facilitation took only a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in my Oxford carriage.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my sharks gave up.
When they went, I packed a bag and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You'd like to call me a weeping shaft.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and evilness in an educational institution.
And more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that did not only produce 14 Prime Ministers of Tory, but hides behind a undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of famousness"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which this week was opened in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian modemacher.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worth the accommodation of an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognized by the designer when opening "Valentino - Master of the Couture", a great retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the skin Couture were composed, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unforgettable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but without its distinguished clients couldn't have been written.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the sticky and remote world of the Adel.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be seen until 3 March, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most read aristocratic, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, over the Princess Marie Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of his social rise from the modest modemacher in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love with the Adel doesn't have to be of disadvantage.
"They don't put their chickens on your glorious carpet, as it does some beautiful fames from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the modemacher.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his house for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music was recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," remembers the "top model", which began their course at the week of Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes from the fashion because his designs are artworks," she concludes.
Modal view of the origin
Garavani's life is not a story of concession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 meters long run, which suggests a rolling exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the walking step to admire a dreamful "audienz", the masterpieces of Valentino wear, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti was wearing in "La Notte", or a mantel of wool and leather, which the emperor Farah Diba had.
In this audience of fashion pops, names like Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemacher, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a West type of "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift of him," says Naty Abascal, one of the museums of the designer.
"I attract him to everyone else because of his great love for the women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Hertogin of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The ratios are perfect.
The princess and opinion leader at the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time when she had a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
Finally, the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in my father's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying rock and a murdered top with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a real dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, its occupation is timeless," explains this Italian Aristokratine, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening clothes of the modemacher "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress but also the related memories".
The "König" of the Mode
The big final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the modem called his nearing runs) were necessary to make this ivory-bone silk dress with pearls, twelve different stickers and a four and a half meter long sweep.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the skin of Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years with the "savoirêtre" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, excellent with the honorary alliance, Garavani cumulates as many honours as every man of his clients.
"I always notice his refinement, his silence, his careful and perfect expression," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a Gala evening at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Count of Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was unclean; the time leaves no traces to him."
And this says a princess...
The world's most difficult profession: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, stone roads.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who deserve their lives by getting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island Java.
To that end, he must rise down to the ground of his crater every day, where the sulphur gas flowing from the earth is mounted in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones that can weigh up to 70 pounds, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the desolate paths of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that raises up to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rising at the shield speed, maintaining the balance and setting their steps carefully so that they do not break out and crash.
You know that every step can cost her life, as this happened to a French tourist who crashed on the bars of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen deserve 5 Eurocent for each kilogram of sulphur they degrade.
Upstairs, they run the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus cups and run with the tired heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale, which a mine company has set a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which since 1960 has exploited the incidents in the volcano and (not better said) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupies (5 Eurocent) for each kilogram of sulphur.
This is because this mineral is widespread every day and is used for the manufacture of wooden oils, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamites and even for the bleach of sugar.
"Because we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 Rupia (3,8 euro) for each route," Anto explains to us, who usually makes three routes a day.
For each route, he takes three hours to complete, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 Rupia (11,5 Euro) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a very inhuman effort, but is the threefold of what he would deserve with the field work.
"The day-to-day son of mineworkers here, where the coffee harvest of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euro) is paid a day and the average monthly income is two million Rupia (167 Euro) is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a maur on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 Rupien (EUR 6.2) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and that for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing often, and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has played his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left the first traces with him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glass.
Anto has asthma, breathed with difficulty, caught frequently and his eyes are irritated from the volcano due to the toxic gases.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here for two years, because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but punished young man could work as a tourist leader, cellar or receiving a hotel, but instead, he performs the work of a tragedy.
He divides a dirty wooden cabin with other carriers and stands up at two o'clock every morning, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color is blue in darkness.
The shade challengingly, he rises in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money, into the crater.
Approximately 400 carriers are loading the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its great profits, the mine company has not mechanized sulphur degradation to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own accounts and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 Rupia (2.5 Euro) supplements per photo apparatus that the guards of this natural park, together with the entrance money of 15,000 Rupia (1.2 Euro), demand from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and human tragedy.
"This work is for the animals and not for humans" protests Madrusin, a steady 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving the school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he will continue, "as long as it goes," because he needs the money to raise his three children between 10 and 18 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and kilns the eyes when the wind suddenly turns and the miners stick into the thick pillars that rise from the scratch, the men are so hard that nobody complains about severe diseases ... of course except the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and blasing on the shoulders that have deformed themselves from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on his back, Unainik with its 53 years is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, transported by three trucks through a goat path between the bowl to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometers distance.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth wide, where some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder with his 30 years of age also works as sulphur sulphurs.
The time goes out, but the poverty holds generation on generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as a human burden on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporens blame for having no children, the career, the stress and the costs of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore has to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfill our civil obligation and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertising for Minzbonbons, but, yet - or just that reason - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local vocabulary such as "shaving will be a "bao" in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who has turned the video, retains the hope that the advertising spot reaches funny ways to draw attention to the problem.
Your creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfil their "national duty".
This is something just for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
In reproduction, we are the worst in the world, so we noticed that it is a topic that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried much, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromons or the organisation of speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Perhaps many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why don't we make something as creative as possible to deal with this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Whoever does not take this issue easy is the government of Singapore.
Every year, she spends $1,300 for political action to encourage citizens to get more children.
A package of government for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city state in southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its governments and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeners get any more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy of the national population authority, says that this is due to a "better education" and "greater career chances".
"This has made it possible for people to marry and form a family to have far more options in terms of life's goals and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of unemployed and to the delays of marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
At the same time, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the reduction of the population led to resentments in the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where the hardly casched Xenophobia blossoms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for keeping the wages low and not integrating themselves.
The increase in immigration is also considered to be one of the reasons why the Government Party in Singapore last year achieved its worst choice result since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected Effects
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on the economic growth of a nation, which has tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
This is how it already affects the housing market.
The City Development Authority has started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoes" and to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show great sales results.
However, there is anxiety that they can promote the lifestyle of the unemployed, and that they absurd the construction companies from building a large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoes" can be sold much faster than larger living units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger living units.
This causes them to be much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer directions to prevent obstacles in the past if they wanted to build too many small residential units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could lead to an increase in national birth rates, the conversations with the Singaporens working in the financial district should be considered that they will not have a significant effect.
"The people are strongly stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out from many," says a young manager.
The kids can get others.
"For me it's important to have my own money and time," another man, about twenty years old, says.
Men and women lead their career, stress and costs for property and education as a reason they cannot have children.
That is why the Singaporens have the last word when it comes to getting children - that the government can do so much.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private or "no area of private life, where you have the right to protect from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16 years old?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces if he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years, which are frequently on the network.
In four cases, they linked the term to "some very own" at personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't announce in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge trying to explain the importance of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know her, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I'll also spend my time with friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not from me, or of someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to write obstone photos, of naked ones, of crime, or insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assured to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Among them the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up with Twitter to express myself and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if someone answers me, I just let it up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly to relatives in the distance or to friends," he says.
He answered that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommends a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits that 20 of the people he has added his friends list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something wrong, for example, music," he admits.
According to the boy, no one made indications or asked him his address or phone number.
"If someone presses me or demands it from me, I simply remove it from my user account," he admits.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unknown experiences known today as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was pressed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never learned who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
Afterwards, he explains a series of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of friends in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he was unsympathic or I wanted to wipe him out one.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English with a graduate in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and youths, it is necessary to understand that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was a medium for searching for information; with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, the owner of a master title in education at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms for the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and youths who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants to teach them where we are learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we demand by them that they have a defined criterion about what should be spread, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be elective if it is most important for them to be popular to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and youths is to teach them what privacy is to ask them questions that bring them to thought.
"To tell you they shouldn't do it, it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then calls some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why then do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you like that you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question, do everyone have to know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they have to act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"Nobody outside the Internet is dealing with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and educational adviser, comments that it is essential that parents read carefully through the directives of social networks.
If they understand all sections, they have solid bases to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you may share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "Do not talk to strangers".
Finishing the Summit of the Unasury without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publishing the Declaration of Lima, which was announced earlier and theoretically signed by the seven present governments.
Ephe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI. ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Office first announced that they would transmit it after the clause, but after that, it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruvian Government.
In the case of questions on the text, they indicated that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was presented to the press in brief statements.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day, in the press room only the picture of the presidential meeting was transmitted with the message "Private Session, Limited Audio".
The few information circulated among journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the unasured governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which led to unpleasant discomfort for the hundreds of journalists of different national and international media that demanded more information.
Afterwards, the President of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the Declaration of Humala and not the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
Last October, Peru was hosts of the IIIth Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even at this occasion, despite the press's strong call, the so-called Lima declaration, which had been announced before, was published as little.
On the official website of the ASPA you can convince that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available for journalists, but to a high degree they limited access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Hague Court which attachs to a border conflict between two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would adopt the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday in Den Haag, in the process of introducing the Lima against Santiago to listen to both sides' plagues.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we are currently presenting to this international court," Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that is in line with international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, concludes agreements and is subject to international courtyards," adds Piñera and greets Humala with a hand pressure in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they would be subject to the IGH was made after Columbia, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, had raised a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
The Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner, were present at the summit.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after his President Fernando Lugo has been suspended, did not participate in the meeting.
The hosting President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The Head of State leaves the final document, which announced that 16 decisions were taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were defined by a total investment amount of 17 billion dollars.
To the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur will "act significant steps towards the aim of a South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He noted that measures would be driven to improve "cooperation in the fight against uncertainty in the cities and against organised cross-country crimes, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and to the Internet at low prices in all South Americas and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant moves, but should serve to expand our production performance and to show our people a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give a number of 31 emblematic projects priority to improve spatial relations in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and establish new economic forms," said the Peruian President in a readable statement.
Among these projects would also be five Peruvians on the cross-axles of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
Similarly, the final document referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its re-inclusion in the Union of South American nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourhood relationships was another aspect which was stressed at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before the start of his participation in the regional meeting, said that on Saturday in Mexico, he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict respectfully after a judgment of the IGH questioned by Bogotá.
"Maybe I'll meet with President Daniel Ortega on Saturday tomorrow," said Santos.
"We will check all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua makes discussions with Nicaragua necessary," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to say to the President Ortega that we will be as civilized and respectful as possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present in the office of the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the Block also met in advance to adopt the Action Plan for 2013, in which dialogue and consensus regarding the defence of the region should be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, even if the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, where "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that the Europeans were "on the second world war and in other confrontations" and "is practically a fatherland today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that promotes the Member States of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andes Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also welcomed the redesign of the organisation of American States (OES) under the requirement to reduce the influence of the Anglo Saxon States and to take into account those signed by the San José Agreement on Human Rights.
Those who teach are never obliged to do anything, and in contrast we always sign the South Americans everything.
"It is impossible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission has its seat in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as a reference to the political asylum that Ecuador granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but fulfilled his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that in his day there were "reasonable suspects that assange would be delivered to a third country and would not comply with his procedure."
He also criticised the Swedish justice which he requested to submit to him in his country for an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish judicial proceedings allow this through a video conference that could have been carried out via Ecuador's message in London."
Correa explained that the danger is that the health and psychological condition of Assange would be affected.
"Since he is in our message, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a light problem with the lungs, but not a serious thing," said Head of State of Ecuador.
It is, however, the risk that he can refer to physical and psychological damage because he is caught in a narrow space and cannot carry out physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution for the asylum, the Assange has been granted since June in Ecuador's embassy in London, is the granting of a free letter, with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the jurisdiction authorities of Europe. He stressed that there were talks with London to find a solution for the locked founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we do not apply this word for this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures on various European instances," he explained.
And "if the United Kingdom gives this free letter tomorrow, I think this is done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange on Ecuador's embassy in London or on Skype, how the Swedish law was allowed and made in other cases, the problem was over.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defense of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate, "the moderateness, the evil intentions and the lies that defend the freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of freedom of press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for gain and depress," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated that Ecuador no longer will be dominated by such journalists "and not be dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and spies citizen countries" and prevailed that he will "deepen the revolution to continue the way to this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the unasury at least until his next elections, arguing that "the organism must remain hard and no opportunism and no legally dressed state stroke" because it thus "was destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his columbian counterover, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Den Haag, which favoured Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between two countries, for "absolutely entitled."
This judgment is currently not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American State.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively to overcome them and look forward.
Similarly, he trusted in a good conclusion of the disputes on the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to call on international instances when both countries are obliged to adopt the judgment even if it is very tough."
As regards the possibility that he would be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to achieve his third mandate as a result, he said that he sees this option "with much optimism and joy, although it sometimes also falls very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but under as unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the one that guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as President, then I will withdraw from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"This is determined," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just talked to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he traveled for a planned routine treatment there and that he would expect to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It doesn't mean a relapse in the state of the health of President Chávez," he commented.
Today, the Ecuadorian Head of State attended in Lima at the 6th summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of the South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of a death for AIDS is a too late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the study result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit it," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "degrade without apparent success".
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such an effort that he was just celebrating his 43th birthday.
He is no doubt one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment possibilities and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of an IMSS clinic was missing to say goodbye, "because it led to a sackgasse."
At that time AIDS was synonymous for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic, who know nothing about their disease and who have already damaged the virus and exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is taking treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," explained the leader of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was supported by a viewed scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists concluded that AIDS was not a death condemn, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impaired immune system of persons at the start of treatment, and that those greater opportunities that are not drug dependent on: up to 30 years when counting 200 CD4 and 50 years when counting 500 CD4.
Simplifiedly, the above statements mean that whoever receives HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25, in this sense can become "problemless 75 years old as long as he is under control," this expert explained.
In order to correctly adjust this progress, it must be recalled that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even if death has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying in AIDS has decreased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA’s annual report)), it is still true that since the appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of patients included in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and until May this year, there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicinal products since 2005.
- So why are people still dying?
- I believe that the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is it in our hospital.
At least over the last 12 years, we had no supply problems in the medicines. The problem is that people are in a far advanced state because they do not know their infection status, i.e. in very late phases of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "New out of ten patients come to us if they already have a co-infectant infection. To influence global mortality, early diagnosis is necessary, so all people in which this is necessary need to be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal agrees with the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) and to the patients like Fabrizio, who were able to carry out his test at a private laboratory, and this for the only reason it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had the caposi-sarkom (a cancer-like tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they'll die, and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then rather place three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed myself well, drive sport and take the medicines.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anybody else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsible like all people.
His news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the shop table
Between the health programmes and the simple citizen, Ricardo Salazar explains, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the issue of HIV.
And the most important is the prevention.
At the specific places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
The risks of new infections include young people.
"Why do you need this?" is a widespread question of social workers, orientation staff in schools, pharmaceuticals and healthcare professionals who do not want to be exposed to young people insured the correspondent.
He suggested that this inefficient distribution be reoriented; the condoms should be located not only behind the shop table, but in public toilet equipment of facilities frequently visited by young people.
It should not be promoted by promiskuity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González answered the question whether it would be reserved under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who already exercise a sexual activity," he pointed it.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is nationally seen at the fourth place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and 13 in relation to HIV.
92% of seizures occur in sex, 6% in blood and 2% in perinatal.
It is estimated that 500,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know for each registered case.
After the United States Court of Appeal has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructuring of the commitments of the Vitro Group, which have been reached through a trade bank in Mexico, an unhealthful precedent will be created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country with payment problems.
So it could be said that the procedures for survival of companies allowing the Mexican laws have no validity in the country of stars and stripes in contradictory to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale at the Court of Bancarrotas for the northern District of Texas on 15 June leads the Mexican companies to be exposed to their possession outside the Bravo River without help.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico's door and gate to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge pointed out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, seated in New Orleans, first states that the main procedure is the trade bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for incapacity of payment companies with cross-country profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law was created for the harmonization of international trade law, with the American Law Institute as a lighter.
Secondly, the judgment that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass of the branches of Vitro with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
Actually, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose obligations were confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstitut für Handelskonkurse).
In addition, after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro at the United States courts, i.e. the Geier-Fonds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37 per cent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there is Vitro guilty of his difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country hit.
For this reason, the González Sada family contradicts the same court of appeal in order to vote in plenary, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them voted.
If it is not made, the cerciorare objection which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher instance shall be invoked by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing in this case is that the court left a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro in the framework of the law on trade bankruptcy, and pointing out that it had been strictly attached to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with the chapter 15 of the United States Concurrence Act.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has subjected to the principles of international trade by the United Nations Commission, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border payment incapacities guaranteeing equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambole: a struggle for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the advertising by the Mexican Air Traffic Federations against the former owners of Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, several months ago, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Focus of Pilots) finally made progress.
The application referred to by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now submitted a criminal procedure against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is proposed to a disability of justice.
After that, the Supervisory Authority has systematically refused to inform the Republic’s main administration of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from the trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE from the name of Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administrative Profesional de Hoteles (professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
A group of national and foreign environmental protectors, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a broad front in order to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country outside the wall, supplemented to a living area for the staff of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of the manufacturing industry) has reached to unite the governors in the south-east in order to resist the monumental establishment, which partly destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of the Senate's request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassadors in Japan signed the anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation of ACTA, has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Occupation.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had excluded the possibility because he viewed them as infringements of the freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In striving to pay long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex carriage certificates brings over 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four same emissions that promise a interest payment every 28 days.
Creation of Competition
Formed by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leading companies of information technology, a company group was founded under the name Competival, whose objective is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, "Basketball was my life"
The world bummler of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sports for over 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have a so great spiritual collection of the history of the basketball of the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound by a stroke in 2008 to the wheelchair, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, agent and leader of the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"I have set a lot of hats in basketball for my life, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, head of the National Team and President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled when visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated and witnessed with photos and memories of his long career.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional reminders are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 1950s as players until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as a co-operative or manager of the club.
"There were my best years I've enjoyed most, because I have been allowed to be part of eight masterships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as manager, cooperative manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships together from 1971 to 1975.
And then I adopted myself with a mastership in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very powerful and 2 m large player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free-roll specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizenship and was one of our best advertisers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a mastership for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already out of a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he planned to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first won the pre-olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then, in 1990, the World Championship, where we occupied the fourth place, what actually should have been bronze if not this Canadian arbitrator, who let us repeat the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of world championship in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It belongs to the best, as well as to those who won against the Dream Team at the Olympia 2004.
My favorite is, however, the team of the pan-American games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a battle to the United States team, as at the time when they won against us at the world championship of Bronze.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were there again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be present in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team, which may not have been the best in terms of personality, but with which we won a gold medal and made us great joy, was those of the pre-olympic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitin as a replacement for the locked players because of the incidents on the Pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
Its figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated as Piculín at this level.
And this, without taking into account his career in the various ligs in which he played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else will you do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet in the national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the required training and courses for trainers, table officials and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and sometimes go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy the society of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the "Dallas" series of televisions, where he played a creepy, mysterious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new set of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., Producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his loved birth town Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he liked most," the family said.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebration of the harvest thanks.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
He joyed all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was a original person and lived life in full moves," Gray explained in a message.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over years.
In 1995 a malicious tumor was detected in his liver and he was subject to a transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known as a nice guy in the TV in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Wonderful Jeannie" at the NBC TV.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he hit an attractive "Dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live at his home.
He was also a shower of two commodities, which were released only a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema work included the roles of the criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the magnificent awesome J.R. who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain through the Ewing-Clan and other figures in its surroundings was radiated from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot on J.R.?", the expectation for a episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in competition houses.
So the series reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer was published in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average 41 million viewers who converted "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who had sweared by J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had swallowed her and threatened to represent her as prostitutes if she didn't leave the city. But others also had reasons to want him to be dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, unsatisfactory man with a charismatic smile: a deceived businessman and unfaithful husband who strived to give his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on the grave stone of J.R.," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here is the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, co-presentative of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "enormous personality up and out of the screen".
He is unforgettable and unrestorable for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts to keep us who have the happiness of knowing him and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months ago with great success in the TNT TV channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second pile was completed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, informed the transmitter.
By Warner or by TNT there was no immediate explanation on how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress Mary Martin, who played classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was another youth when she got Larry with lawyer Ben Hagman during her marriage.
He tried his luck on the theater stages in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, afterwards he served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The pair had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many familiarities have their residence.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I haven't written anything about which I thought it could hurt someone or interfere with him in any wise way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After he was heavily transplanted for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxiety patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are before and after it," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable for the first time, but it'll be good for you."
He also engaged in smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of courses studying the "Ende of the World"
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and cheime and global warming.
Every semester, when the religious professor decided to hold a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an inconsistent fishing hook: the end of the "long back counting" of the Maya calendar on December 21, of which many people believed it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the following two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict with Israel's participation, the place of which Christian theoretics believe that the Apokalypse begins.
"I haven't noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé said this week to students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what happened today in the world as if we were 30 days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers this semester, which should actually be the last in history, courses about the "end of the world".
In Temple, the assistant professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and cheime and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread with time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month the students analysed films with apocalyptic content and studied how they were compared to real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a consecutive professor of art history and anthropology, set up a team to offer a course with the simple name "The End of the World".
"We don't take up in 2012 so that we can always keep the option to retain the course in case the world is not undergoing," Restall said.
Despite the "presentation" the students need to study, create projects and participate in audits.
In Penn State, the graduation test is carried out in the evening of the Apokalypse, which is why students have no other chance than "to continue working until the night where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," Restall said about his course for students with a high average filled with 35 students.
We received e-mails from students who asked if there were still places free.
The students of their part assure that the course is among the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a question of comfort or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Healthcare declared that he had seen all apocalyptic films.
"Never heard of a lesson where this is being taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students asked - and less a professor - said to believe in the last date of December 21st.
"Our first project discussed the Mayas' prophecy, and in certain ways we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in the Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that results from centuries when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Otherly, people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who this year teaches the Philippines, answers quickly to the question whether he would know a course about the "End of the World" there.
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an indication of an exception to a higher instance.
We have a resentment from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that many days had been spoken by the last court over the years, and said that if on December 21th nothing happens, "the people immediately think of a new date" or philosophy that the 21st December was the beginning of a seven-year period, from which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easy.
Several people said they wanted to celebrate "the end of the world".
"I may call a few friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
