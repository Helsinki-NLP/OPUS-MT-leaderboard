I am #PRS_ORG# and therefore it's no problem for me.
Just need a number or instructions that I should attach to the package so that it can be pulled as a retoure.
I ordered #PRS_ORG# for 249€ a few days ago.
Today it costs 179€.
I really think that is very angry.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another possibility of credit?
I think, in principle, that children should not be allowed to take a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I find it good for big sisters to take care of the little ones too.
Let's look a little, help me, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can be enough children, I can't see any problem.
If your K1 is busy for the short time alone and it's okay for him, that's good.
You can best measure yourself whether this suits your children.
It's not like he's going to wick K2 and accompany him for hours while sleeping.
Just legally, it is probably questionable.
Therefore, perhaps the statement of psychologists also comes.
Because if something really should happen like a fire, invasion, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk that you want to take is of course your measure;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a Crime / Thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole action but I don't want to interfere with the title partout maybe someone here knows...
The story was of fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, an animal career kills himself by shaking with feed and walking into his robbery cats.
The case is taken by a Commissioner who, after exploring his therapeuts, operates a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The Commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (for fire) and lands with this therapeut.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is responsible anonymously before every suicide to go and document the place of suicide and put the photos on the Internet.
In any event, it turns out that this therapeut operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient plants a chip that is underpressed in the brain and the patients eventually put themselves in the extreme way in their fear.
(a woman jumps out of the window another rides with intention to die)
This is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the gross act I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author / author.
If this act is known to someone or even someone can betray me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh, ever, I don't have the password available for Wlan.
I need to contact my husband first.
But it can take a while.
What steps do I have to do after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference rejected ?
child, 4 j., splitter under the thumb nail
Child, four years, has over the entire length of wood splitter under the thumb nail (outside).
Have tried to pull him with a pinzette.
Very hard to grab.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child responds hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow, it's going to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a ladder plate, we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in nearly every gate of the H0 and 0 tracks.
LokSound 5 Decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large “sugar cubic” speaker next sound cap set.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a real multi-protocol decoder.
It controls the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as obvious as 2 and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders are logging in to a suitable digital centre.
It controls all DCC programming modes and, thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main glazing can be read with appropriate centrals.
For centrals that can only programme the CVs of 1-255 exist help registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three other Motorola® addresses allow the trigger of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also enables reprogramming with the honorable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows an automatic login to mfx®-compatible centrals.
The LokSound 5 Decoder recognizes the marklin® brake lines as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
The brake with DCC brake blocks or with equal voltage is also possible.
In addition, he also stops at a selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC pendle train automatic allows automatic pendle between two train stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue equal and inter-stream paths.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to promote refreshment stimulation
New Omicron cases always bring politics and science in Britain.
Therefore, until the new year, all qualifying adults in England are to receive a vaccine offer.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to progress even faster in the Corona refresh vaccinations in the face of rapidly increasing omicron numbers than has been sought.
Each adult in England was supposed to have the opportunity to receive a Booster dose until the end of the year, provided that there have been at least three months since the second vaccination, Johnson said to his country's people on Sunday evening in a pre-signed video message.
To date, the target date was at the end of January.
The British Government will provide additional support in order to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the countries of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omicron variant, one is faced with an emergency, so urgently the protection of vaccines needs to be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let you boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omicron cases were registered in Great Britain, with a total increase of 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
is the full amount refunded from the purchase price when picking up?
I am for everyone imagining with pronomen
I sent off an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation via e-mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I've googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can anyone help me?
** I am a foreigner and I do not want any officials to go over the feet either.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine with pronomen.
Totally 5 books on it.
4 of them.
Only the one I bought today is not going to
Apparently, the chair had an unclear lack of sales.
How else can such a polster damage occur after 9 months ?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's been working since about.
14 days no more.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and I wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to add 2 chairs to order and bill it to me.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write some detail about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
For professional reasons I am more frequently in contact with the victims (and actors) of domestic violence.
A topic that really nakes to me and unfortunately much too often occurs is that many victims are not allowed to help or think we couldn't help them.
I'm quite clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the acter far out of sight and hearing I can't reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it's fear to fear of vengeance, to leave the usual social environment, to scare the children out of this.
What I always want to make everybody clear is partly very close to the tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this never makes it easier.
Please, keep in mind that you are worth living without violence, that's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series do to "League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game university, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two pillars already announced?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Younger Johannes Patrick was left.
Again nothing: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's trainer John Patrick had said, "We have some anger in the abdominal."
But after the game, it did not lay down - but again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) downlay in the basketball-Bundesliga.
More than the naked result disappointed the way it appeared.
As vice-president, is a statistics that expresses the entire dilemma: The three quotas were just 13 percent, 4 hits (all of the young John Patrick) in saying and write 31 trials - any questions?
John Patrick answered: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Teneriffa, and did not implement what we trained."
To move the ball.
Otherwise his counter to Sebastian Gleim reacted: "A great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10 000 people ago."
On Saturday in the Hohenlohe-Arena, only 750 visitors were authorised, but they came at their expense.
Not least also because of BBL topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and guided the game of his team.
"The best game maker I've ever trained," praised Glem.
While in Patrick's team, the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debakel and came up to eight points after they had already returned 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon came on twelve points.
Fortunately, a lot of time for hating does not remain.
Already on Wednesday (19:00) the Riesen receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then in Ludwigsburg, a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address before, but I changed it.
Yeah, I've already reported myself a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all guarantee claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed and have resigned to them.
We originally reported ourselves a year and a half ago.
Always picked out of the egg: Max Raabe becomes 59
He can enthusiasm his audience with new interpretations of battle from the 20s and the 30s.
He is currently on his way with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he may occur.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But there's nothing from it.
The planned concert was transferred in May 2022 - "instructed by the authority" to prevent the corona virus.
Other appearances planned in the advent time have to be found only once, as it is stated on the website of the singer, which is now being 59, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January then the artists want to retrieve their dates already posted in 2020 due to the pandemics.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-West Falish lies, Max Raabe has already sung a lot and loved to sing as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opern songs, and in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with Kommilitons.
Since then, the bariton has established itself with its stock of battle and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was often awarded with prices.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of charts, just like his success album "For women is this no problem" (2013).
He made it from the nose into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair came back strictly and thought of labels, Max Raabe is no longer going to think away from the current German-speaking musical landscape.
With the program "Good day, luck" he's been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small pattern piece of the furniture?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check in advance whether it fits colourfully
It still doesn't work I can only desire the cover sheet but not leave.
Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by disappointment
The new Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the disappointment of large housing companies, as it was demanded in a public decision in Berlin.
"With an intention, there is no single new apartment, it only changes the owner's structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "day level" (Sunday).
My goal is to give renters security that their rent remains payable in the next years.
A bunter mix of, for example, private rentals, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly education.
In Berlin, the Coalition from SPD, Green and Left Party wants to use an expert Commission as to how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not exclude conversations with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further sharpness in the rent law.
The coalition contract provides for a rental price brake by 2029, a limitation of rental increases in tense housing markets and the extension of the rental level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something, and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step in payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be stocked again?
Or if it'll come again at all?
#PRS_ORG# with space (180 x #NUMBER#cm),
Good news sounds super
Then I'll trigger it independently at the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
When the lamp is sent in March, how long will the shipment take?

This is an absolute frequency
At least 100 deaths by Tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous towers have been moved through the United States.
The only one in Kentucky could be to complain more than 100 dead.
The pictures from there remember a war area.
In the evening on Saturday, several tornados in the United States have destroyed seriously and possibly demanded up to a hundred death victims.
The storms leave a 320 kilometres long cut of destruction, especially in Kentucky.
This governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the Tornado was passed, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that it is at all possible.
He counts alone in the member state of Kentucky with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rise in an hour.
Hello, I just saw her was sold out Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is she still being produced?
Or is she taken from the range?
Is there the possibility to order this vitrine in another country?
Until when are you reporting?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, can I just order the ceiling now and let it be delivered to Germany, which is in the cart?
I had returned or resigned a article via the contact form and wanted to ask if it was received or edited, since I had not received a confirmation yet.
Enterprises pay vaccine premiums and change advertising
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are thus on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Economic Chamber, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising logans to vaccination - according to German example - will also increase the willingness to Corona vaccinations.
He's changed to a company about which he lasered.
It doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year ago.
He has obviously not attached himself to his old place and has been looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at that time: no matter what.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.
I'll make a screenshot.

Assistance in the first own campaign
Boron to the barbecue!
I just direct the adventure About the grip pass and want to lead my heroes to a special campaign written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the evil weights and their motivations are written, the individual act is thought out, and now I am writing the entrance adventure and stealing over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a feuer with cereals from Gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran Sea.
There is to develop the further action.
A few miles away from the village, the heroes are to lean up a group of Goblins and attract them to a rear.
I would like to give the players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, threats, recognising the danger early, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spices, 6 armed with bows and seals
When not noticed, the Goblins loud up the heroes in a holeway and flank to each of three left and right of me bows armed the fireworks, while two with spies stop the fireworks.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are subject to, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are found and healed by the son of the village school, half-elve.
Of course, the car is gone.
2. Should a defeat be indispensable, just this half-elf come in with two of his servants and come to the heroes in the battle for help.
The car is still there. Everything great.
How appropriate do you hold Deus ex Machina from solution 2?
Is the encounter as an entrance to the adventure too much?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so not only canon feed.
EDIT: wow, I hadn't expected so many answers, especially with so many great proposals and tips.
I will guarantee you to take care of many of your ideas and have more confidence in my narrative now.
I reconstructed the lamp.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway.
If you can then let the back tickets come, then I can pack the lamp and bring to #PRS_ORG#.

Will everything then be picked up again or just the vacuum part?
I am generated by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1-Fans, over the season, the quality on the German sky has been increasingly decreasing, so I want to make a little air with this post.
The transfer was first cancelled in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-reporting periodically.
Although the delayed start and the start accident of the schedule had been far behind the planning, the last (planned) ten minutes and the mastership decision (!) could still have been shown.
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 has priority and therefore has to restrict everything else, so Sky DE has probably no choice here.
Yet stupid, especially as Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Schwarztyes has well accompanied the difficult situation about the serious accident.
Then, in the F1, there was regulator accident again with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both didn't know that you could switch the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation was already in Imola, Baku and Silvertone this year, both came to the conclusion that steps may change the tyres when there were corresponding radio talks on this topic at Hamilton.
With Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this option for stabs.
I believe that such elementary rules should be easily known when you comment on the F1 in a pay-TV broadcaster.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or required by rules, both have simply constant uncertainties in the field of rules.
Generally not liked with the artificial comment style of Roos, but give that the taste is case.
But there I really like Heiko water from RTL better.
Continuous albernities, which both simply act unprofessionally, such as the ordering of coffee at (also unconceived) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the last one brings a lot of disturbance into the comment that he does not seem to take this seriously.
Not least, the advertising simply takes overhand at Sky, in the outlet round, Sky is the only transmitter that goes into the advertising, as you can listen to at F1TV there only the German sound track without comment must come out directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two broadcasters also make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as free TV broadcaster.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The other program by Sky Sport F1 is also very dreadful and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaker who transfers the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes a better job at the four races that they may still transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On this: #PRS_ORG# Pendle Light, Messing and Multicolor glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing yet.
The First Lady told me it's sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she'll check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the substance has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent to provide an aquarium with oxygen in addition.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifts.
This series is offered in 3 variants of us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole installations with it.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps are suitable with 2 or more exits to connect to more outflowers.
The MK series has one, two or four exits, depending on the model ventilator pump, but also offers to put an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air cover (see with us in the shop) or with a decor that turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure rest, muggle or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound damped construction and thus provides low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The ventilator pump is connected 4/6 mm to an Auströmer, etc. and can already go.
The atmospheric pump should be equal to or higher as the water level and should be applied outside.
If the ventilator pump is deeper than the water level, you should put a backtrace valve between it.
Just cut through the air hose and put the valve between it.
This would prevent when water runs backwards that the water runs out of the pool through the pump...
If the atmospheric pump is put outside, you should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume low energy
Even if we specify the processing time in ebay with 3 days, then the packages are packed daily and the packages are also downloaded here daily.
If everything goes well on the road, it's going very fast.
We just want to prevent a little, so that no one is wrong, just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the field of expedition... of course here does not hold Corona.
Please do not evaluate as bad only because the delivery is delayed, which is exclusively related to the package services.
Of course, you like to shrink about these services, even if we say at the moment,... they have it fucking hard.
This is also very different regionally.
If you don't be evil to anyone, you stay healthy and we all hope that there are better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellows with and without arms?
Can you order your legs in bright?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and Moderator to the world
The daughter of the first U.S. American in the All, a TV-Moderator and four more passengers have undertaken a short trip into space.
On Saturday, they were transported by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the Blue Origin company by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the 10-minute flight took place in the west of Texas.
Bezos took most personally the freshly cut astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the hole to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds on their way and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa Astronauts to Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named the Rakete System of Blue Origin, and the 50-year TV-moder Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company who had paid the other four passengers for their tickets: space travel engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Besss and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket each, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father after the short flight.
He has worked hard in his efforts and has to do everything himself.
She just fled like that, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his excitement.
He would like to return to all right now, said the Moderator.
"New Shepard" flights up to 100 kilometres
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, at times with severity before the reusable object was re-braked from large fallscreens.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third man-made all-excursion of Blue Origin: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutch.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actress William Shatner was present with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the vice-president of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics suggest Bezos and Blue Origin to promote business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of mankind and without respect for climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I'm currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and actually find the field quite exciting in itself and even in the lab isn't disturbing me (has already the anorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I have already informed myself about professional prospects before studying, but at the time I also thought that I would definitely want to study until the promotion and will.
But at the moment I have doubts, especially depressing me the prospects of employment.
On the one side (study check etc) you always hear super occupational opportunities and the occupation is totally searched, on the other side you hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested:
1) As what do you work at present?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am at the moment really uncertain and may interrupt the study in 2022 and make a training expert.
If you have experiences there, they also like to write times :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays
This topic came up to me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why you're not going to have a foster.
Not only before large holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
It seems that there's the one before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week, Mariä went to the sky, which is called "road" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long 4-day week night in the house.
So what happened last week?
Everywhere, stress.
According to e-mails, which were essentially required to get out before the trip, order here, everything *unconditioned* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because "Next week" then sounds after so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people want to earnestly afford as much in a shortened week as in a normal?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also powerfully generated.
What's this self-gift for holidays?
Why do we then have holidays if we are not allowed to enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from the top, the colleagues were all very independently.
My question is simple: Are we only like that, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evident way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Caterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Caterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thüringish home - but has no gifts yet.
"The beauty, even if there should not be snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the festival by backing and bastling with her son.
"I love that," said Caterfeld.
But until the sensible days, she has some things to do: "For the first time I have no gifts, I have to go now finally."

Unfortunately still not working
DDR-Handwerksmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the Lok was in use in Schlesien and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive is likely from the reconstruction suggestion of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with game tracks and missing parts see photos, function good, the construction series E 95 is a heavy freight train electric comotive of the German railway company (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal grain trains in the Spanish network, possibly the construction rate also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Salee) and we operated
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had ordered the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive which should be able to transport on this route 2,200-tonn coal trains and 530-tonne passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h.
As a maximum speed, 65 km/h were required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as 1Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-suckerwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives received E 95 01-06 were delivered.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves again on the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived as repairs in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the R & D, Theseu was found the workworthiness of all six locomotives.
[4] In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed, with the remaining machines as a spare part donor.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 were preferred.
The E 95 focused on the development only when E 94 had been seen that the number of developments could not be further increased.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed at Leipzig-Wahrs.
They arrived in 1960 at Halle P.
They were used in their own circuit plan mostly before coal trains from the hostel valley towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematicly, with increasing age, the complicated control of locomotives proved to be complicated.
Thus, it was more often that protector remained sticking in switching operations.
Then the co-oper with hammer and wooden chill on this locomotive had to re-evaluate the shooter during the journey.
The damage to the driving engines occurred more frequently and led to monthly failures at the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new engine locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could leave old locomotives and most splitting gates, so that E 95 was excluded.
In addition, they found that the German Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electrolocomotives only one-manly, which would have resulted in a problem in the train operation due to the difficulties with the machinery and view conditions mentioned.
[5] After mid-1969 the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were disposed of, they were last followed by the E 95 01, which discontinued the service on 5 October 1970.
The new name set out to be 255 001 was therefore not used.
Until the E 95 02 all locomotives were broken.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heater at the Halle main station.
It took some time to convince the officers at the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was worth the museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external development of locomotives began with the aim of presenting them to a vehicle view in the RAW Theseu.
[5] Since then it was part of the Dresden Transport Museum as an unemployed museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotives took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive museum is maintained.
Since 1995, staff of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational development of locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time to an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external lacquering, with the transformators being checked and five driving engines operated.
-The locomotives were in use on the Slesian Mountain Trail until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Mediterranean network.
The main operation area was first Schlesien
Manufacturing model H0 in OVP, function well, it is necessary optical reworking at the locomotive in self-work, dusted, with game traces, cellar odour !!!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition- possibly the construction is also from the small series company SCHUSSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can contain labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-Parts are it
I got a bed from you.
However, there were some problems.
The middle bar is held by two feet..liders are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, these are unfortunately misproduced.
The centre bar does not fit into the intended holding.
So I'll be sent to new ones.
When are they sent out?
No flakes.
That's, according to the assembly instructions the right of the shape, they were only too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
Main case they fulfil their purpose
With me they're not flat
Can I get these to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
House fire with two injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured at a fire in a living house in Upper Bayern.
Furthermore, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire was probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two inhabitants were reported to be brought to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisons.
The exact cause of fire was not known at first, but the police did not go out of a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it comes a lot later.

To eliminate Fake News - Biontech CEO published vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published on the social network "LinkedIn" a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021
Biontech-Chef Uğur Şahin has not been public about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The sickness of a friend moved him to share it.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainzer Company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, have published a photo that shows how to receive a vaccination against the corona virus.
In social media there were false information that I was supposed to be not vaccinated.
Actually, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post in the "LinkedIn" network.
"From a few months, friends have pressed me to post a photo of me on which I have been vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this because communication shouldn't turn around him.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply distressed when I learned that an old school friend of me is currently fighting for his life.
He fights against a severe Covid 19 disease and has been hanging on a respiratory device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often caused by misinformation and mistrust."
Frightening is difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In the Internet, an interview is circulating with the German wave, where Uğur Şahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German wave himself clarified.
"I am currently not allowed to get the vaccine itself," said Şahin at that time.
There is a priority in Germany in the vaccination of vaccination.
In the meantime, the priorization has been suspended for a long time - and the Biontech Chief has been vaccinated three times, according to appropriate information.
Fire in circulation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light came out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating.
A fire had lamed a circuit station.
After a fire with severe damage in a circuit station, tens of thousands of people have had to get out of the Rhine Victory Cruise in North Rhine-Westphalia for about 24 hours without electricity.
During the fire on Friday evening, 41,000 inhabitants and inhabitants in several communities were affected.
The Provider West Network reported that on Saturday, many emergency power aggregates had been in operation until the major disturbance was finally completely corrected in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked the people concerned for their patience and helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the firearms and the THW for the inevitable use," said the leader of the primary technology, Florian Witt, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take some days, since the West Network mounters could only take some lines in operation provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company statements.
Power flows again
The fire broke out on Friday at 19.15 p.m., according to the information made by the West Network at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid circuit station, has severely damaged parts of the 10.000 volt scale.
There is a need for exhaustive cleaning and repair work.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 volt volt volt level was established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply remains.
Since Saturday 18 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had returned electricity.
Other 20 000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 p.m., the last ones concerned would also have power.
More than 80 assemblies from West Network and Partner Companies had been in use.
After the construction of an emergency supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"Now it is important that citizens in their neighborhood take care of older or alone people and inform local firearmhouses when help is needed," explained Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In setting up and operating emergency power aggregates, the inhabitants of Oldenheimen were focused.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care facilities were established in schools for those who could not provide themselves or need power-dependent medical devices or are required for medical care.

We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
We have 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't put it together and thus shorten it.
Can you keep helping me there?
Otherwise, I would have to send her back, because otherwise she is not suitable for the purpose.
I'd be pleased with a reply
Yes, that's really easier!
Let's do it like that!
Do you send me the back certificate by mail?
the repair is now completed.
I had tried this before the chat.
However, before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I feel that low credit is almost ashamed.
We do not agree with this.

In order to be even and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, wash and dry with clear water.
Before bringing the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 stripes.
You can do this on the later unvisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Draw the brush evenly stroke next to the stroke.
Light overlap of the color layers will later provide a even area.
Avoid swimming quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealisticly active areas.
A model is not a garden tail.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could look through later.
Metal tones and metalic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, when mixed with normal colors, it may cause unpleasant metal closures.
Let the painted parts dry one day before you grow them.
Originally reliable appearance reaches the models through the Decals or subtractions.
From high-speed marks on aircraft through ship names to ceramic bars and labels for car models: The Decals give the model the last sliff.
Bring the decals in the right order as long as the components are still good to reach.
A plane cockpit can be dressed or lighter before it is built in the rump.
Even more important than the right tool, such as sharp, pinset and toothsticks, are time, patience and a calm hand.
Cut each required decal out individually and put it up to you.
Decals is also called water slide images, because you're shortly moisturizing their back with water until the carrier paper becomes dark by the nose.
Then you just slide the picture a small piece of paper and put the piece to the corresponding place on the model (which you have already fainted).
While you hold the Decal on the model with a tool, you remove the carrier paper on the side.
Attention: Always check whether the picture is right before you slide it completely out of the paper, so that it doesn't stick, knick or even scratch.

Respect is not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book shortly as soon as I look at something else then I no longer read the book and I have to log out and log in and reload the book and find the place where I read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 separate packages
Thank you very much, too!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money's back.
Do I get this back without problems?
Children's wish treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We were a few times in child wish treatment, now that it is about the settlement with the PKV, it suddenly turns over.
The row after:
We had applied for the children's disturbance in front of the PKV and received the promise of 3 attempts.
The trials were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and did 2 (successless) attempts, but they did not yet calculate with the PKV.
We again asked for the acquisition of costs at the PKV and received 3 further attempts again.
After some further attempts (we have done more trials than promised, logically calculate the most expensive with the PKV) we have received the invoices at the PKV and received the bad surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PKV wants to substitute only 3 attempts.
Reason: With pregnancy/born, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise decline.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
However, according to the AGB, "The insurance case begins with healing treatment, it ends when treatment need no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to substitute the PKV (only 3 trials) or we (there are 5 attempts to substitute)?
* Had the PKV had to point out in the commitments that with a birth, the further attempts have expired?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (conditioned by closed ovarians) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give you your opinion.
Thank you for your help!
Can you send me the three variants by email and tell me how I am best to reach them again?
All right.
We're not gonna order anything from them anymore.
If they add the transactions of me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they obviously lost a good customer.
They'd like to pass that on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the reimbursement was caused and now tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can do anything for the commodity completely disturbing me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear and clear that the reimbursement has been caused and I have not yet received a repayment by #PRS_ORG#
You can tell their manager that they have now lost two tribal customers.
My friend also ordered several furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
A office chair must endure normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as a office chair.
In any case, the guarantee of 24 months shall apply.
No, it's not possible for me to get another type of packaging.
I'm going to cut off the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
Purchases will be these products with additionally purchased hockers, but we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best Low Budget movies
What a Low-Budget film is precisely, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget film** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major movie studio or private investor.
In the network you can find plenty of lists of Low-Budget movies, such as zB on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's up with you?
And what do you may not like at all?
I'm a very good customer of you, has already set up two apartments completely with your furniture.
I wanted to ask the best price for the grey Ledersofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now trustworthy?
Thank you.
With friendly greetings
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately nothing changes at the waiting position... I'll then give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory" to the policy expert Raphael Bossong.
But the costs were very high and meant massive infringements of the rights of migrants and refugees to Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong of the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainablely, the EU has not solved the confrontation, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This sweeping condition - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels to be a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
Treatment with people at the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong sentenced.
It seems that there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole does not reconcile then, this is at the cost of fundamental rights.
This development simultaneously weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it is unable to survive when a Member State is in the head of making his thing," as the current Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex to reach the border.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, so Bossong: a principle agreement on asylum policy will be difficult because the line "Grensschutz, Border Protection, Border Protection" has been strengthened.
Reimbursement of cross-border efforts
According to Poland’s border protection, migrants have again tried to reach Belarus in Polish.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday in the night and returned to the border, said a speaker of the Authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been entrusted with stones in the incident near Czeremsza by the immigrants.
According to the information, a soldier was struck in the face and had to be cared for medical care by a military doctor.
Totally, the border protection recorded 52 attempted cross-border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU over the past few months.
The EU insists Alexander Lukaschenko as a powerholder in Minsk to attract them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to border sections, Poland and Lithuania have affixed press reports.
The EU sanctified Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to the countries of origin to stop departure there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"Then the EU has thrown its market power into the scale and proved its determination to operate with hard bandays and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account internal policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not concerned that the security apparatus regularly swallows thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial formula 1-finale
Max Verstappen believes that Mercedes has committed two fractures during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial formula 1-finale of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has protested.
The silver arrows are likely to be equal to two fractions of the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an assuming infringement of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety-car phase when he should have overcome regularly.
A second objection was raised against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
On the last round of Lewis Hamilton in Mercedes, the steps had been overwhelmed and had come to his first formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Netherlands had overturned the car riding in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again
Thank you for support

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semit, it doesn't mean anything.
It's like if a dealer says he doesn't have anything to do with foreigners.
It will not both confess their i.
But collegah constantly reproduces any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distinguish you should just leave this complete.
Yes, where then you will not take seriously as colleague.
Whoever seriously questions evolution is simply totally lost.
For my sake, a God has put it all in place.
But as soon as you're a creative, you have to believe that the earth is 100,000 years old and science is only causing foolishness.
And so you're a science enemy and not to take seriously like colleague
In order to obtain an optimum view field, the lupe should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic-designed lens system allows you to use the lupe into the edge zone with practical forgiveness and colourless error.
Frequently, lupes are marked with enlargement.
However, these data only apply to precise conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to be able to use your lupe optimally, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical Data" (see package instructions).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - also in the case of tape lups - light reflections arise.
These mirrors are significantly reduced by an anti-reflection coating.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
For further information, see the accompanying instructions for use (in German and English).

Tand sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz Women are looking for Christmas trees
Agricultural Frank Diers has experienced a lot of courageous situations during the sale of teeth.
Once, a man should have gone home without his partner because both of them could not agree.
Every year he plants well 2000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some courageous situations.
That always makes the past night time a little funny, he says.
What about that with the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
Anyway, I have received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled at a spinning spider.
And then both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be like the "Dreher", which does not much sound so delicious.
Problems with glass fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I have problems with building a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit correctly up to a few failures.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the Wi-Fi, no longer reaches the full 500, but the further I get away from the house with the module, the less then the less arrives (i.e. use a dosage that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other module).
This causes the Internet with the new glass fiber connection to the first floor to be even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set that seems to be using a new technology.
Although this was easily better than the DLan, there were similar losses.
Could someone explain to me why with glass fibres so much Internet speed over the power line " lose"?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely exciting to move in the house LAN cable.
I'm really desperate, why I made an extra account here.
That's why I'd be more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change the Giro account
Who would have thought that it would be the first time to rest with the giro accounts, looks fake.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the fee increases in the past by their customers with all kinds of tricks, the free amounts for negative interests are still lowering.
For example, the German Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of EUR 100 000 for a long period of time.
Now she just half the free amount and even celebrate for day money.
In one first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group-Partee Postbank - to EUR 50.000 in Giro and Investment Accounts and to EUR 25.000 for day money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower free amounts apply to the entire German Bank, as a speaker confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with stock customers".
The Commerce Bank had already gone down to a limit of EUR 50.000, which is still in force, as was the ING Germany.
The DKB has just been a popular DKB in cost-conscious customers and has reduced the free amounts to two stages, first to EUR 50,000, and now to EUR 25,000.
Indeed, more than 100 banks have a free amount of EUR 25,000 or less according to the numbers of the Verivox Internet portal.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at EUR 25,000: however, there is still a legal debate with the consumer centres, which have even received right in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
Now, the banks are discussed whether the institutions may have to form return - in the case that the upper instances also have to explain the negative interests in principle for inadmissible and pay back millions to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston occupies a whole beauty army
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley trip.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected by the US Magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For them, who made the "friends" reconciliation in 2021 and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" Furore, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
Their appearance cares for a whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers.
Indeed, Aniston, she will enjoy a chip on the day (yes, correctly read: a EINZIGEN chip out of the bag).
The fact that you fly to the hearts of the female and male fans is a miracle.
Maybe because she's just having fun with happiness - and still looking for the great love.
And the baby wish was removed from the list.
Earlier, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
People who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medical, why I can't.
It was really hurt.
Remaining hope that success and glory will also make happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Rickeys must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from the formula 1 was still quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled out the gloves and eliminated the sweat from the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a light band touch, Räikönen had to dispose of Alfa Romeo at the high price of Abu Dhabi after not even half of the ransom.
It was his 349. and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the engine sports class.
His wife Minttu and the two children were also traveling to the United Arab Emirates.
The world championship's biggest success was in Ferrari in 2007.
He created 21 Grand Prix victory, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte wins in the two-bob - Sports
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlete Ole Einar Björndal with 94 successes is the aim of the Bobpilot.
"I figured that I'd have to win nine and a half per season, then I could make it up to Cortina 2026," said the BSC Oberbärenburg double Olympiasia, who booked two successes in the races in Winterberg in two days.
Only on Saturday, he rejected the attack of John Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from Rank three to one.
Then he changed something on the material setup and went out a bigger prompt on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he sat in front of the British Brad Hall.
The third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22st victory in series.
John Lochner, who rides for Stuttgart, came to place two before this time on rank five.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed after Rank four in the first race on place eight.
"If I knew what he was doing different, then I would do it likewise," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte took the third seasonal victory in the two-bob on her homeway.
After it reached only for the fourth place in the Monobob in the spring, she ran on Sunday at the German Triple success with Anschieberin Deborah Levi to the World Cup Victory.
Twoerbob-Olympiasiager Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came on rank two with Germany's fastest Sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
Besides her Olympia Qualification, she booked the first podest place this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed on three places with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podest place in the worldcup, I'm super lucky that Mariama takes me.
I'm very happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were all right," said Burghardt and emphasized, "It's not just pushing, but there's also a lot to do around."
Jamanka was annoying a little about the not quite faultless rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the ceiling in the cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I haven't just received it and therefore I can't redeem why I finally asked for it.
Through Corona last year, I had quite other problems and never time for it.
And now he said that he was running out what was very angry with me.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seat bank.
I want to return it and then order it again because it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping started only on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No only when I get on it a extra field with the message
It was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered product.
But we still want the rolling module, just a new uninjured
And not cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write, and maybe it's just...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and Hundemama - once apart from that my dog doesn't scream or go into the children's garden, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (from 6J together) is sick, a burning of 2. degrees is recovered on Monday and has been depressive for years (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also hold emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel, we have had a lot of switching and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (because hand is in the association wg burning).
He's cold at the top and we're currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very well with my needs after affection and love.
My dog girl just boiled for him, and now he lies in his cowboy cake and relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and struck for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now remaining homework comes to us, which we naturally split up.
But cooking itself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just very well set, I am half well therapeutized and get ready.
Not good, but I'm gonna get it and I'm almost sympathetic.
My university just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15 p.m., I have a written test for which I haven't done yet and over morning anatomy hours for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral trial on Tuesday, and what then comes is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more space.
So my week goes like this: only to overmorrow, then the weekend is.
But after that, is everything going on?
Only until birthday.
Only until holiday start.
Only until weekend.
Just until...
And that's how it continues forever.
I think I'm just just so stressed that I need these spiritual points, because otherwise I'm packing it.
Somehow I feel guilty and chaotic, but otherwise I can't...
Are you like that?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am really infinitely grateful, I can't believe that in words.
I don't know if I could have survived my kptbs.
I think that's also partly related to Mental Load of Women and I thought that I'd find sufferings here...
I wish you one more relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I have received my order today unfortunately the entire different color plus surface is scratched and table bone has print.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We're very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to switch the table now, I'll get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In the rest of the world, two times.
But she was not confirmed.
Something else: I found at the school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another discipline for them like mathematics or geography.
For me, this was always a little strange, perhaps because I was matured Christianly and I always believed somehow.
How are you doing?
You may also be able to tell from colleagues and students with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate.
Does also give a curriculum, etc.
But just find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What then brings you to want to teach religion if you do not believe it?
True culture or something?
Hope you ask isn't too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Write English I understand that too well
That's been very long, then I'd look away from it.
It's okay, thank you.
I'm expecting a reply until the beginning of the next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search Help please
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (24 years old).
I think it's been a movie for youths.
In the film there are two contemporary axis (or parallel worlds).
One is the modern world (real world).
Secondly, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not sure).
Since I can't describe it further in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the ways are crossing and there is an act.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this kingdom to live myself, I mean.
The transition is, I believe, also, the grave of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers fight against each other.
If you say something, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our kid has just slept on the stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child endures much more than you think.
Make sure everything around is right, no cowboys, often walk in and watch, but no minutes of monitoring.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No kisses.
Axo and we had no sleeping bag, but always a roof.
Look at your child when it's sleeping.
Is it turning the head to the side?
Can it get up from the stomach of something?
Or is it on the front of the face in the mattress?
You can distract if everything's okay.
We have all grown up and when my husband came to the world, it was tb gang and give that you put the kids on your stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "stam customer" with you and have already bought very many articles
But why do you then offer me only 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote with a colleague from you yesterday and no feedback so far.
It is about my clothes cabinet that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not to be used at this time.
To say it clearly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the policy of this transmitter is now under all the sauces.
Almost every format is sponsored (ook), but then go on a large bed tour.
It was said that you were an "independenceal" Internet transmitter.
Citat Arno: You want to be "no running coloring column".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertiser who is trying to bring his BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course, they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they may continue to blame people.
A chrogman who is totally lacking empathy and, at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms, is trying to make ash.
How do you find this all right?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I'm asking for Rueck call, because my supplied wooden table was defectively defective.

Whether as a comforter at abdominal wound or just for cushioning – My little warmer friend is diversely substitutable.
Kirschkern kisses are a traditional means of household for welfare heating applications, as cherries can absorb heat very well and dosage again.
The removable inside box can be warmed very easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure, even if they are not so good.
The cherry cubic cushion with reference to heating is only suitable for the following uses:
Before heating the kit on an intypical smell, stock or fire spots and immediately dispose of.
Please take the inside box for heating out of the reference before!
Heating in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watt for a maximum of 2 minutes (note the details of the microwave manufacturer!)
Directly after heating, distribute the heat by shaking evenly in the kiss!
Afterwards, put the inside box into the reference.
The first heating may result in a light humidity formation on the surface, but disappears in repeated applications.
Do necessarily follow the specified heating instructions as longer times or higher energy performances can cause damage (exflammatory and combustion hazard!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the warmed inside boxes have been put back into the reference, please check the temperature of the kit for suitable for babies (max. 43 °C) on your armboog!
Do not use the cushion in acute, chronic, inflammatory or fever, circulational problems, fresh haematoma, haemoglobin and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded through my network.
I bought this new one about five months ago, so I should still work.
I thought the net part alone is also enough to operate.
The battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the plugged power.
Then I've expanded the battery, but there's nothing to do here.
Will you have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network operation?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat area is...
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 backpack of Peak Design no problem!
20 liters of capability also swallow larger photo equipment without problems that can be safely concealed by means of the polluted FlexFold sharer.
And what else you need on everyday items, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configureable interior remains well organized and separated from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is still presenting in a new look.
The smart, minimalistic design has it in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that protect the inside of the backpack safely and yet provide fast access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two possibilities: once conventionally via the locker, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proved itself at the Messenger Bags.
In the closure cap there is a closure of metal with a suitable anchor bar on the front of the backpack.
In contrast to most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of various "fill stands" because there are 4 anchor bars, which are stablely destroyed, in which the closure cap can be mounted.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper.
Closures and hooks are also magnetic.
In this way, the backpack can also be closed reliably without breaking into the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the everyday backpack fundamentally from others, photo-back bags: Besides the ceiling ceiling, there is a rib-closure opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the largest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to hide through the content anymore!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the dailyness of the backpack enormously: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel bags.
In the everyday backpack you can configure the inner space individually (more below) and so easily distinguish both from each other - and access independently by the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side out of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main case, while the everyday things are safely staying in the left backpack half and not intervening.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable belts help with it.
And since the outer cap of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weather-fast nylon, the content remains dry even when it is supposed to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited for the email of their support.

Hello, my order is #NUMBER#. When is the article delivered?
Order and payment was made on 12.1.21.
A completely different lamp was delivered to me than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend me the voucher, I will immediately give up a larger order, but I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and didn't send back.
And that the last year, different from the thought, I couldn't know and have just not been able to resolve it timely and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to appreciate the requirements of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of braking also under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from guss and then mechanically processed (bored and cut).
All thin discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are own for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production programme is set up, which is based on the characteristics of the original assembly by evolving the disc.
The tonned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
In addition, created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, improving the cleaning of brake discs and brake cloths.
The aesthetic properties of our thin discs underline the character of each car by attractive and remarkable appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event marked the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered bright pieces in the water at the southern curtain of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from Nah and Fern and made Coloma one of the fastest growing and florating cities of the country.
Areas were disposed, tents were put up, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share in the wealth of the country.
For many, it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who wants to make a name in the west of riches.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build business.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overcome your pioneer colleagues in order not to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a quick strategy game with many ways to win.
You select your actions simultaneously, you have to hold your resources and build a tableau, which "works" more and more for you (the so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tabletau allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to turn rules to your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual game style using fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma) over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California was officially established).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will select a location on the board at the same time as they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is discovered and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, he gets a lock!
This disables half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternating actions, such as the gain of resources, the movement of cars, the setting of tents, the search of rivers, the construction of bridges, the opening of businesses and the positioning of revolver heroes.
When all the actions have been completed, the pioneers return.
The awarder turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on until the pricer moved five times, so every location has been hidden once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack against an aggression of angry bandites.
If the players have accompanyed enough revolt heroes and are payablely superior to the bandites, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive less rewards or end at the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final assessment.
The player wins with most winpoints!

"Why children are not Tyranns" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentation has appeared today in my Twitter-Timeline, and I looked at it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is pleased to see a visitor in Talkshows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrans" (2008) he launched a vigorous educational debate.
Former patient: women and teachers now raise severe claims against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other officers must never, never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for its development and to make the framework for the child as useful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries consult about the decline of the test obligation for three-fold vaccinations
At their next meeting, the Ministers for Health of the Countries want to decide on a ban-wide departure of the test obligation for three-fold vaccinations.
"We countries need rapid clarity, whether and when for three vaccinations the test obligation can be avoided," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministerial Conference, the "Picture on Sunday".
The disappearance of 2G plus for three vaccines is "not only medically meaningful, but also delivers an additional vaccine," said Holetschek.
The Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) said that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministerial Conference on the next Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I best do that?
Hello, I like the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I can't see how high the seat is.

What can this be for?
What you describe is described as *Awareness*, i.e. sensual perceptions under full-narcose.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
The most frequent is the hearing of noises/voices, more rarely the view of images and most rarely the experience of pain.
This issue is relevant: Emperor cuts are operations associated with an increase in the rate of Awareness, as you avoid a very deep drugosis to protect the child until abnatural.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the narcotic talk.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment by me describes Awareness correctly, but had** u/Nitemarex **per definition none.
Have read her comment wrongly.
The chair is defective.
There the 20€ do not help us either.
These are legal guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be that they would withdraw the defective chair.
This is also standard in the field of eCommerce in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if they at least withdraw the defective chair.
Then we sell the second chair privately.
We also lose some money.
I already sent you a mail that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
In order and on the invoice, the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The spider is a company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they were only delivering before the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anybody who can wear the heavy furniture in the first floor.
Isn't I calling?
I had written a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97-year
He profiled himself as a theatre critic and as an intent.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's still the new book on the table, printing fresh: "An old man gets older."
The shaking diary of a slow departure from the world that the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of the lecture, the message comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I've been witnessing my life-thank."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most commonly used are Europe's lats, standardised wooden palettes, which are used mainly in the European area as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Palettes Association EPAL
In 2020, according to Statistics Austria, over 10 million pieces of pallets were produced in Austria.
Production value was approximately 79 million euros.
How many palettes are imported annually to Austria will not be raised

Download Tips & Tricks
I had got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect Gulasch.
That was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butterzart!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I came to the taste and I want to cook to Silvester for the first time Rouladen.
Tomorrow, I'm gonna use a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a big pot.
What's going on now?
What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer so good, but I get that.
II's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today, the money hasn't come in with me.
Please check it out.
Where there are in the room of Lübeck or Christmas breads
For many people Gans or Ente belongs to the Christmas days such as the tooth tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought poultry yet?
Now the time's gonna be short.
We tell you where you're coming to the Lübeck room for another Christmas bread.
The "Drive" of a tube ending level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar reinforcer sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor scenario.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME ruler, you can set the desired level on the one hand and then the decay content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "gain" and the distortion.
On the top, it already sounded like that with the POWER LEVEL rule you can even make a reserve of performance when it goes unhappily loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL rules, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone box can also be used as a line output.
The signal attached here is handled with a box simulation, so you can get an outstanding "acoustic" sound impression even when you use a headphone or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX book so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A Tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
If you also donate a VFS5 foot key, you can also easily call the sounds per foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and the speed of the corresponding compatible effects "tape".
This is essential for the live effort.
With its new power packages, VOX will go a further step in the future!
But had this seen with others like that.
Is there then an opportunity for you to send the lamp back?
Because she hangs too low for a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you keep helping me?
What about the commode?
In the next few weeks, do we receive an update to the exact delivery date?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it's not possible, I'd be satisfied with a dismissal or a voucher.
I may find a dealer for the furniture.
Only more than 1,000 euros for goods I don't need are a lot.
I just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the planned hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
The negotiations on the re-establishment of the International Atomic Agreement have made progress according to Iranian information.
"Both sides are shortly in front of agreeing on the issues that are to be held on the agenda," said Iran's Chief Underseller Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the News Agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first, there was no agreement on the subjects to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, Vienna's discussions on the releasing of the agreement were continued after almost a week of interruption.
In the negotiations, subcontractors of Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia participate.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in negotiations.
Thüringen excreted Sachsen - Freistaat now Bundesland mit höchst Corona-Inzidenz
Thüringen has relocated Saxony and currently shows the highest incidence in the country wide.
As the only country, the value is above the brand of 1000.
As the only country, Thüringen was located above the brand of 1000 at Corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute indicated the seven-day value with 1025 re-infections per 100.000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always been the highest incidence in the country, this value was 990,5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thüringen was slightly decreased, but also above the value of 1000.
In Thüringen, new infections with the Sars-CoV-2-virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within a day of 2242.
200 severe in Covid-19 sick were treated intensively medical in hospitals on Sunday.
In weekends, reporting delays may occur.
In addition, healthcare offices have been overloaded for weeks and have hardly come after with the collection of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery takes place only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until that time.
I have to print it and stick on the package and give it off at the post that was, right?
I don't have to click/supple/fill anything further here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, so I'll write you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a frequencies in my eyes.
It's time for changes
###Monthday is welcome to me, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the post here?
When you look at the activity in the last months of the MFP, you can find one: it is not an existing one.
We came into a winter star and expanded the summer hole to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
Mostly, this is just supposed to be related to dissatisfaction, how some things have passed out here and how we are in general.
In the last days, the impression has grown, that many here really still have a bock on the Mbthday.
# What we need to change
At this point, the Community is asked around the Mb-hourday, which wants to keep it alive.
The prompt came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last days and has found one, simply said, screw hoops.
After some, several people from the Community who want to rebuild the project have been found and rewritten.
However, I would like to expressly call on all to participate once again, only so this project can also have a future existence.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Objectives:
* How will the Mbndhesday work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be modified/ adjusted/removed?
* How are we going to appear outside in the future?
* How should new members be advocated?
* How do we create a fair choice system?
I am quite sure I have forgotten some things, but not bad, we have the discord at the end.
If you want and have time, come to the discord, work with and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered you a lamp screen to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/clumped for it and is not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered you another hanging for that.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft shoe.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are there those also in oversize, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# I have to be able to guarantee that the wrong lock is retrieved immediately.
And I'm asking you to leave that now.
I don't have a suitable package, but I'm going to unmount the cabinet as far as possible for the pick-up - they have to clear with #PRS_ORG#, as this can then work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to agree a pick-up date.
Is there a instructions for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get this or to decide for the return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She's been living vegetarian for a while, and she's probably eating meat very rarely.
I was Vegetarier a few years before.
As to the question whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarism had been a planned intermediate step, I have answered honestly without much to think.
And I long thought that as a vegetarian, I would support the animal welfare, but at some point reflected and understood that I finally support animal welfare.
So my decision to become vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression that it came up on her side discouraged, and she then defended vegetarism and said she knew where her meat came from and reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are fast put into a corner as a Veganer and come up conflicts without which you would create it.
It greets a harmonious Veganerin (;
It is clearly not an exception in accordance with § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not dissociate from the legal requirements for remote use.
I am on the assigned date at which #PRS_ORG# get my retour not on site.
Since I can't be on site because of a funeral, this cannot also be changed.
Can I have an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I have been able to meet again.
Lahnsteiner Army for Water Rescue equipped: 45,000 Euro Subsidy from the country
Recently, Rheinland-Palessian Innenminister Roger Lewentz in the Lahnsteiner Rathaus issued a grant certificate of EUR 45,000 for the new equipment car Water rescue the volunteer firewear Lahnstein to Oberborgermeister Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle in use since November 2020 was EUR 135.000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country Rheinland-Pfalz supports us here," says Lahnstein's Colonel Champion Peter Labonte.
The equipment car is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Pfalz.
Over and under water they fulfil the tasks of water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, you are expected to use increasing efforts: The tree of hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel, as well as the further use of the Lahn as the recreational flow, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed its recommendations, however, have synchronised, removed and the app reloaded NOT work.
I am somewhat frustrated because all the action has taken me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection from #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order procedure?

Thank you for the first time that you put the whole thing here, I've also spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, speaking we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I don't want to go into it!
The question of right and left is always very simplified.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the government servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, in special uniforms and arms to attract people to the right of conservative magic should also be clear that then, of course, these people can be hard to deal with the living reality is also clear, because, of course, you have in addition to the average white, now many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and so I do not mean the excessive female clinical clergy, because they are in the executive rather less to none but quite normal men and women that you don't notice if they don't tell you) and also on these people and I have to rely on them, because in doubt they will save your life or set this for you.
However, even if it sounds like a conservative attitude, these marginal groups also represent, even though it is the first time that I have experienced it, speaking proudly in Germany and feelings that excessive left policies are less picked up, even if this policy is supposed to be used for them or believes it is necessary to make them right, they simply want to be treated completely normal.
Back to the right, since, of course, police and forces are also a cross-border section of society, you will also find extreme rights there, but they may openly say their opinion there, or even openly smuggling any state-threatening plans is medically overdriven and angry me too.
Of course, just as policemen and soldiers who were often in abroad often begin to pausely because of negative experiences and even say things controversial to politically incorrect.
It also occurs that right mindmates also meet a rainy exchange of thoughts.
Yet, I think that it is a good fight, and it is also counteracted with political education and education!
Germany is so very internationally cracked and that is also my opinion that we could not at all afford to have real racists and Nazis in our series!
Yes, what I don't understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, I wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
It was confirmed by me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order that is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black to Germany or this basket is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But above the edge of the wooden part are two deep corpses filled with something yellow.
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More ordinary by child?
Hello, me (w32) has been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (in self-employed, very little leisure), but I have been getting more bad than right to lead my household permanently clean and properly.
There are always stages in which everything remains lying, and then and when it grabs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it's never really so “that someone can be visited spontaneously”.
My husband is not better either, though it disturbs me somewhere, but mostly my household simply loses against work and dislust.
The kitchen is most frequently cleaned as we like to cook.
Now, to my question, have you managed to become more ordinary with a child?
We have nothing yet but work on it and this question has been busy for me for a long time.
For I have no incentive, it just doesn't disturb me so much as long as no visit comes and, for example, there's always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child, or do you remain snatchy?
Look at your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality and anatomically pre-formed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus enables almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further marking on the joints for improved freedom of movement (in arm and knee bows)
To the Focea Comfort 4 the Flex System 2 was more than doubled the area covered by the Flex system to further increase the comfort.
Nightless Stretch pans on the joints reduce the friction (axles, arm and knee bows)
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and in the steps ensure a close, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the Lendenwirbel area increases the flexibility around the backdrop closure and thus improves the comfort, especially when we bucking and mounting and building the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone that is located around the shoulders and on the back guarantees increased flexibility when moving the arms and the back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-deviating material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the breast, it brings heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Nightless, thin (-2 mm) density on the face of the hood increases comfort, density and sustainability (separate head head)
Soft zone in the crochet improves the digestion with a fine-adjustable latching by a flexible, boiling crochet closure that does not hold on to the casing or to the necks
Double manchets with rib closure to arms and footstrokes combine a coverable inner manchet with a soft, cashed neoprene outer manchet
45° incorporation at the end of the inner manchet for increased elasticity and loadability when dressing.
Long rib closure on the neck with an elaskin reinforcement, for an atomic cut with increased comfort on the whole without hood
Long G-Lock P back-closure (overall without cube) with metal-shaper and integrated water Dam system for improved condensation (Beuchat Patent)
Ridge closures on arms and legs
Neoprine reinforcements at all ends of the ribs to prevent a rib, if excessive force is applied.
Neoprine panels bundled with outer and inner overlap
Borders of the outer manchets seamed for greater load
Edges of the interior manchets incorporated for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer to its place, especially in deeper diving gangs (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-safe personality disturbance?
I have done a training in the field of software development and have been learned for about a year.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right thing for me, why I have been thinking about restarting and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-safe (or fearlessly avoiding) personality disturbance (EVPS).
That means grossly that I don't feel self-worthy and are therefore shocked.
I have no problem talking to people at the level of law, but it is very difficult for me to have more relaxed conversations and I have been told more often that I act inappropriately (which I think that has already become better).
Can I become social workers like that?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or at an open youth meeting, but rather in addicts or family support, for example.
I do not know, however, whether the specific working day is really the way I imagine it is, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because every time there's something to do with my code ("whether it's more easy to do") and it's difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues to help ("I should now really know myself how to do"/"I think he's going on with my stupid questions from work"/"he really needs to think me being less-measured" etc.).
I'll probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to mention it on the spot.
But you've already retired the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I'm waiting for a date for pickup
What do they mean to return, please!
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message will be your #PRS_ORG# will not authorize this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (proteine) recorded with the feed divides the bird in its stomach darm traction into the individual protein components (amino acids) and builds from these its own proteins, which it also needs for feeding.
The feather formation of the nestling and the feather re-formation of the mazing bird are very complex operations and are associated with a particularly high propulsion for the animal's total organism.
Please note that NECTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as otherwise disturbances may occur.
Following this courageous administration of NECTON-Bio, vitamins should be returned to the daily supply of NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON MSA (mineral preparation).

It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/weight feed as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A scraped measuring apple (inside) corresponds to 1 g NECTON-Bio.
In case of severe feather damage, the double or three-dose NECTON-Bio can be administered at the beginning until the approach of the feather re-formation is visible.
The normal dose will then be given until the feather reform is fully completed.
Storage: NECTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is sold as a office chair.
How can a office chair be broken after 9 months?
The guarantee claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an e-mail on Monday to announce that my order was damaged and attached to images.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a community employee in the reconciliation of the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
We want a whale tree to be enjoyed on our property.
So the case application was made to the municipality.
A employee writes to me that the case of fruit trees and thus also the whales are not part of the statute.
However, in the statute, the whale noss is explicitly indicated as a protective tree.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert statement.
On the other hand, the Statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use them new packaging for this.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Can you offer me a dismissal or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that only the question is whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the ceiling to Germany
Can you check that out?
Notification: Severe transport accidents at self
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the self-nord and Plößberg connection point.
As the police press alarm announces today (14:03 p.m.), a truck has arrived in the counter transport.
There are injured.
I'm okay.
All right, then thank you again that it went so easy!
Council and ideas for further professional life
First happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good because my dear head is just crippling everything you can crush.
Before I get out of here now .. shortly: I need advice and the best of people who know my situation somehow - so from you.
I'm just doing the ref as a crossing climb.
Originally I studied something else and also worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I don't call anything more precise here).
But then everything was too boring to me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
Sometimes I landed at the Teaching Office and was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are clearly inflexibleer than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have arrived at the third "I google other job invitations".
And it's only half a year.
In the paints before, I have always decided to continue and at least end the ref, afterwards I can still turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I've been totally exposed.
There are vacations now, but there's still a bunch of work waiting for me.
Before the ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was my weekend also my weekend and my holiday evening my holiday evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work was no matter in the moments.
Now, the family celebration myself is too much stress.
And then there are these stare structures that are extra nervous to me.
In principle it makes fun and looks outwardly the ref is also running well as feedback and so.
But I'm totally excited and wondering how much stress my body endures before he gets completely close - if he's not doing that right now.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of the work life - just if I read some contributions from you here - or whether I shouldn't go back to the old area, as where I was valued, could take me free time if I needed it, and although the work was somehow bored, but was appropriately paid for it and together in a team that worked and not as a single fighter as it is now most of the time of the case.
But then I wonder if I haven't arrived at the same place as now and inadequate in one year.
You realize that it's all somehow us, but maybe you have come out as an outstanding council or ideas, like I'm from this situation that I'm completely finished and, at least, to begin crying about it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me first.
Thanks for reading and apologize for my weeping subtone.
I hope my situation has become a little clear at least.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has been continuously developed, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" scenario that perfectly simulates the behaviour of a tube reinforcer.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps we imagine a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely on the latest state of the technology in things sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), based on the analysis of components and Amp switches, the VTX amplifiers are waiting for an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also, of course, contain the multi-stage valvetronix pipe pre-amps.
This is partly based on real analogous switches, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube reinforcer better than any simulation.
In addition to this clarified switch, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only sprout like that.
With the "Tone Room" software of VOX, you can even correct and hide historical facts at the virtual level until the Amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet newly arrived sound requirements, which in 2010 has led to a re-performance of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and decisively improved reinforcer models.
From handful VT20+ to VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists are found in search of a maximum sound multiplied here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a pipe reinforcer: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced play of game dynamics and saiten attacks, as well as a quick talk.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that, in particular, the final level determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The valve reactor-screw of each VT+ amplifier with a 12AX7 tube is perfectly the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Lose Magic at Clippers
The settlement series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - for the victory against the Los Angeles Clippers, however, is not enough.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz lost the magic on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main box is also adaptable: with three individual placement and foldable cluster parts, it is fully adjustable according to your photo equipment needs and is therefore suitable for any type of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all size orders to full-format reflex cameras.
What eventually fits in the backpack depends of course on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible occupation would be a DSLR camera with a occupied object, two to three alternate objects and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further objects.
In addition, a lot of accessories can be disappeared.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Serie) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photographic objects.
Drohnen-pilots also meet an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulcan outbreak on La Palma: probably longer in history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the lava streams on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is a end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcano outbreak on La Palma has been the longest in the famous history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
To date, the outbreak of the Tehuya volcano was 84 days in 1585 as the longest on the Atlantic island near the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in the past days, but volcanologists would not continue to foresee when it could end.
The indicators refer to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the State TV broadcaster RTVE.
Injury in millions
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 housing houses and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a metre thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to over EUR 900 million.
Before the coast, two new landings were created by cold lava with a size of about 50 hectares.
The island's most important banana cultivation, about half the approximately 85,000 inhabitants lived directly or indirectly before the volcano outbreak in the crisis, was seriously affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is in front of the door, and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the crustling tension somewhat deductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly split society together.
The more important it is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift, so that the gesture of the gift, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mouse, had been a peaceable "Societal Contract of Nature Peoples", could be disappeared and refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became a Christian child
It was thoroughly the Protestants through which the Christmas days were closely linked to the cup.
Previously, on Nikolaus' day, gifts were transferred to some kind.
The background of this popular seed today is that the Holy Nikolaus as Bishop of Myra cast three women secretly gold into their window in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift, the popular custom in Germany showed to fill the boots, especially the children, with gifts.
Protestants rejected this custom because they rejected intermediaries between God and humans as "sacred worship".
For these reasons they retain themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child from Nikolaus and thus founded a new tradition line.
The focus of the kick was thus moved to the Holy Bend.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, it is only the least that the use of the Holy Nikolaus, similar to Martinsingen and Martinsing, is still a solid part of the past night.
Today you can find in stiffs before the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to luxury watches to be desired everything the heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of gifting since the 13th century on the day of the Holy Nikolaus.
With the reformation, the day of the gift moved to the Holy Bend.
In all Christianly marked countries, however, there is a joyful mould on the question, who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christian child appears on the Holy Evening or on the Christmasman, who is, in principle, a type of Nikolaus, which has been assigned some own species in time.
These include, for example, his white noise bar, which has only little to do with the more stringent Assyrians of the historical figure, his sleeve, which is drawn by retirement and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands the Holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at Christmas festival.
In Spain the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana that should have guided them the way to the child of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, the gifts sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some commendation.
There are not cleansers here, but three horses who draw his sleeve as a troika.
In Czech Republic, the parent of the reformation of the host wars, the Christian child is responsible for the donation of the gifts.

Police shoots disgusting bankrupts near the king's palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a gunman was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police announced that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone with a gun into a bank and the business of a bookmaker.
The man fled, according to the authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
There had been shots and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead.
The police didn't go out of a terrorist background.
Several messages are placed in the area around the Kensington Palast.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other families of the royal family also live there.
Which?

Pillen Problem
Hello, Dear Women's People,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, after a year's saving is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started to take the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this again because by chronic illnesses I have to take enough medicines that I can't choose.
My main problem, not surprisingly the pain, but my skin.
At my last two-year break, I had got from 0 to 100 explosive pickel and these everywhere.
That's so superficial, but I've been very stressed and I didn't feel well.
In the two years of break, the whole has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any hints to avoid this time.
Perfume-free and without goats, my cosmetics are already, but maybe there's what someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the woman's doctor did not take me so seriously and the skin doctor's date is still coming.
Thank you very much for everybody who read through the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is so neat.
Had pre-bupertary bad neurodermitis, then a time of peace, then spacious kneet fleet and the acne theme.
I also tried to feed all the possible things in the course of disease and I remained hanging on sugar, milk and meat poor mixed food because otherwise nothing worked so well.
It can also be good that Hormonell is just the worm in it, but if you have as I have a building site everywhere, you would rather not go looking for what else is still wrong.
I already had all her colleague semina o.a.
Written and now I lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concern.
I must always work in between and to the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my banking data, maybe there was something wrong.
But there is it in general in large

110-kV earth cable is rebuilt in 2022
The authorisation for the transfer of the new high voltage cable at Tann is legally effective.
The plan determination decision of the Government of Niederbayern frees the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This now shared the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometres of the earth's cable will connect the circumference of Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt lead between Simbach and the churches.
The cable is connected close to the village of Edermanning at Reut to a Mast of the Free Direction.
Good morning,
my order of 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has just arrived in parts to us.
The blue Betsell number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Not possible for delivery".
All three other packages have arrived, so that a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the next process is now?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget that, I have explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a commode of glass and the entire pages are placed, so it is all over glass and the box is broken

Thanks for the message
But why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's for all books, therefore the request for #PRS_ORG# because it's probably a general problem.
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I have been in the ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I have still great problems at the moment to plan my time-effective education in the field of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can in principle only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In the school, I can only copy s/w free of charge (which is nervous for geography).
I just need a very long time right now to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the topic of geo factors and I actually stand for every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs etc.).
In planning, I'm always going out of the learning goal (which I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build this (mostly I'm making a workheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
This is why the worksheets are also available.
Maybe a geography teacher can help me work time-efficiently with the book.
I'd be very happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already decided for a new at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to do the return for the first time as soon as possible.
Trade fears because of the 2G regulation about Christmas business.
In most businesses only who is vaccinated or healed.
Trade considers that unnecessary and complained turnover infringements.
A possible solution has also been prepared.
The 2G regulations ruin the important Christmas business from the view of the German trade association (HDE).
In the case of businesses with articles of non-daily demand, turnover infringements should be complained, criticized HDE head of business manager Stefan Genth.
According to a current HDE survey below 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already declined the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive highlight of the year, is now often a hole without ground," said Genth.
Therefore, traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis rates in the end of the week.
It is good to run only in food retail and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the principal business manager.
"2G in shopping does not bring us further in the fight against the pandemics," he stressed.
The current rules shocked customers and demanded high staff use.
The bandage scheme had to be approved in the whole of the world, he requested.
After that, every customer had to be controlled only once on 2G (vaccinated or healed) and would have joined all businesses with the received band on this day.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport at the 3G rule (vaccinated, healed or tested) - sample checks should be sufficient.
The German Euroshop company specialised in shopping centres also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The last rates were around 75% of the pre-corona level without 2G, the sales at about 90%.
These figures will now fall safe in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said Head Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economy Week".
Due to the high personal and administrative efforts, the Centre is trying to find and obtain solutions.
This belongs to the so-called bandlet solution, where "the visitors can, for example, make their 2G record at a central centre once and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to in a club hotel - enter all shops uninterrupted". dpa
I have recently been ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried to be cashed with a yellow fill.
That looks unpleasant.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sticked.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour.
A modern microprocessor provides extraordinary possibilities for adjusting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and art light.
It is also possible to manually configure and store color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash Saver.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitively usable.
The light generates a very light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flaming free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can light large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
In other words, reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can virtually adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both at the film set or at the studio.
The optional available DMX512 -Controller allows remote control of the light in TV studios or when the light is mounted at difficult accessible places.
On the back of the light, the control panel consists of keys and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
In addition, the slot for the NP-F battery is located there (not included in the volume of delivery)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To execute the settings of individual settings on the memory spaces, simply pressing one of the memory keys is used and finished.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when newly activated, the known situation will be restored - very practical when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality is the possibility of operating with cheap NP-F battery.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the battery has sufficient power - it's a battery switch equal to installed - for each of the two battery recorders a value in the two displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the lighter over the supplied net part with electricity.
The construction of the lamp is very simple.
You have a 16mm shield for fixing as a connection, so you can directly access your photo stativ.
The tendency shall be reliably adjusted by mounters on both sides.
It was taken into account that the mechanical components are extremely high-quality and are therefore also designed for long-life and hard use.
In addition, a negotiation is included in the volume of delivery.
Grossarty is what is also included in the range of delivery.
This allows you to transport or store the light with all the accessories you may want to buy, safely or without problems.
Sadly, I got this gift and she's too small:(
"Party we wanted to throw: Frankfurt celebrates after a dry comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Industry Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series of victorious hesses was supposed to be on the way to the next federal liga pile.
But then the SGE turned up, shot the frustration of a grown seasonal start of the soul within a good hour, and won furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," praised the trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and said a "Pauschal-Lob, to everybody who was with it."
At the beginning, it looked like a new steamer for the now on rank nine still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusener with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am crazy happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Also defence players Christopher Lenz, who had been able to stand back on the place since the fourth day of the game and his overwhelmed muscle injury, stressed the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old and looked forward to the result especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the future tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus, but it is also well set up with regard to the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live high-professional.
Now you want to "step for step and keep modest" and carry out the tasks until the yearly change "to this level".
The next is on Wednesday in the course of the English week a game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky) on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you because of a mistake from my side.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is rejected and the order is resigned?
Unfortunately, I would say I won't be ordering again because it has been very long.
Have you seen them on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Dempers for handball women before quarterly finals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women swallowed with hanging heads and empty views from the parkett.
At the end of the WM headquarters, DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) before 800 audiences in Granollers took a defeat and must now run against the host of Spain in the quarterly final.
"We were too worried and had too much respect for the opponent," condemned Federal Trainer Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's bad that we couldn't take the flow.
This was a bad game of all we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entering into the semi-finale, a significant increase has to be made against the WMs of 2019 on the next Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German advertiser in the duell with the three-time Olympic Denmark was the back room player Alina Greseels with six gates.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in the defense," admitted backspace player Xenia Smits and asked, "We have to look forward quickly."
From front to back not at height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the pitch was not high.
Fails and technical faults in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a fast 0:4-response after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some parades worse.
The first gate managed the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Greseels successfully completed a rapid counterfeiting.
However, the hoped initial ignition was not this.
In contrast to the aggressive coverage of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in scenes - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt at the gate of the Scandinavian Virgins.
Thus, at 3:10 after 20 minutes, the party had run early, especially when backspace player Mia Zschocke saw a little later because of a hard fool on her opponent.
But in the quartalfinal, she may be able to participate again.
Only during the final phase of the first half-time, the DHB selection came a little better into the game and until the break at least at five gates.
The only silent hope for a pick-up hunt after the change was after seven minutes at 9:19 there.
Again, the Greener protectors sinned in all areas and made it the well-established opponent that is one of the Medal Candidates at the end.
As a result, the German team could no longer raise itself to an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the parkett.

The title appears to be vaccinated in mobile vaccine teams where (for now only) the BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon ready for a large part, it will take part in vaccine centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are not personally related (e.g. "I take medicine X, this is dealing with vaccination.").
In my task area, the information for the vaccination, the indication position (Person has the right to vaccination according to Corona vaccination regulation and no reason to speak against), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in the event of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, e.g. medical professionals.
However, in vaccine teams we often have no part, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but which cannot carry out vaccines (may?), so I also carry out most vaccines there myself.
Severe "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an amberger, the BR television "We in Bayern" has been provided for intense thoughts.
However, different from many previous days, the term remained in the series "Host mi?" this time from the callers.
No, it wasn't a "human who's nervous."
And no one, "what everything has to go fast."
That, the people heard from the TV-Moderator, were totally wrong.
What the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also made it surprising for many top palates.
"The Hudler," the viewers learned, "is a lap with which someone wipes the oven."
Dialekt researcher Anthony Rowley, consulted by Bayerian television for years as an expert, confirmed that.
With the note that this is a typical uppermost term derived somehow from the well-known mouth type "houders".
What was closed with an educational gap - probably also for some who have lived in Amberg's room for a long time.
I can't buy any more books for two weeks.
There is always the following error after confirmation: opens - someting went wrong - try again later.
I restarted the #PRS_ORG#gel#PRS_ORG#n, reconnected, synchronized and repaired with the PC.
Nothing helped.
Dive choice at the race wheel- really so safe?
Today morning, I was awakened with a lot of acts because I wanted to train at least a little for preparing my bike tour in the next week.
Said, done, and I drove with my race wheel, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what happened in so every inner city (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) was that.
Glass splitter on the route.
Zack, noise and my rear maturity were no longer trying to join the rest of the route.
Because of the day of the week, I had no real way to get a replacement mantle and a replacement snake, I had to turn back half bad noise and take the first best train home.
It wasn't very bad to then, perhaps it's better if I practice it again before the bike tour with the tire change.
But now I'm in front of a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days before me, I would get very disadvantaged this problem more often.
Now wasn't really bad, since the old tyres of the pre-owner (very nice old man, came the day when I picked up the bike until 14 a.m. 120km!) and who had also described it as suboptimal because he was going on role with them for more years.
But if I think I have to do another tire change when I drive to 80-90kms, then I think I'm really badly disguised :D
Now I came into the conversation with an elderly man at the railroad, who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; they should be unpluggable.
Now, of course, it sounds very attractive.
But are these really so incapable?
I have little desire to spend 40€/ribs now, only to be disappointed.
In addition, I wonder: I have currently on the race wheel I think 25x622.
Although there are (or seemingly?) there are also the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already broader.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on a race wheel for other tyres?
The sulphur page seems to be my absolute! Laieviden rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car swallowed against tree: driver injured fatally
On the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten, the 53-year-old was stabbed with his car for an unclear reason against a Middle Island and then run on the counterway, as the police announced.
There it came to a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old car was then swallowed against a tree and the man sticked in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old advisor were severely injured in the event of the accident and brought to the surrounding hospitals.
yes, we have deleted all the books all of them authorized and loaded new books

After the publication of our new High End Broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a question of time until our SOLO series would return to grown up again.
SOLO 15 is called the new syringe and optically reminds of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this suggestion a suitablely designed foot is included directly in order to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This does not affect the acoustic and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people where the maximum volume plays a more subordinated role but is to be achieved an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to create almost unfiltered such large sound pressure levels.
But that does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerably adult and extremely impressive and precisely for its size.
Tonal was voted on the SOLO 15 with a slight high-tonish increase.
This is common in broadbands in order to optimize the too high frequencies with a great increase in bundling.
Exactly oriented to the hearing area, the SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound.
Lightly rotated outwards can reduce the high-tonish range and thus make the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the placement of the individual components of a music piece in the optimal stereo triangle is fair and surprisingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 HM provide an enemy dynamic that seeks the same.
The SOLO 15 supplements not only our SOLO series, but expands it in matters of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our construction sets, it is recommended at the beginning to make thoughts about the final optic of the speaker in order to plan appropriate changes in construction.
For example, if you want to furnish the housing, the reduction of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the furniture is reproducing material.
After cutting all plates (e.g. in the construction market), you should first bore a 8 mm hole into the floor plate at the corresponding place to be able to run the cable easily there later.
With the help of an upper seed, the opening of the speaker in the front is now followed so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used permanently later.
Backwards, this opening should be equipped with a 45° phase to make the opening surface of the speaker chasis as large as possible inside.
The four scratching points of the B 100 - 6 OHM will be interrupted in the phase, as shown in the picture “Detail Phase”.
Then you start with the actual structure of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface.
On these, the back wall, the deck, the front and the ground are now trained.
The three steeps should also be used and sticked.
The steeps themselves can vary in the material strength if necessary, for example, if you want to use finished performance from the construction market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step of work, the second page will be applied.
Afterwards, all plates of the foot follow, the two sides, as well as the front.
A suitable hole ring saw or forest driller will facilitate the placing of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connector clamp on the back wall.
Then one uses a circular seed for rounding all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footboard can also be rounded.
Afterwards, the footboard is tightly tightened with the foot of the housing and screwed in addition with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and front drilling (2.5-mm drills) of the scratch points of the speaker chasis and the connector climb.
After the housing of wood dust has been cleaned (sucking/blowing out), one begins with the removal of the cable.
This is the easiest thing through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and unabbreviated cable is slided for piece through the 8 mm drilling into the foot until the terminal opening and lets it stand out about 30 cm there.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the loudspeaker opening and also lets it hang out more easily there.
The frequencies are subsequently prepared and used.
The design plan of the frequent branch, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Montage instructions Solo 15.
If the frequencies are installed and the connecting terminal is screwed, the seal of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box is not fully closed.
Through the 35 mm BASREFLEX opening and somewhat skill, you can drop hot sticks on the opening and thus close.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the condensation accordingly.
Now follow the damping according to description.
Afterwards, the B is connected to 100 - 6 OHM and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus pipeline (marked cable) must be launched at the Pluspol of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is reduced to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe).
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and is loosely distributed in the housing.
The opening around the base reflex channel should be held free.
Can I give up a order now and let it be delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> Finally, we can announce that we will organise the OSCAST again this year!
> We are unfortunately not able to get more than four people into the studio for known reasons, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
ABBER: There will be at least three people on a switch, so we will follow the Oscars in 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we will give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will go about 0:30.
If you're already making a cold drink, you're planning good food and making you ready for a long but very interesting night.
