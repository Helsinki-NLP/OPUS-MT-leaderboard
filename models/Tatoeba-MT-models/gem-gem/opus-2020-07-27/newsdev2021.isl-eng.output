Biden conducts inquiries in three key countries
In only 100 days of elections, Joe Biden, a prominent Democrata, will have a preliminary effect in three important fluctuations.
CNN reports today that Biden was over to Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden is measured with 51% in conjunction with 46% with the President.
In Arizona, the status is 49-45% of Biden in will and in Michigan is in the superior victory of Biden, because there it leads with 12 points, 52%-40%.
In order to win the elections in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all these countries, and actually more.
Trump is now sitting up with a crown - virus age that nationals teach him more and more, saying that most of the people in question have responded badly, or very bad at the beginning of the epidemic.
In addition, Trump has come badly out of protests and disguises that caused George Floyd to die.
Though Trump and his government have wronged them.
To crown Trump's problem, he is now under serious criticism for ordering the federal police to break back protests in cities where city or government leaders are Democrats.
Has it created a huge wool among the inhabitants of the cities, and this anger is being infected to other Americans.
Also, pictures of federal police to pitch Protestants into unmarked cars have not helped the United States case.
Watched the advertisement The Lincoln Project just focused on this, but it can be seen below.
Trump conquered all three countries in 2016, but with very little differences in vote.
Trump defeated a lot of nations with a small difference of voting, and the elections were defeated by minor votes.
For example, Michigan defeated only 10.704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% of the inhabitants.
The same conclusion is to be shown by the political experts, Biden is being taken ahead.
A new study of CNN in Arizona shows that the Biden’s foregoing limits have now been identified.
Same thing as CNN and Quinnipiac University studies on Florida.
Even Fox News, who looked well to the right and declared support for Trump 2016, has published the same material in its media.
The President’s last hope, according to the findings of the question, is that Trump may have the hope to re-receive important positions within the country of the world if the attention of the electoral struggle is directed to the economy.
The economy of the United States took a heavy impact following the Covid-19 phenomenon, but it seems that the electorates do not relate the economic attack to the crown virus age.
In fact, a large majority of electorates seem to have blamed Trump for a disadvantaged response to the crown virus age, but trust him better to cope with the economic attack that occurs at this time.
On the other hand, Trump has failed to control the discussion in the electoral battle.
Following the disturbances that have almost constantly burned from the news of the video, four policemen killed George Floyd, Trump tried to direct the discussion to the law - enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order, became his characteristic words.
Now it seems to have failed, as said earlier.
As the viewpoints refer more to Trump, it is more likely that more and more Repubicans will leave Trump and describe support for various Bidens, or someone else who is then Biden without name.
This is because of the United States’ arrangement, they choose in many elections on the same code.
Thus, selecting can simply mark the second class of the presidential party of the electoral banknote, allowing it alone as voting for all its other suppliers.
Thus, the rebellious group’s prosecutors in other offices are tempting to disappear Trump’s susceptibility and achieve independent success in the elections.
Adolescent Olympics in Dakar delayed until 2026
The youth’s Olympics were to take place in Dakar in the next year, which has now been suspended until 2026 because of the crown virus age after the International Olympic Committee and Senegal agreed.
However, the expulsion of the first Olympic Games in Africa is a shock for many young athletes.
A volunteer arrested for the burn in Nantes
A volunteer in the judiciary of Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with a burning that destroyed the church.
Le Monde claims that the suspected refugee from Rwanda, who served as overseer in the church, acknowledged the fire.
The man’s lawyer speaks to another media that the man looks greatly after his actions.
Among those destroyed in the fire was an organ from the 17th century, and historically decorated windows of the church.
The 39 - year - old volunteer, who was not named, was arrested shortly after July 18th, but was released.
Then he was returned to the report yesterday, and afterwards he was arrested.
"No way out of this"
I am welcomed at Baltasar’s and Christian Samper’s home in Copavogi.
My visit is a new picture list show of Baltasar and his daughter Mireya, which will be opened on August 1st in the Charge of Little Kambi on Snowfellsnee.
This is the first time the father shows together.
I'm brought down to Baltasar's office, where a magnificent painting looks at me.
Large and dramatic pictures of males in the past, but also of flying creatures; eagle on one, shaded birds on another.
From the workroom, it's in front of the home.
“ We were with a horse here with us who wear the grass, ” Baltasar tells me.
“The harvest works much better than the sleeve machine on these holes and hills we have.”
Mireya is with us the Christian and Baltasar, and she tells us how her works are in line with the works here.
“Introduction, mix of paperworks and jewelry.
They are all very white and in contrast to what my dad is doing, where I'm working with the light, and so on," she says.
“ It’s a year since that idea came up.
Then there were some jobs I was working on, and I would have wanted to show them there, but they were trapped in Tokyo by Covid.
When my dad started painting, and I saw where he was going, I reconsidered my party," says Mireya, but Baltasar’s works have a strong divination in the Icelandic history of women’s crowns and plans.
“ When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the guys, I was glad to do a jewel that was related to them, ” says Mireya, but she works with the Victory No Bjarn Son of Goldsmith in the Sign store.
"This is how I'm gonna make an installation from the jewel."
Last year, Mireya attended the 72 artists of the Academy sensation on Snowfalsnee, including in the Little Kambi Hole, and found the building fascinating.
“ This is a new space, an old load that has recently been made up, ” says Mireya, who talked there to Baldvina Sverris’s daughter, who found Mireya and Baltasar together.
“ She wanted us both to show, and then we thought:
“ Why not?
This is a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in Spain in 1938, and he studied the Art Academy in Barcelona before he went on a world trip to study artistic collections and to conduct research.
He arrived in Iceland in 1961 and was healed by a country and a nation.
Soon later, he met his wife, Christian, and has lived here for 57 years since 1963.
Baltasar is a prestigious artist, who has held a dozen of private shows, and shows with the Christian Sea in many parts.
It is the most famous for its large wall pictures, named wall decoration in the Plateyar Church, and a fracture in the Videstad Church.
“ What affects what I do is the bitterness Iceland has and nowhere else, ” says Baltasar.
“ This low sun and these shadows that are stretched and stretched.
As soon as I arrived here, I thought, "Wow, here you can work."
Mireya is the oldest of the children of Christius and Baltasars, born in 1964.
“ It was one thing I knew, it was quite clean, that I wasn’t supposed to be a photographer, ” she asked if she wanted to walk in her parents ’ footsteps.
“So I went to a mathematics and natural science course at school and did everything I could to get out of this.
Then I realized that I was running.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laugh.
Like her father, she has shown a lot around the world.
A lot in Japan, to form.
All Balthasar’s and Christ’s sons have walked the way of art.
“ I call this virus, ” says Mireya.
"There was no way out of this."
Counter Icelandair has been in gray area when airlines were cancelled
Icelandair, a social minister, believes that it has been in a gray area when the company dismissed all airlines in the middle of a core.
Then he says that laws that meant the firemans to go into the apartments will be taken for an inspection after the burn on the Brother City Trail.
On July 17, Icelandair had the advice to cancel all the 38 airlines who worked with the company while the airline core was still on the table of the State Constituents.
It was considered that Icelandair had been able to take this statement and was prepared to resolve the matter for the Community judgment.
Yet, Icelandair and Icelandair never ended up at the end of the decrees.
However, the difference between Onear Dadason and Social Minister states that, in his mind, Icelandair’s decision was in a grey area and went to the right people’s salary.
“ My view is that this is a certain right to defend payers.
When you're in a conversation, when you're in at the seeds, it's not an option to go this way.
It's completely clear in my mind that this wouldn't have passed.
I think it is quite clear, in my mind, that men had come into the gray area where this touched," says Ásmundur.
He wouldn't speak for other companies to go the same way as Icelandair.
“It is also a dangerous discussion now that it is only normal to start to put this system up to reduce this right, and that is why I am completely opposed."
At the end of June, in which three ones died, Ansmund was also asked about the response of governments to the burning of a brother’s city course.
A council now says that the investigation is on the tables of the House and the humanitarian agency, to which he directed the recommendation.
“ Today’s law is that the fireplace is not allowed to go into the apartment.
I have asked the House's and Human Rights Agency to examine, in particular, whether there's a reason for some legislative change.
I'm ready to make the legislative changes that need to reduce the likelihood that this can happen again," says Ásmund Einar.
You can listen to the interview with Ásmund as a whole in the player below.
USA said to increase pressure on Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
The U.S. Government has made further efforts to force European companies to dismiss the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project led by Russia, according to World on Sunday, who are witnessing to people who are familiar with them.
According to the newspaper, the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and the United States Energy Ministry have contacted the European Ministry to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing the project.
Up to twelve officials should have held at least two network meetings with their representatives in the last days.
Those who witnessed the discussions said that the Americans had in a “friendly ” tone emphasised that the United States wanted to avoid the realization of North Stream 2.
“ I think this is a very, very serious threat, ” said one thirst to the German newspaper.
These threats are in line with the statement of Mr. Mike Pompeo, U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs, last week, as he warned that companies participating in the project would be the best to “come out now” or have the risk of penalties under 232 of the general law Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian ornamentalian Gazprom, who is supervised by the development of the project, five European companies participate in it.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell plus Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with the World on Sunday, the representative of the last committee said that the United States’ efforts to undermine “a major infrastructure project ” would be a clear interference in the European Empire.
In the past of the week, the American Representatives assembly adopted a change in the country defence law intended to extend the US penalties against companies involved in the construction of the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas route.
According to one shipowner, the decision may be directed to companies providing or providing ships, insurance, refusal or connectivity services for such ships, in addition to those offering a certificate for the Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and officials have repeatedly declared their disappointment in the United States' attempts to share European energy issues by using punishments against Nord Stream 2, and some have even called for Brussels to take advantage of intermediate operations.
In Moscow, consultants have also criticized Washington’s action hardly and called it unfair competition.
Earlier the week, the president’s speaker, Dmitrij Peskov, said that Russia would come up with a new plan on how the project will be completed if the Washington employees maintained the new penalties.
Prepare further transport of official institutions to land
Social and childcare ministers intend to move more public organisations to the next country.
In the autumn, the Brunavarnas area of the House's and Manufacturing Agency will be transported north of the Saudárkrok that the Minister's decision, but experts in the department have previously declared that they do not intend to move northern farming.
Onear Dadason, Minister for Social Affairs and Children’s Rights, said in Explosion on the Wave this morning that it was important for the countryside that public organizations were transferred there.
As a result, a great value creation, which also generates diversity.
“ It is important to nationally, we are trying to build up everything around the country.
Employment, money-creating structure, whether in tourism, agriculture, industry, some natural use, and this type of work that officially operates, they support it very well,” says Ásmund.
“Creates increasing diversity, creates better support for this resource exploitation and the nation’s money creation.”
The decision taken by the Ministry of Human Nuclear Energy Agency has been severely criticised by its employees and the National Association of Aviation and Hospital Transporters.
Six people who have special knowledge of burning matters and work in the department are all residents in the capital area, and none of them intends to move farms to the Seedárkrok.
“ I think it is quite clear that politics share their views on how hard it should be.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should be involved in radical actions to better disseminate public jobs," says Ásmunddur.
“We see that our neighbouring nations, Norwegians and Danir have done this with good results. ”
He is convinced that the large majority of the nation wants to see more spread in public bodies around the land.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transport of official services to a country, as I was doing with the House and Human Rights Agency.”
He illustrates the transportation of the Food Agency to the Selfoss, Iceland’s Landmeters to Akraness, and the unemployment security to the Skagastran.
“ Today’s workplace on the Shagh Coast is very important for that society.
I think we should step further into this creature."
“ I am preparing further steps in this creature.
More transport."

Gottlieb warns that the unhappy spread of the crown virus in society makes it “very difficult” to open schools in the autumn
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former CEO of the United States Food and Medicinal Products Surveillance, warned on Sunday that it would be “very difficult ” for school examples to open in a new year of study if the crown virus was spread without delay within these communities.
“ I think the school authorities need to examine the distribution within the community everywhere.
If the virus is distributed unprevented in society, it will be very difficult to open in that state,” said Gottlieb in “Face the Nation. ”
Since autumn to begin in the next few weeks, Trump’s government had encouraged the school authorities to open their schools for students and to offer education at school five days a week.
However, these trials of President Trump and Minister of Education, Betsy DeVos, a week after Trump warned that the crown virus age would probably “be worse before he improves ” and confirmed that school examples at the places where the situation is worse, may have to postpone a school opening for a few weeks.
Yet, on Thursday, a medical defence centre issued instructions on how it would be safest to open a school for students.
The instructions include the removal between loyalty, students and employees in schools, recommending the use of facial defences and the distribution of students into limited groups to reduce infection.
However, the defence centres did not publish the school managers’ guidelines on when to close schools if crown virus membranes are increasing, as Gottlieb says has been “unfortunate. ”
“When this uncertainty is rich and precise instructions have not been given on how schools will be opened, I think more parents will be careful, ” he says.
“That is why I think it is very important to get precise information about what the standards are precise, which the disease defence centres did not give in their instructions. ”
Gottlieb said school examples must consider the proportion of positive infections in society, local spread, and test ability when decisions are made on whether to keep schools open or switch the alpha to the online teaching.
If between 5% and 10% of the analyses give a positive conclusion, “the problem is having a problem” but more than 10% is“the threshold when carefully considers whether the school assessments should be closed.”
“ This is an indication that the epidemic has reached its footsteps in the community, ” said Gottlieb, adding that this would make the parts of the Floridan Kingdom, the major Crown Virus Age in the United States, difficult to open for school education for the next month.
Coron virus meats have grown into more than 30 countries and Colombia, while the gravity of the epidemic is in the solar belt called the southern coast of the United States.
Gottlieb, though, said that there was evidence that the number of cases in some countries, including Arizona and Texas, had begun to slow down.
However, despite the fact that Gottlieb had said that there was a “reasonable sign” of the slowing of the peasants in some countries in the sun belt, it is going to “heat in the coals” in others, including South Carolina, Alabama, India and Illinois.
Many government managers have set rules on the use of masks in public spaces and stopped the re-opening of destinations to trace on the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that a country should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people at restaurants, closing movie houses, and other places offering indoor entertainment, and setting rules on mask usage to overcome the pants, which are actions that enable the nations to avoid resuming the tight limits set at the beginning of the phenomenon in March.
Besides the use of masks by various countries, various companies have committed people to use face defense.
McDonald's is the most recent company to make the use of the facial defences a duty, thus adding to a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules on mask use.
Gottlieb said that he expected that more companies would take up a mask family with him, especially where the danger is considered to be high.
“If we can really control the pair when the winter goes until we get vaccine or any kind of treatment that changes the clinical process of this disease, we can do it with masks, that is relatively simple, something we can all do, but that does not change our lives directly and allows us to keep what is very important for us, like keeping some companies open and bringing the kids back to school, ” he says.
Despite the fact that Donald Trump last week did not want to make mask use in the whole country, he encouraged the Americans last week to use face defense, saying at the White House’s news conference that “they would have effect. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson, “It’s a news to expect”
Crystal Palace’s attendants were given a shield for the summer when Roy Hodgson, CEO of the company, declared the visitor’s franchise Wilf Zaha wanted to leave the company.
The Philistine Coast has been playing at Selhurst Park for more than five years, and it seems to be on the way, but it has previously been appointed to a team like Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, he will find out whether a team in that quality class is still willing to pay a high sum for him, especially in the financial uncertainty periods of sport this summer, after a period where Zaha scored four limits and made five supports for the Palace team that caused some disappointment.
In an interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the period, Hodgson said that “the news was expecting ” about the possible exit of Zaha after confirming that the visitor had“ made it clear ” that he would see his future elsewhere than with the company.
There are still three years left by the visitor’s agreement with the Palace, and last year, the company indicated that 100 million sterling pounds would be needed for the company to take it off.
Lead Hodgson ended the period with seven losses in a row and a double on the last day of the period, which resulted in the fall of the team to the 14th seat.
Zaha found the net mosquitoes only once from the mid - December to the end of the period with a long - shot loss against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had asked for sale last summer when he tried to get rid of the company, but there was no offer to tempt Palace to sell.
Zaha changed the agent in January, that it seems to be more likely to get out of the company, and in the next few weeks, he will without doubt have priority to ensure social change.
Zaha is the player who played most of the minutes in the English electoral department for Palace during the period and was the only player of the team under the age of 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much reconstruction in the team might be necessary to attack with the funds provided for the player.
Hanna: The Coronal Virus-Suppressed Texas State faces a high risk of disaster flows in a “two-two-shells”
In southern Texas, weather - news people have foretold “through floods ” after Hanna had arrived twice to the country and resulted in high rains and wind intensity up to 40 feet [40 m] per second.
When he reached a beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first stage storm (the lowest score of a five-level scale), and he has now been moved down into a hot storm, but rain could still study 150-300 mm on Sunday, and winds could reach 26 meters per second.
In some areas rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including Cameron County at the border of Mexico.
Hanna was the first orbital period in the Atlantic Sea in 2020, and the weatherologist Chris Birchfield advised the people to be careful: “This is not nearly finished yet, we still have the expectation of disasters. ”
The last few weeks, Texas has experienced a great increase in crown virus meat.
The governor Greg Abbott issued an announcement for 23 districts on the road of the storm, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All the obstacles are a huge challenge.
This challenge is complicated and even harder as the fellibyl passes through areas that have become the worst outdoors due to COVID-19," said Greg.
The pelvis came first to land at 17:00 on Saturday, 24 miles north of Port Mansfield, which is about 210 miles south of Corpus Christ.
The second time wasn't far away, in the eastern part of Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in South Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were free of electricity on Saturday evening.
In Corpus Christ’s Emergency Service, a garden near gates set up to enable them to be used if the streets were overflowing.
President Donald Trump said in tentatively that the governments were watching Hanna and Douglas, who went towards Havai in the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives at the beach of Corpus Christ, said that the storm approaching had increased the anxiety that she felt because of the world’s age.
This 67 - year - old woman had been at home for health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “This is almost as a double strike for us.
I think many have become weak.
We'll get through this.
They are all good and strong and stand together."
Heaviness of a Flowering Sealing in Southern
In some cases, the weather has been unusually good for farmers.
Most are finished with the first slide, another slide is widely started, and it is expected that some of them reach the third slide at the end of the summer.
The weather has played with southern farmers, like other residents of the country in summer, and does not corrupt the spread on the towns of farmers.
Thus, audience has worked well.
The victory of August's son, the cowboon of Birtingaholte, and a physician's worker, is happy and happy.
“ Yes, it’s just been awesome, I think the farmer must just be broken, it’s been a good walk, because the last half of the month’s weather has been very good.
Hey, the very good end of the harvest is good, and the quality of the hooks is fine all over," says Victory.
The victory says that the growth, especially in the cowboys, is growing in flat tombs or outdoors, which have been very well - given, but it is long to do the most in rollerheartedness.
“ It is vital, yes, yes, it has actually been very comfortable now in the last half of the month or three weeks, it has been so dry and good, and then it is so comfortable to deal with it.
It remembers everything, it's less stress and can be stored for the morning sometimes what could be done today, so it's excellent comfortable.
But does the winner think that some farmers will hit three times?
“ Yes, I could believe it, the first ones.
We started on June 17th, it could be that the first ones have to take three times."
Preliminary solution in the wolves - how they prevent the injury
The mayor Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English department, is an enormous fast player.
His opponents have meant to grab him in order to make sure that he can’t survive them.
This has resulted in his shoulder dropping out several times, but now the wolves have solved the problem.
The Sun reports about this.
In the game of Wolves against Crystal Palace, the nurse could see something on the shoulders of Traoré.
“ This is something we had to do in order to protect Traoré, ” says a author in Wolves, but what was being carried on it was child oil.
“ Making him a dragon makes defendants more difficult to grab him, so we can prevent further injury. ”
His shoulder Traoré first dropped off when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has dropped out of the team four times, now last against Sheffield United earlier this month.
News of Harry Englandsprince: A friend of the Duchess of Sussex objects to claims in a new book that has been between the dentists of people
Stott, in a conversation with Sky News, said that the content of the book of Harry and Meghan Markle was in no way different from the material of the sladder magazines, the only difference was that the book was integrated.
The former soldier wants seas to be increasingly directed to the positiveness that their couple have done, such as their good - doing work.
Stott said: “I feel that what is said there is no different from what we read in the leaflets, except now only in an inline book. ”
“There is a historian who tells us, but there is no doubt that this is from them. ”
“I just think this is just one more attack on them, just like the sladder magazines that persecute them.”
“ I realize that they are in the field light and people want to know what they are doing, but I wish it would be more discussed about all the good things they have done and their good - doing work, rather than their personal affairs. ”
“They, of course, never get rid of it, because of their position. ”
The support of the Duchess and the Duchess of Sussex shaded the other members of the king’s family, according to an expert in the history of the king’s family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the king’s family had not been able to use the stars of prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
So she added that the rulership of the king’s family was fixed, but that the importance of the public’s interest could not be controlled.
She also said: “The fact is that everything they did to support the queen was inclined to shade other members of the king’s family, and this was considered to be a problem. ”
"They're very popular."
“ They had less wedding than most of the sisters in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“But although Harry and Meghan had a wedding of less than Vilhelmi and Kathrina, then news transfer was the same because of the world’s great interest in the pair. ”
Donald Trump admits that he often looks after his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has admitted that he often looks after his records on Twitter that are fighting.
At a Friday interview with Barstool Sports, the President of the United States told him that his unexperienced reproductions on Twitter items — some of them contain material from the white races — were the most difficult.
When the journalist Dave Portnoy asked him whether he was looking for his items, Trump answered: “Several, too often.
It was so in ancient days, before this came, that you wrote letters and said that this letter was very large.
You put it on your desk, and then you came back the next day and said, “Oh, how glad I am not sending this, right?
But we won't do it with Twitter.
We send it out immediately, we feel great, and then you start getting a call — “Do you really say this? ”
I say, "What's wrong with this?" and you'll find various things."
In the last month, Trump caused a great anger after returning an entry (part from another account) with a video video of his supporters in the Villages area in Florida, where an old couple called “White Power” or“ the Power of Whites”.
And in 2017, Trump released three entries directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, the leader of the Great Britain First.
The President told Portnoy that the reproductions that would have brought him into the most trouble
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t investigate it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what’s on your helmets, which is small and you don’t grow it, sometimes — I’ve found that almost always the reproductions are coming into trouble. ”
The president often shares commendation for himself, voice of his opponents and conspiracy doctrines with 80 million of his followers on Twitter.
Trump says that Twitter helps him to get through the so - called “false news ” in television programs and newspapers that he says unfairly.
But the President's own lies have often been ratified under his little sight, and now Twitter means Trump's entries as a misleader.
The GPS system may be unsafe
Many countries are working on creating other location techniques than the GPS system.
Engineer says that a reason may be to worry about the security of the GPS system, which is owned by the U.S. Army.
The old Loran system has been renewing life days.
The GPS technology will follow us every footage.
We use it when we fly, sail, and drive, by landing, in industry, and holiday hours.
Most do not think that it is a military instrument in the possession of the U.S. Army, which opened it first for general use in the 1980 ’ s.
The GPS technology uses coordinates from a satellite at 20.000 miles [20.000 km] height above the ground, so conditions in nature have little effect on it.
“ But it’s very easy to disturb it.
And unwanted people can easily interfere with the reception of these signs," says Sammunter E. Thorsteinsson, professor of engineering at the University of Iceland and expert on risk management and security issues of communication.
He also makes it easy to send wrong - position error marks, for example in warfare.
“ The GPS system is owned by the US Defense Ministry.
They have assured the public that the system is ready at all times.
But surely they can turn this off if it pushed into the head of a very special president to make such a thing, then he could expect to do it," says Sander.
Thus, many countries have taken into account other systems and location techniques.
The Russians and China’s own satellite systems, and the European Union is exploding the Galilei Location System.
“ The Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may have more precision and is naturally under the rule of the European Union.
Then it is not the only government that rules it completely, but many,” says Severity.
But many too have looked back to the old loran technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the 1960s until the GPS technology took over.
The Loran marks are sent on very long waves from sent down to the earth.
“ It is then a new version of the Loran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, people are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a system of protection, because it seems to be some other laws to disturb it, it is much harder than interfering with satellite systems, ” says Sandmund.
However, it is probably safest to have access to most location systems.
Experienced Sergeant Vern Buchanan’s employee killed by the Crown Virus
“Gary was a professional in the old finger and a faithful servant of the public, ” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched the lives of so many, and he was loved and delighted by those who knew him.
I will never forget how encouraging he was, the sense of humor, and the more sober joy he received from helping others."
Buchanan’s office published a statement ten years earlier in the month, where it found that Tibbetts had no recent contact with others in the office.
Tibbett, who worked outside the office, had worked for Buchanan from 2011.
From the beginning of the world’s epidemic, more than 41.200 in New York, has reported 414.511 cases.
The state’s health authorities’ data show that hospitalisations have increased by 79% from the American National Festival of 4 July.
The data also show that at least 50 stations in Florida reached tolerance on Saturday.
“ We were told that this could have an effect, ” said DeSantis in June.
"At the same time, police work and reconciliation could have a reverse effect."
Flight from Hornfird to Cape Town
A Turkish dove, a roaster, a ring duve, a twin, a glitch, and the grays are among the birds that have been influencing to the country in summer.
On the site of the Southeast bird’s Survey, nearly every day, the brief news on the complexes, where they have been seen, and sometimes their generations.
They are many birds in Iceland.
To this end, you can mention the number of people who like the Facebook sites of Icelandic birds.
Members of the group are about 14.600.
There are pictures of birds, and it is evident that Iceland is dominated by good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
A brownfish son of Brynelf is one of them.
Binn, as he is called, is a staff member of the Southeast Surveillance Station and the Southeastern Natural Laboratory, and carefully monitors the lives of birds in that area.
He speaks beautifully of these animals that enrich the life in Iceland and play an important role there, and then it doesn’t matter whether the bird is a big and large robbery or a small spermbird.
The station was established in 2005 on the birthday of Helfdan Björnsohn on the Kvikkers in the Crews, with the aim of maintaining air and continuing the significant natural research that he carried out since 1940.
“ Half - day was thirteen years old when he began to wear information about birds, ” says Brynjulf in a conversation with the Kernel.
“We at the bird inspection station are not doing exactly the same as Halfdán did, but are building on its data by counting and marking birds. ”
Half - dán was a farmer and a general scientist, born on March 14, 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles on plants, insects, and birds.
He died February 10, 2017, almost nineth.
Half - dead and his brothers in the Cicurs were interested in many people who met them in the Icelandic nature.
In that group, Björn is Gisli Arnarson, “the employee” of the disciplinary inspection station.
A bear grew up in the Sanhedrin in the Southern Federation, and he received abundant natural punishments with his neighbors, Half - Danish on the Wickers.
But what is it that the Observatory in Southeast is doing?
About March 20, each year, the fugitive inspection station sets up a special bird anet in Einarschandi, a wooden dose within the Hornfird Cape.
There are standard labels for the birds that come into the nets.
The networks are taken down around May 10, when the casting time begins.
The networks are up every day, at least about six o'clock in the morning, and until noon.
And they need to visit every hour.
The birds that come into them are marked, measured, and then released into freedom.
Every hour, a newspaper asks a wonder.
“ Yes, we share this with us, me and Bosse.
Since we need to work for ourselves now, this can be a lot of play, but somehow we can do this," says Brynjulf.
The networks are then restored from the period of August 1 to November 10 — every day the weather permits.
Between watching the nets and during the periods that they are not upside down, Björn and Björn are marking crowns, foams, and various mosquitoes where they reach them.
In addition, they take on various special tasks.
One of these tasks is working in collaboration with the Icelandic Institute of Natural Science and is about gathering forest millets of birds.
“ The forest birds are jumping on their winter stations and then bring them to the land of the spring.
This happens shortly before they start, so they are not large when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps out of the bird and tries to find another house when he needs it."
But it's enough for a mile.
Asked about how the birds in the southeastern country have this summer, Brynjulf says that the castle seems to go well — over her head.
“ Most of the warp here is at Hala in the Southern Federation, where everything goes well.
But there is nothing more to find at Jack's Arle, where a few years ago was a huge cast."
He says that a few years ago, there were over a thousand crowns, but now they can be counted on the fingers of another hand.
“When we look at mo- and wavy birds, I think it's reduced the last few years what you find from them.
But, of course, there's always a change between years."
According to Brynjólf, what can explain the great change is most likely about food supply.
"It's all about food."
Then humans can also have their work to say about the offspring of birds and other animals.
Yet, some birds seem to have it very good in the southeastern country this summer.
“ One of the positive things that I feel is to cook is to grow again after great humiliation, ” says Brynjulf, “but during the last few years and decades the clouds have slowed down. ”
Of spoils, it is to hear that the marijuana seems to go well in its castle in some summers like in the past.
Forest thrills and ducks had decreased slightly, but Brynjulf says that it is not evident until autumn how this summer proved to them.
But let's turn to the complications.
They often raise great attention, especially if they are very invisible and even colorful.
These two remarkable factors are one of the most popular complications of the summer: the Rosar Star.
“ Another has been relatively calm in summers in the complications, ” says Brynjulf, but says that in the countryside there is now a crystal, and then circle doves have seen and are beginning to cultivate here.
When Brynjulfs and Björn come in brighter at complications, they also mark them, like other birds.
Significants are international, and they are active worldwide.
The meanings, such as the bird’s winter stations, where they paint, and what routes they are, are different.
“ You can even see how long they are on a flight, ” says Brynjulf.
This information is useful in many ways, for example, in the form of bird flocks.
“ Knowledge is always being increased. ”
If someone in the world finds a bird marked by the Southeastern Survey Station, the information is sent to the Icelandic Nature Agency.
“We have been recovered from Cape Town in South Africa.
There we found a crown that we had marked.
One crown of us found later in the United States."
One bird is Brynjulf's special sense, and it's the foam.
“ The bird is our bird, ” he says, “and pointes out that the fugitive inspection station and its Southeastern Nature station are the task of watching his offspring — which has become a lot of relaxation, and now he has come on a wagon.
It is difficult to declare what caused a collapse in the foundation, but one doctrine is that the foam has made a maritime catch that was previously passed by fishing boats and in the sea good than that it has now been used much better and affects the forests.
Are you at the best place in the land to watch birds?
“ Of course, you don’t get me to say no, ” says Brynjulf laughing, adding: “When we are also pursuing birds, we must probably go abroad. ”
Of course, the southeastern country is special when bird life comes.
“ This area is as if moved into the land from Europe, but then the birds are spread out of here.
It is very interesting to look at birds and birds, but there is less of birds than elsewhere in the country.
It isn't far from ferie and to shrimp, so that the area that such a thing suits well for the examination of birds."
But do you have a favorite bird?
He thinks about a short time before he answers.
I think the question is hard.
“ My bowl is my bird, and I have found nine of the ten who have seen the land, ” he finally answers.
“ I find it most fun now to take pictures of horse stories.
It's always nice to find birds that have not seen before in this country or are rare, so I'm not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But both of them have done so.
If you want to monitor the work of Binna and Bössa at the Southeastern Fugate Survey, you can monitor their work on Facebook and on the web of Vogler.is.
Saudi Arabia – The Sunshore of the Future? No alcohol or bikini
In recent years, the tourist industry has grown enormously much around the world, and now the authorities of Saudi Arabia want to get their cookie cut off.
The governments are likely to be destroyed, corresponding to some $60,000 billion of island crowns for the creation of a tourist paradise in the country.
The Guardian explains this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the way that Iceland is to be used in southern Europe.
There will be no alcohol available, and women will not be allowed to sunset in bikinium.
How, then, should travelers be attracted to this strongly believed Islamic country?
For example, by building a new city where there will be white beaches, moons (made of humans), drone cars, and robots serving people.
The Guardian says that it's Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prins Sádi-Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money is going to be fetched in the country’s oiled.
The crown prince says that it is not a matter of discussion that women can release to cover their shoulders and knees in public places but admits that it is not a simple matter to create a tourist paradise in the country, because it is too hot where the sun is high and cannot be trusted in wind cooling.
However, it can be wondered if it does not also reduce the interest of future tourists if they cannot buy alcohol.
Francois Bozize, who was previously swallowed by the Central African Presidency Assembly, announced a presidency procurement
The former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been stolen, announced on Saturday that he would offer himself in the presidential elections in December, despite the United Nations, that he would take criminal action and that a arrest order was issued because of his injurious crimes against mankind.
He announced his presentation in a talk before a large group of supporters in his group’s assembly, Kwa na Kwa (“work, only work”), in the capital of Bangui.
This 73 - year - old former general and soldier was exiled in 2013 in the rebellion of the alliance of the largest Muslim rebels from the north, who poured the nation, mostly for Christianity, into an overwhelming civil war and a serious and long - lasting human race crisis.
“The country needs a person with experience, peace and conviction,” said Bozize in a speech that was criticized by the current President's office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first began to be elected after power robbery in 2003 and took a presidential office for 10 years before fleeing the country in 2013.
The new government was trying to arrest him for the alleged crime against mankind and for the encouragement of national murder, but he has not been arrested since he returned from exile late year.
It is unclear how the arrest order or foreign penalties affect his offer.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to reject the penalties imposed in 2014 for the purpose of supporting armed Christian groups of Anti-Balaka.
Touadera today operates the country with the support of the United Nations' extensive peacekeeping, which counts more than 13,000 soldiers and police officers.
He was elected in 2016, and he is expected to offer himself for another period of time, but his offer has not been confirmed.
The first round of the elections will be December 27th.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace meeting with 14 armed groups who generally claim to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violent crimes have decreased, but there are still bloody incidents usually due to conflicts with resources, but the majority of this dementic country are not under the government.
Violence has taken over 1.5 million people to flee their homes.
The status of Gareth Bale at Real Madrid is “unacceptable to everyone,” says Toni Kros
Toni Kros, center of Real Madrid, says that the position of Gareth Bale at the Spanish team is “inconsistent for everyone. ”
Bale didn't participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he took a little part in the LaLiga joy of Los Blancos, and now in summer he has come up the patting position that the player is supposed to hold still before and let his contract run out, but the company hopes he disappears.
“ There is no way to avoid unacceptable situations for everyone, ” said Kros in Lauschan attack Endlich was mit Sport.
“ He was not bought to play as little as it is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company really said "yes" but so said "no" later.
I don't know if he's still a little angry about it.
When he was asked whether the circumstances had been negative in real atmosphere, Kros said: “Not as much as possible.
I've known him for six years and we've worked a lot of things together."
Chinese give Reykjanesbide 2,000 facial masks to support the fight against the crown virus
Shipping Mr. Chinees, Jin Zhijian, delivered the city leader of Reykjan’s town two thousand face masks last week.
The reason was the visit of the city manager to the Chinese ambassador last July 22th.
The weekly news first reported.
The city manager’s visit was to reimburse the visit of the Chinese ambassador in the town of Reykjanes, where he visited the council and met with the city manager.
Reports of Viktor News show that it was discussed to strengthen a friendship between the towns of Reykjan and the city of Xianyang, whereby the local communities started their cooperation between 2014.
The gift, 2,000 face masks, is to be found in this venue cooperation, but the city authorities in Xianyang wanted to give masks and thus support the struggle with the crown virus age.
In the news of the Week News, the masks will be used in sensitive agencies and offices of the Smoking towns for both employees and other guests coming there.
In addition to the flag of Iceland and the People’s Empire of China, the inscription of the face mask box, which says: “Each man is behind, unless a brother does. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Expected to lower wages
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to get home to Denmark, from the Icelandic Champion KR, for the next month, and says they are interested in the Danish 1st department.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and became Iceland Champion with both Val and KR.
However, this 27 - year - old visitor claims to be missing Denmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania Jacob’s daughter.
The Danish agreement with KR is valid until the end of this season, so it is clear that the Danish community must negotiate with KR on a purchase price in order to get it in August, before a new season begins in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would have to wait until winter by coming to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know the Danish branches start again at the end of August.
It means, of course, that I have to break my contract with KR-inga, but I have told them that I miss Denmark, and they have a full understanding of it," said Thomsen to bold.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with a trainer of Rune Christnsson, who had been fully understanding, and Thomsen said not to believe that the purchase price would be a great problem.
“ I have also had conversations with two first branches after the completion of the department, and then I knew where they would end.
There has already been a little interest in the coming period, so it may well be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic department ends," said Thomsen, adding that it was clear that there were not many companies in Denmark who could buy up his contract with KR.
“ This is not quite clear now, but it has been interesting.
I also need to find the best opportunity for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen, and he asked to look first and foremost to the Copenhagen.
Thomsen said KR-inga don't have to worry about that he didn't give himself all the exercises and games, although he missed Denmark.
“ Kr knows what it gets from me, and it is that I do things 100 percent.
I can look completely beyond because I miss Denmark when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who says that he's going to lower the salary of leaving the Iceland Champions in the next department of Denmark.
“ I will probably have to lower only in wages, because of the crown virus crisis that seems to have hurt the Danish companions only more than they are in the Icelandic.
But I am also studying, and one solution could be that a company provided me with a job.
The majority of the companies in Section 1 are agreed with a supporter.
I'm learning sports management through the players' organizations and finishing the bachelor grade," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been at the start team of KR in two games in the Pepsi Max division in this season, but has a story in five games and scored one point.
He started 21 games in the past and scored seven limits.
KR is equal to Choice at the top of the Pepsi Max division and plays for good, but the team meets KA on Akureyri today.
Taken on the crown virus on board a bus when a driver lands in a hot rifle about face masks
The tape shows passengers and drivers on board a Arriva street truck in Liverpool dealing with mask use.
The driver hears explain to a woman that it is not in his work ring to tell passengers to use a mask.
The chief said: “It’s not in my business to tell everyone who steps up in the car to use a mask. ”
“ A man and an older woman began to give her, and a lot of dispute broke out. ”
“ The chief had to leave her seat and came to ask what was actually going on, and he told one woman that she was not even using the mask right. ”
“The woman then ran away from the wagon and said she was going to report the incident. ”
A spokesman Arriva said: “The security of our clients and employees is as a priority as before.
“Our clients are, like, obliged to use masks when they use public transport (exceptions apply).”
“Reduce instructions and labels for customers on this, and all other distance rules are on board on the roads, on social media and on our websites.”
A mask family has been in force in public transport since June 15th.

Octavia Spencer calls for Hollywood to advise people with disabilities more often in role
The gamer is involved in a new effort to increase the involvement of people with disabilities in the entertainment sector.
The effort is underway at the same time as 30 years have passed from the American laws on the rights of people with disabilities, which occur on Sunday.
In the video, Spencer discusses the importance of seeing itself and their life reflected in a real way on the screen.
“ Nothing can replace personal experience and real displays, ” she says.
“This is why it is so important to employ appropriate actors in an appropriate role.”
Spencer discussed the effect she had of seeing skin - dark people on the screen when she was a little girl watching the feature “Good Times. ”
Norman Lear made the awards shown at CBS in 1974 to 1979, and they used the way to be the first cowards that showed two parents of both African origins.
An association against hunger pushes Yoho to the side after events in the Congress
WASHINGTON (AP) – regardless of the Christian organization that wants to end hunger on Saturday, they said that they had asked the senator Ted Yoho to declare himself from the government of the congresses, and that he had come to it after what they called the "attack" of the Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Democrata in New York, accused Yoho, the Senator of the Repubics in Florida, of using a low-court and male arrogance when he deceived her when they met the steps of the Congress House last Monday.
Yoho argued that he had not used the words quoted to, but a reporter who witnessed the incident confirmed that the word was as she described it.
Bread for the World stated that the government of the congregation had met Yoho on Friday and sought that he said to “justify our commitment to standing with women and skin - dark people, both in the country and in the world, leading us to the world by increasing participation of all races and increased justice. ”
On the Bread for the World web page, their “common Christian voice ” pressed the assembly and governments to end hunger in the land and worldwide.
“ Since Bread for the World is independent of a Christian organization that aims to reduce hunger and poverty with trusted official policies, the organization keeps the respect, dignity, and care that Jesus asks us to show when we are in contact with people in power, wherever it is in the political colors, ” states the statement.
“ Our assessment reflects recent activities and words of the senator Ted Yoho, reported in the media, not the moral requirements made for our government members. ”
In the work of the news, Yoho’s speaker had not answered an e - mail with an invitation to respond.
In an incredible speech in the Chamber last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez dramatically said of the event and directed her words against what she called a man’s brake teaching that “accepts violence and a violent speech against women. ”
More than a decade of her coworkers accepted her words that the incident was an example of too common behavior of men.
Yoho described the event as a short discussion on policy issues and “no one had been annoyed, polluted or attacked. ”
He said that he regreted that he had shown “convenience of harshness. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is a senior congressman, who has received both praise and burden for her cleansing.
The 65 - year - old Yoho is one of the most conservatives of the Congress, and he will sit down in a holy stone at the end of his fourth season.
Wait until the 98th minute in the locale by scoreing the first target of the period
Jesse Lingard had not scored or put up in the English electoral department in this season until he hit Leicester today in the 98th minute of the final circuit.
Lingard had not scored in the English selection department since he scored two times against Cardiff in December 2018.
He arrived today as a spareman for Manchester United when Leicester came in a final game of the Master’s District.
In more than seven minutes, Lingard’s normal playtime, Kasper Schmeichel’s targetman Leicester’s bolt, scored to the empty target.
Jesse Lingard's long-term target.
Real Madrid players exempted the rules on a famine
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to come to England in their second game at Manchester City, the Master’s Division of Europe, without having to go for two weeks.
British governments have decided that travelers from Spain need to go into two weeks of congestion to stop the spread of the crown virus.
However, there are exceptions, such as in the case of competitions at the highest level of sport.
This confirmed a Ministry of Sports at Sky Sports.
The Ministry says that individuals who are excluded from the rules will only be in delimited areas, before smelled doors.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and media.
Thus, the Madridians can meet Manchester City on August 7, without having to stay long in England, which is 2 to 1 down in the enemy after losing in Santiago Bernabea on February 26th.
The victory team will go on to the 8th final of the Portuguese.
Degradation and depletion of the land of the sales saints
The news of overwhelming hotels and tents to judge, in the least south, is clear that the Icelandians have been busy travelling in the country this summer.
If those who have landed under the feet have also been lucky with the weather and the weather contradictor DV in one case that the summer was just a nice statement, at least here.
But now there is a commercial saint that has been the largest tour saint in the year.
However, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared with other weekends, because events that in the usual year have attracted a large number of people to not be held.
For example, there is enough to mention a national festival.
The weather will, of course, play a major role, but it is now an appearance of decay raining throughout the country, but especially south and southwest.
The weatherroom predicts a rainfall from Thursday evening and at least until Saturday evening.
For example, long - term prophecy is not a sacred truth here on the northern Atlantic and can certainly change.
In his prophecy on his weather, Blika, the weather scholar called Einar Sweibjørnsson, says that it is humiliated to expect the sales saints.
Says he: In the elevators with a belonging cold that too often reaches down to the surface, when warm air from the southwest tries to approach only with wind and evacuation.
Surely also warmer airs that are “invaded” here in the north.
One presents its prophecy card to support, saying: “A small wave from America is fighting to the east and with it a summer - sound air.
When she approaches, she approaches “blome” in the form of lower air pressure and considerable summer.
The Great Prophecy, the European Calculation Centre on the Left of the Map, and the United States GFS prophecy on the right, are quite consistent with this development.
Consideration of the humiliation, see the prophecy passing late on Thursday and early on Friday with the hot A-tight and rain on most of the whole land.
Afterwards, the center of 985 hPa is followed.
This time, some warm air on Northern and Easternland is followed by Saturday and even Sunday.
On the other hand, it could blow.

Followed a actress from Law and Order all the way to New York
“ I was shot in her as if a man gets such a youth shot, ” says Birna Renn Björn’s daughter about Marisku Hargitay, the main actress of the elements Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was so mountained by the actress that she was able to take the plays and wait for her hours together, just to say hello.
When Birna Pure Björn’s daughter, the owner of the Pink Iceland Travel Office, looked like many Icelandians looked at the tensions Law and Order: Special Victims Unit from the centuries, she was a coal for the main players of Marisku Hargitay.
Birna explains the story of her meetings and the actress in the Edition of Love Stories at Channel 1.
When Birna was a teenager, at the age many begin to develop an excessive love, she did not experience it as her peers, for she was stricken to defend her own teachings.
She thought she was interested in boy - sound teams and young magnificent cinemas from movies but did not have it at all.
“ I was cutting pops and hanging pictures on the wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just me hiding that I was a lesbian."
She says sometimes that when people get out of the safe, they will pass through a late gellow.
“ We spend our teenage years on depressing these youth impulses, these shots, and so on.
I think it was one of the things that attracted me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something with her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot in her shoe."
It runs on the rack of the actress when she was supported in New York a few years ago.
One of her best friends, Erling Ottar Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie in the city, and he received Birna and their friend, Gunnar Holy Son of Godjón, to help with the takings.
“ We were working in 30 people and spending time with strangers.
This is naturally an intimate atmosphere when you spend so long time together a day so it was talked about everything and nothing."
One day, Birna is a great fan of Marisku.
One woman in the show team tells her friend to know the actress because he was in the play team.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friends like to work with her actress and whether Birna could get to meet her.
“ She tells me to stop this, she doesn’t know if she can let it happen, ” says Birna.
When the movie is finally finished, the group will try to convince the woman to try to get around the meeting for the last time, and Birna will try to convince her.
“She had got some bottles and said she would just grab this.”
A few days later, Birna sends a message to the woman and asks if something is happening.
The woman doesn't respond, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she will wake up with a long - long message.
“ I look at the phone and cry upward.
Gunnar Helgi wake up by crying, and I say, I have to go to the shower, and I have to make myself fine, and go down to a city."
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors, and the actors of Law and Order were supported on a hotel at the Times Square.
“ I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, you’re doing well, ” says the message and Birna dresses herself closely, asking at the reception where to take the lift up to the 45th elevation where the group is together.
Birna comes and waits until a woman in the staff comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if it can help.
“ I say I'm looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland had come. ”
When the friend finally comes, he looks impressed at Birna and asks how she really came to the end to be strict security.
Birna explains that she has just taken the lift and asks for a meeting with Marisku.
“ Yes, I don't know.
Sit down here," says the friend, and Birna counts.
With her side, there's an extra player in the factors, and they start talking together.
“ I say to him, ‘ I am a fan, but you? ’ says Birna.
“I played this as if this was the most normal thing in the world.”
It's time and Birna's waiting.
The players appear regularly when a break is made, they get talk, and Birna looks around and seeks Marisku, which is not visible.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her he's sad to leave.
Birna asks him to get in the hands of another employee, since she did not know that she was going anything right away.
Amazingly, the friend accepts it and reaches another employee.
“He comes with his other friend and says, “This is the woman from Iceland who really wants to meet Marisku. ”
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours of waiting, the new friend comes running to Birna.
“ He says, Quick.
These are unusual circumstances today, there are journalists with her so she won't stop anything.
She's going straight into a car with them so you'll have to take the chance and go down and find her wheelchair.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
“So I look at the right and lose my face” Birna goes on and takes the elevator down to the Times Square.
There she finds about forty wheelchairs, some marked and some do not.
On the other hand, Marisku’s bicycle does not find her, and then it becomes desperate.
“ I feel the bulb poured over me because I had spent half a day on this, but I think so well, I tried.
It was fun."
Ondop keeps Birna back to the hotel where she sees the window, watching herself with gracious eyes, realized that Birna was unable to do her purpose.
Birna is accepting the destiny, and it begins to rain.
“ I go under a shelf to protect myself from the rain.
Then I look right, and I lose my face."
Nobody but Mariska Hargitay stood there in her pants dress, and Birna knew well — but Birna could hardly move by mental agitation.
“ I look at my body and my hands and think now you have to move.
Now you have to go towards her."
Birna does it and recalls to pitch the shoulder on the actress.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I'll just say hello, "Birna's screwing up.
“ I say I am from Iceland and a great fan.
She says, "That's nice to meet you."
The conversation did not go far further because Marisku’s car is coming, and it’s whispered on it.
Mariska turns to Birna and says: “I have to go, but it was really nice to meet you. ”
Björna greets the religious god, watchs the car drive away and then breaks together.
“ I call a cooker in Erling and Gunna, and they thought this wouldn’t have succeeded.
But I was crying of excitement and joy.
I say, yes, I'll meet her. You have to meet me now.
And then we poured into soda water and tequila," says Birna.
She doesn't regret anything, though she admits that she probably wouldn't repeat the game.
“ It’s like once in your life, offering such time and energy in making such a thing happen.
But I'll always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Birna Purna Björn's daughter in the spectrum of Strong Stories at Channel 1.
Police does not spread the virus
There is no reason to be worried that the crown virus can be supplied with alcoholisms used by the police.
This is what a police officer in the headquarters’ traffic department says in a conversation with mbl.is.
Indications have been given from people who are worried that the same mouthpiece is used for all drivers when the police enters, is on a traffic street and leaves everyone who has a way to blow.
The police, however, say the fullest of cleanliness.
“ It is not really a special mouthpiece, but we recommend cups that people are blowing into, ” says a policeman.
“Some people want to put their lips on this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, up to a few thousand centuries. ”
Asking if it seems sufficiently distanced, the police say so.
If you prove to be positive, then the police will be used to another measure.
It has a mouthpiece, which comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
Abdominal abdominal disorders: Among other things, anicine can be incorporated to reduce pain
The relationship with depression is not random.
Individuals suffering from infantitis, which is a disease characterised by abdominal pain, cramps, temperament, wind turbulence, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening of symptoms under the American Anxiety and Depression Association (ADAA).
“This is because the shrimp is partly controlled by the nervous system that responds to stress,” ADAA explains.
If the subject does not decrease, food intolerance may be considered.
Judge attempts to stop the decision that children will be released from the immigration day authority
In his decision on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee invalidated the expected time limit by saying that the immigration and customs authorities in the United States do not need to leave children free if it is not possible to do so with any of the three ways described in its previous order.
However, Gee also emphasized it in its order that importers and customs authorities still have the obligation to release their children without unnecessary need.
The three paths that Gee planned are to free families held by immigrants and customs authorities, to put children in the hands of a responsible man, or to release families to a federal judgment.
Shalyn Fluharty, the head of the Agency's Proyecto Dilley, who provides families with a legal service, condemned the decision and told her to put it in hand to the immigrant and customs authorities to decide whether to continue to have children.
“The main thing I think is that children are kept in the prison indecently and they are not released unless the immigration and customs authorities agree to it or families agree to break up,” said Fluharty.
Family is held at three locations of importers and customs authorities in Berks, Pennsylvania, South Texas (Dilley) and the Karnes County in Texas.
Children in these places are aged 1 to 17 years of age, according to lawyers and representatives.
In June, Gee, who is supervised by the implementation of the Flores Convention on the Care of Children, said that, as “the rules on mask use and social distinguishment are not or are not followed,” it would be urgent to move children from these stations.
969 people in the immigration and customs authorities have been identified with the crown virus and are isolated or monitored from 23 July, according to the immigration and customs authorities.
Of these, 25 cases are confirmed in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in the Main Centers for Families.
Over 3700 cases have been confirmed in preservation

After Icelandair interacted with the Iceland Airlines and cancelled all airlines, VR declared that directors appointed by VR under the management of the Icelandair Lifeyris Fund or paid voting against the participation of the Icelandair Icelandair Icelandair Award.
Ragnar Tor Ingolfsson, president VR, continued to say that if they did not come to the recommendations, governments would be replaced.
Ragnar Tor reversed his statement three days later, as was the government of VR.
Assger Jonsson, banking director, said in the news of the RUFV on Friday, to ensure the autonomy of the governors of the grants in the appropriations and possibly by legislative changes.
Catherine Jacob’s daughter says that the rulers of the ancestors are independent, but they are already considered to be secured by law.
“The banking director, of course, has said that if something needs to go over there, it is a need to look at the regulations in particular around this independence, we will of course consider it.”
Katrin says that according to the laws, lifekeeping funds set moral standards in their investment policy.
It would prefer to discuss the social and moral standards they want to emphasise in their investments.
“ I did not think anything abnormally, likewise, that lifekeeping funds also set the standard in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
But I think that such decisions are taken through policy, not through individual investment decisions," says Katrin.

There are long prayers, sometimes quite up to the Hellisheed for those who want to get here on their way east to land and those coming westwards, so it gives an eye that we need to get a new bridge and not later than yesterday,” says Helgi S. Haraldsson, President of the city's government in Árburg.
According to weekends, the city authorities in Årburg recently held a meeting with the Chief of the Road Act and the design of the Roadmap, and that meeting was very positive.
“If you have ever been optimistic about working in these matters, I think I can say it now because it is really working in this, and we should be able to see that a new bridge will be invited out to autumn. ”
But is there any advice for the drivers who are waiting for the Elfth Year Bridge all days over the summer?
“Yes, it is possible to go through the eagle and through the Eagle, but the eastern ones, it is not possible to indicate that they are going to the Leagues, but those who are going to the Orchards should use Mosfellsheeds, Constituents and Weight Heeds. ”
The Holy S. Haraldson, President of the City of Aarborg, who says the traffic tape, forming at the Elfth Year Break at Selfoss insisting.
A long prayer forms every day at the Elf - year bridge, and drivers often have to wait for a lot of time to get over the bridge.
The only advice is to breathe deeply and to think positively.
The future of the Cole Bears in the north of Brisbane is before organizational judgment
In addition to the vital home of the coal bears, the sweats, and the gray shark, it would be an important link between the natural areas of Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
Commissioners have prompted the rejection of civil governments to the Court of Justice of Organization and the Environment, by reason of the fact that the construction is in accordance with the Urban Organization Act from 2014, would meet the organizational and social needs that have not been met to this end and will be "indispensable".
There is a great opposition to these planned executions in the neighborhood.
The executives argue that, despite the complete conformity of the proposal, it could be changed if it did not meet requirements, rather than reject it.
As it is, the conduct includes many stages, including a service station, childcare, and 39 housing houses.
Public missions were more than 120 at the time of consultation, and most objected to the suggestion that it was too large and inappropriate to the area.
The leader of the Ministry of Brisbane said that the city had to buy the land to protect the coal bear.
“ Adrian Schrinner has to stop throwing taxpayers' funds in battle with the executive for judgment and buying this country to protect the nature and animal life of Brisbane,” said Cassidy.
“This is one of the most important homes of coal bears in the natural area Mountain to Mangroves, and there is a number of coal bears.”
In the week, Schrinner said that the city government wanted the home of the coal bears in the area to be protected.
“ We found the suggestion not suitable for the area, ” said Schrinner.
“ I understand that this is now going through the judgment system, and obviously, we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will preserve the homehood. ”
Schrinner said that charting on home coal bears would be the joint responsibility of the city government and government, but that the government is responsible for accurate maps of the homes of the coal bears that local authorities support when they accept applications for execution for treatment.

Vopnahlé starts at midnight in the Eastern Ukrainian War
Kiev, Ukraine — the Ukrainian army and opposition forces in the eastern Ukraine are now preparing a “general” armed gadget to begin at midnight and as representatives hope to be the first step towards peace after 6 years of conflict.
On Sunday, representatives of opposition said that they had given their soldiers orders on arms gadgets and issued a command on the prohibition of the use of weapons.
The Ukrainian army said that his army had “have prepared ” for the army.
If it is achieved, it would “take the way for the implementation of other regulations” of the Minsk peace meeting, according to the statement of the Ukrainian President's office earlier in the week, where the armament was called a time-congress screw.
The aim of the Minsk peace meeting, which was made by France and Germany in 2015, was to settle the conflict between Ukraine and the separation of Russia, which began in 2014 after Russia’s entry into the Crimean and supporting the country’s separation.
More than 14,000 people have died in the fight.
The Presidents of Russia and the Ukraine rejoiced at the phone call on Sunday and emphasised the importance of the agreement reached at the meeting in Paris in December.
Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, expressed anxiety over the call of Kiev to review the Minks meeting and said that the position of Volodimir Selenski, President of the Ukraine, on “the imchangeability of the Minsk meeting, which he still showed in this telephone, should be reflected in real operations”.
Selenski, however, stressed the need to take “more action ” to deliver the Ukrainian prisoners of rebels in East Ukraine, the embodied Crimean and Russia, according to the statement from the President’s office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only be ruled over borders with Russia in the areas of separation when they have received widespread self - control law and when elections have been held in the regions.
The meeting declined, but the Ukrainian army and rebels have continued to be shots.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December for other discussions, there was a support for the Minsk Convention and agreed to start the peace process again.
Selenski, who won the elections in 2019 by promises to end the conflict, wanted Ukraine to take over the borders before the first cruises of the region, but the Kreml governments would require the agreement to be implemented without any change.
The new arms sale meeting was reached on Wednesday by the support of a three-sided group of cooperatives appointed by the representatives of Russia and Ukraine, plus the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore delighted by EU officials.
At the traditional Sunday blessing of Peter’s store, Pope Frans also recalled the arms gap and said that “rebuilding confidence and setting the foundation for the very necessary and long - long - long peace with the people. ”

Despite the White House’s Remarks, the Wulpe team is not in danger
Yesterday, the manufacturers of the Hvolpas team did not stand to stop showing the child’s substance in the near future.
The statement follows the statement of Kayleigh McEnany, media representative of the White House, that the factors dealing with legal dogs are victims of “exclusion cultures ” (e.g. cancel culture).
Canadian producers were quickly responding to McEnany’s words and announced that their fans would not have to worry about the future of the Hvolpas.
A number of television series dealing with police work have been taken out of a show in the United States after protests against police violence.
However, the Wulpas team is not one of them, despite its vocabulary on social media.
At a newspaper meeting in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that President Trump, President of the United States, was opposed to “exclusion culture, ” especially when the police arrived.
The term refers to when comments or businesses raise hard reactions to social media and are called after the party is defected in a contradictory sense.
“ We saw it a few weeks ago that the shows of the Hvolpas team, a child’s agent, were stopped.
The same is with the factors Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego took a lawyer from sale, but no foot is for the claim, according to Lego Defense.
However, the realistic factors of Cops and Live PD have recently been taken out of a show in the western Pacific.
Both factors include the branch for showing the elements of real police tasks without allowing individuals to appear there.
Together for 29 years — Sometimes jealousy and uncertainty arise
Christian Tomas ’ daughter, a family therapeut, answers the questions of readers regarding the family, children, and love in the family corner of DV.
This time, she answers readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, have been together for 29 years and have two children.
We know nothing but to be together, and we feel well, but we both have felt as if we were missing something.
We have never been with other people and have no comparison of how this could be different.
This has sometimes caused jealousy and distrust in relation to whether the other person is looking around himself, thinking about adultery, or even divorce, and changing.
When we talk about this, we agree to cultivate our relationship, but this is such a marrow that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a great question and I am glad you have so open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking about this in each corner, you couldn't talk about this and even take any steps that you might notice later.
Everything on the top of the tables, isn't it always the best?
Strong self - image has the greatest prediction of happiness in the future and the stronger self - image you have, the more likely you have a marriage mate with a strong self - image.
Why, when youths begin, they are often growing up in each direction, but in cases where there is a more dominant effect, individuals can become stronger than many others.
Since your relationship begins to form in your greatest years of formation, you can conclude that you have grown together and have a positive effect on each other’s self - image.
We are conceived by the relationships we are in.
The way I speak is made up by how you listen.
The way I show myself depends on how you see me.
Relations form who we are.
Could you turn the example and think, what do we have that others do not have?
What does this many years give us?
I allow myself to claim that the benefits can be much more than the defects.
You have formed each other for years, and so you can say you're customized between meters each other.
That's more than many can say.
That's worth?
You are talking about the fact that you have missed something, but it is important to remind you that major changes, such as divorce and new relationships, are also following accompanying fish for which you are not necessarily excited.
You may be missing from restarting, learning to be alone again, getting to know a new person, and bringing together families.
These are following new challenges, different problems, and possibly something new and exciting.
But this is not just a pink cloud and happiness, no no, at your age, this can become a foolish complex task, which may never be as good as you have already done each other.
Is that worth it?
Would it not be recommended to focus on what you can do to increase excitement, unforeseenness, and innovations in your relationship?
You haven't put shoes on the hill.
There are so many things you can do to make this long relationship still deeper.
What experiments can you do about it?
What do you need from your spouse that you are not getting?
What can you give your spouse that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and re-define your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or alone?
Do you want to try something new?
Today, there is a considerable greater tolerance to various forms of contact, and couples are beginning to define their relationships in various ways, such as open relationships, multiassesses, or to decide to stop temporarily.
I'm not telling you what to do, even though no expert in your solutions, but perhaps it would lighten these heavy weeds that swear over you, if you look at this and think in solutions.
What do you need to be so untrusted and fear disappear?
You've been together for 29 years, it must mean that you're able to do some things together.
Use it as a strength and keep your hands in the direction of your solution.
We urge readers to send their questions and vaults to Christians by email to: hjonbandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will be answered here in the family corner, of course without name and in full faith.

“ In our last week interview with President Trump, he doubted that his opponent in the Democrata class, Joe Biden, would plumb in similar circumstances, ” said Wallace.
“ In the week, we asked Bidens’ electorate for an interview, and they said that the former President of the Deputy was not free. ”
“ We continue to ask each week, ” he added.
Trump’s cosnationateum has criticized Biden for avoiding election meetings and newspaper meetings during interviews while the crown virus age is ongoing.
Although Biden has recently restarted his electoral trip, Trump and his companions have continued to excite the former President for “hidden” at his home in Delaware.
However, Bidens’ success in meeting public events has not been fun of his offering, since the latest studies show that Biden has a good foregoing on Trump both in the country and in the main fighting countries.
The average Real Clear Politics indicates that the president was 7 percent lower in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan, and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all the four nations in 2016, when he turned them over to the Republican class when he worked the battle about the White House.
In the latest research of Fox News Poll, Biden has a foregoing in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, with no scarce limits in all cases.
Assessments also indicate that Biden has a little foregoing in Ohio, North Carolina and Arizona, three other important fighting countries in these elections.
And research suggests that the formerly trusted republics, such as Texas and Georgia, are now divided between the Trumps and the former President of the Deputy.
Presidential elections where a sitting president offers a second elective period in the White House are often voting for that president — and this seems to be the case now in the Trumps - Bidens fight in 2020.
The most important issues have been the crown virus and the economy that are depressed because of the epidemic — and the president’s performance and history in both categories of matters.
Canye West and his mood with psychiatrists
Today, the musician Canye West asked his wife, Kim Kardashian, apologize for his words that he had to fall into an awesome harvest.
The chief mental helper considers him to pick up his creative power in psychiatrists, but psychiatrists say importantly that people are taking medicines to keep the disease in harassment.
The rappar Kanye West is not just one of the most powerful musicians at the same time, but is also famous as the husband of the reality star Kim Kardashian.
His personal life has been a great deal of open tents.
When he earlier this month announced that he would be pleased to offer himself to the President of the United States, he kept the emotional force and a broken speech.
Later, on Twitter, a few extraordinary things appeared, in which he claimed that his wife was trying to put him in a hospital.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram, as she asked people to show their husband and family understanding; he had a psychiatric disease, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want himself to seek help.
Since then, he has asked her officially for apology.
This famous family is not alone in dealing with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people get psychiatric disorders.
Ferdinand Johnsson is a superior psychiatrist in London Hospital, and he knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause so decisive anxiety for individuals, especially for families and their loved ones.
This abuse, or mania, can destroy relationships and work and cause an enormous grief.
And then the other sides, the depression, it's often great danger, because it's a high frequency of suicide in that group.
So I thought it was beautiful that she said this.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
The name of Unnstein’s son, the chairman of mental helper, himself has suffered psychiatrists — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very delightful imagination.
If we are four strings of earthly contrabass, it is a hundred strings of heavenly harp.
And he is so excessively creative, excessively powerful and clear in his powerful relationship thought, because you are going to be with this connection thought that we have had to try to go into an awesome condition so well know."
Canye West doesn't want to take antipsychotics, because he thinks they're pulling his creative.
He has discussed the psychiatrists, including on the plate Ye.
It says it's his choice not to take drugs.
“ Many feel that this creative element is inherent in this unshakable connection thought and the superb creative force of the fire that it has, but then naturally the defects are often great suffering, and the valleys and dark basements and darkness. ”
Ferdinand, however, says that treatment is important to people with psychiatric disorders.
“If you have a lot of abuse or maniac, you don’t make awesome things, you’re just on the side.
And as when people get into severe depression, people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take drugs?
“ Surely, ” says Ferdinand.
“And especially to work with someone to find the right dose and this way to make it a balance between helping him as much as possible, and to destroy as it is remembered for him and his skills and his creative power. ”

"People-Sick" ambassador wants a gun, a gun guarded car, and an injecting west - Assumed to be the "deep-state"
Politically appointed American Ambassador here, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, who said he wanted to carry a shooting weapon in the CBS news today.
Starting with the CBS: “Despite being located in one of the safest states of the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter “sick ” about his security since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
CBS refers to 12 diplomatas, directors, and former representatives, as well as individuals who know the matter.
Gunter’s conclusion was to demand by the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs that they wished for a permit for the missionary to walk around armed in the country.
He should also have wished for a bridge - guard car that traveled with him between places in Iceland and the injection west.
The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to state whether any threat was the security of the missionary, but the representatives of the U.S. governments said that the missionary had been told that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
Yet, CBS says that it would have been advertised for lifeguards in the Icelandic newspapers, and if it had been a part of the missionary’s demands.
The CBS report says that the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to comment on the matter with CBS.
However, the American news station, according to its authors in the country, has no wish to come to the country’s governments.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken of walking about arms, where it would offende the hosting country, Iceland.
The consignor received his praise because he supported abundantly with Donald Trump’s Danube Chairman in the 2016 presidential elections.
Earlier, he was a skin doctor in California.
Since then Gunter began in May, when he said that he has created a “inconsistent ” environment in the ambassador and has already had seven subsidies, the Deputy Chief of Mission, subsidies of the transmitter who are also broadcasting diplomates.
Everyone tried diplomatics from the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The first one was sent away from the messenger “because he did not look at his appearance. ”
He had already prepared for a year and learned Icelandic.
The next one ended only for six months.
As a result, the people were prepared to rotate, and the idea was to make Gunter make a way as most until he looked at one of them.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was expecting the missionary’s staff to walk the matter of “the Deep Kingdom ” and to have undermined him to the Washington D.C. Foreign Ministry.
The Heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of D.C. are well aware of the situation of their missionary in Reykjavík, but have been hesitant to take the steps of the uncontrolled board in the light of Gunter’s connection to the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had a problem with following the commands of the Washington Foreign Ministry, and he was said to have refused to return to D.C. while the Covid-19 epidemic was radiating.
He left the council in the hands of his employees for months.
He said he'd work from his home in California, except as appointed by the foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Cut finally backwards
Lastly, the officer received the order, Gunter returned to Iceland in May.
His new subcontractor, Michelle Yerkin, then came to the country this month.
CBS has not received any answers to their requests to the US Foreign Ministry.
The Foreign Ministry did not want to express himself with CBS or with the DV request.
Gunter is one of the many politically commanded missionarys of the Trump Government, who has raised attention to unusual behavior in the past months.
To form, Woody Johnson raised a hard reaction when he was trying to make British open master assembly in a golf golf in Trump’s property.
The missionary in South Africa has also been proclaimed to drive his number two men and then try to place her son in the job.
42% of U.S. Ambassadors are politically appointed.
30% were politically appointed to Obama’s government, and 32% to George W. Bush.

Pole will tell itself about the European Convention on Prevention of Violence against Women
Polish judicial government says that the country will withdraw from the European Convention on Prevention of Violence against Women.
The Istanbul Convention is the first binding legislative act of the world that aims to prevent violence against women, but the Commissioner for Justice, Zbigniew Ziobro, describes the text as “injurious” as a requirement for schools to teach children about sex from a social perspective.
Ziobro said about the weekend that on Monday, he would begin to prepare a formal process for the country to declare the contract.
“This ideaological element is related to the attempts to change education in schools and leisure work, in terms of study, attitude and conviction of the young generations of Polish, from the conclusion that we believe is wrong, that biological sex is old and that everything really is about socially cultural sex.”
Ziobro considers that the provisions of the agreement on child education and young people as well as family relationships in the context of LGBT people are inappropriate.
“We also reject the LGBT factors in the discussion on family relations, because this is the view held by left activists or groups of homosexuals who want their views to become binding laws,” he said.
On Sunday, the European Council said that it would be “saving” for Poland to tell themselves about the agreement.
On Friday, Warsaw protested about 2,000 people, including groups of women and other groups of rights fighters, outside the offices of the Rights Contractors of Ordo Luris, who support the country’s declaration of the contract.
“ We will not be victims, ” they cried.
In other cities of Poland, protests also took place.
In December 2012, Poland signed the Istanbul Agreement to prevent and fight violence against women and domestic violence and executed it in 2015.
Maurice Petty, a enginemaker in the Honorary Hall, died 81
KANSAS CITY, Kansas (AP) - Maurice Petty, who was part of a quartal-migration charter that counts among other things his father Lee and his brother Richard, who was the first engineer taken into the Heidshall Nascar, died on Saturday.
He was 81 years old.
Petty's family did not give up his death cause.
It hasn't been reported about his excursion.
While other members of his family were roamed for their capabilities behind the steering, Maurice Petty won the nickname “The Governor ” for his skills with the screw key.
He helped his family work 198 racers and seven titles in the NASCAR department, and also built machines that guaranteed the Victory of Buddy Baker, Jim Paschal, and Pete Hamilton.
“ The boss was one of the most important engineers in the history of NASCAR, ” said the Chairman and CEO Jim France.
“ He came with the power that helped Petty Enterprises to achieve his excellence in the sports field.
Although Maurice was known for his work under the hat, he also took various roles behind the tents and did what needed to bring his trucks to the victory path."
Maurice Petty was born on 27 March 1939 at Level Cross in North Carolina.
He followed his father on the race track when he was small and his knowledge in the engineering soon became a vital element in landing Lee Petty victory at 54 races and three masters.
He raced 26 times in the NASCAR beaker in the years 1960 to 64, was seven times in the top five seats and 16 times in the top ten.
However, he soon decided to focus on what happens under the machine protector rather than behind the steering wheel, which proved to be a good trail for his older brother, who relyed on his machines during his victory.
Richard, who was then called the King, won the first masterater together with the Governor in 1964 with the Plymouth Library.
They conquered again in 1967, then two years in order of 1970 and 1971, and reached three additional titles before the 1980 ’ s end.
With these seven titles on the back, they share the score in the largest number of titles with Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson.
“ Mairice Petty was one of the true NASCAR pioneers and was involved in building one of the NASCAR peak teams, ” said Winston Kelley in a statement.
“ Although Petty is recorded as 212, he calls for more than 250 victories, if all the machines he built for his competitors are taken.
The manager will be remembered forever as the best machine in the history of NASCAR."
Lee Petty died in 2000, and Patricia, wife of Maurice Petty, died in 2014.
He was also the uncle of the former driver and mediaman Kyle Petty and Trent Owens, director of the pole car race.
“ Although we now say goodbye to Maurice Petty, one of the true and powerful pioneers and heroes of the NASCAR, his heritage and name will be stored in our memory, kept in the air and preserved for all the future, ” said Kelley.
"We're sending our deepest compassions to the Petty family."

President Alexander Vucic said that “a certain requests ” were ongoing to buy a fleet of battle machines, accusing the United States and other western states to have armed the neighbouring country of Serbia, which is in NATO, as well as in Cosovo, a former province of Serbia.

The main signs of cranial artery disease (including cardiac dehydration) are three: chest pain (cardiac angina), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptomatic symptoms may be cardiac stroke and severe breathing.
“Sockage contains nutrients that are good for your heart, such as flavonoid, methylxantine, polyphenol and steroid acid, which can reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol.”
Good cholesterol, also called high-intensive fituproteine, collects “low” cholesterol – the type of cholesterol that trimges the heart – and moves it into the liver.
The “low” cholesterol (low concentration fituproteine) is broken down into the liver and then distinguished from the body.
However, the new study does not determine the dose size or type of chocolate that is consumed.
It is not clear whether participants ate dark chocolate, lactose glucose, or any other chocolate.
The results were based on an older study that concluded that the use of cocoa (founded in chocolate) decreased the probability of heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoid found in chocolate lowers blood pressure and improves vascular function.
Vascular function means how well your blood distributes oxygen and nutrients through your body and transports waste.
Lifestyle factors were not identified in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said that those who had accepted to eat chocolate would be more likely to have a healthy body weight.
So she added that they could exercise regular physical activity and feel less stress.
“Every of these factors could have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system,” she added.
Coles replaces plastic toys for books in a new collection process
“ We have really listened, and it was a complete key element in the preparation of the project, ” said Ronson.
“ We do not believe that people want to recycle the books — we think it will want them, but it can recover them at home if they want to. ”
Ronson said that the new introductory campaign has been working long before COVID-19 arrived in history, and despite the danger, she believes that the date of the new campaign has been “nothing good” because of how much time parents now spend with their children.
The articles have declared concerns because consumers have become tired at the continual toy collection campaigns of the largest markets, but Ronson notes that there is no evidence of fatigue yet.
“ We have not seen anything like that yet, but we have always open our eyes for this, ” she said.
“ We’ll disclose a lot of data, from week to week, month to month, to ensure that what we’re giving us is more consistent with our customers.
It was Cloes who rubbed the road for collection campaigns such as Little Shop in Australia, but the first in the middle of 2018 was the drive force behind the best quarterly sale of the large market from the beginning.
Woolworths followed with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped the large market to increase its sales, and now last, the environmentally delicious presentation of Discovery Garden customers offers free plants and flowers for planting.
However, the new collection campaign could have less impact this time, as UBS-notifiers predict an increase in sales in large markets in Australia for the largest part of the financial year 2021.
Ronson said that customers can expect more widespread collection campaigns in the future, and that campaigns such as Little Shop will probably be rare.
“ There is a lot of gathering campaigns around the world that we look at, and we are constantly seeking inspiration from other countries, ” she said.
“We need to do this to ensure that we are increasingly doing better with our customers.”
5 Circles around the country in summer
The photographer and material manufacturer John Ragnar Jonason, often known as Jon From Iceland, have been more and less on a screening around Iceland since the world’s death.
John completed a basic business study at the University of Reykjavik a few years ago, but he is now working on travelling and making a market material for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early with John, or April, when he traveled all over the western square and stayed in his car.
What is over a year, he has gone about five or six circles around the country.
In addition, he has traveled in countless day trips here and there.
What trip has taken place?
“ For someone like me who is always on the spot and has seen everything, it’s hard to mention a favorite place.
It's more the weather and the company that matters.
Recently, after the opening of the roads in June, there has been a great increase in the highland.
They are always on their ways because it is so much adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is a possible favorite trip in the year, but then we went 25 together on 5 large cars at the Riverside and then to the river water."
What's in front of you this summer?
“ It’s a lot of exciting for me next time, but I was graduating with DIVE and now taking up a cultivation trip here and there around Iceland.
Then I was adding a bracelet to my “dotasis” so I'm going to get more out of the sea than before.
I'm then going on a 10-day solo trip with everything I need my back, but it's evident later in the summer wherever I go.
Otherwise, I'm going to be a lot up to the hills next year, because it's not possible to see that area all year."
What is your favorite place in Iceland?
“ It’s always hard to choose one place, but the Jack’s Arrangement has been part of my life since I remember.
Every summer, my family and I lived at the roots of the Great Britain Meal, and since then I have always felt well in that area.
I think it's safe to say I've come there over 100 times."
With what place in Iceland do you recommend visiting people?
“I am going to bring one perle from each country, but it is: the Moelagluve in Southern, the Eastern Government, Aldeyjarfoss in the North, the Red Sand in the West, the Snowdrop Sea Coal in the West and the last but not the last...
What is indispensable in the journey?
“I don’t go to land unless I have the following in the car: Good vase light, hanging room, lopapeysa, hunting knife, acoustic cow, refrigerator, and gay bits... Those who know me know what I am talking about. ”
Searching for 24 calms who fear having drowned from a island in Malavia
KUALA LUMPUR, Malacia (AP) — Malasia’s authorities said that on Sunday, 25 refugees who are afraid to be drunk after a boat kicked away from Langkawi, a northern Malasia.
Zawawi Abdullah, a high official at the Malasian National Holy Guard, said that the first information was shown by the police that only one of the 25 sailors who had stuck off the boat had reached singing to the country.
The man who survived the police’s help sent on Saturday has been held while the matter is examined, according to Zawawi.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslims have fled Myanmar for military operations, and many of them live in overwhelming refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of the inhabitants of Malavia, who have been a tendency to take boats that promise refugees a better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and aircraft were used for the search.
He said that the land - sanctuary will also warn seafarers in the region and the authorities in the neighbouring country Thailand to help with the search.
He didn't give any more information about the boat.
The last month, in Malavia, 269 sailing refugees in guards found bodies on board a boat suspected of being used to smuggle off the coast of Langkawi, who said that he was deadly willing to go back to the sea.
Later, Malachi’s National Holy Guest said that the 269 individuals had been transported from a larger ship with tens of people who were thought to have died and their bodies had been thrown into the sea.
The Prime Minister Muhyddin Yassin said that Malasia could not accept any more refugees because of the economic impact of the crown virus age.
He said, however, that those already in the country would not be sent back to the sea.
In Malavia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants, as well as some 180,000 refugees and refugees — including 10,000 royals — are registered at the United Nations Refugee Agency.
Inhabitants of Aswan gather, watch and return a shipment of chocolate to Sudan after a motorhome
On Sunday, on the gates of the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver fell into a bump due to a hit.
The inhabitants grouped to help the driver where he was lying and rescue the warning that had been boiled.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, declared his position so that the driver was “passing through our village; we couldn’t just stand by.
We should help people in distress, no matter where it comes from."
He added that the villagers had arrived in a ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the farm of the car, which is estimated to be three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr said that the villagers have been on the ground from morning to evening and saved as much of the farm as they could.
“ The most important thing we felt was to save the driver’s life, protect the farm, and open the international road again, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the damaged driver with water and housing, said Bahr, and they added that they just wanted to make sure that he came to and from the village safely.
There were already brotalams at the assembly, and the coronary virus could make them worse.
“ The home age alone calls on our elected representatives about the leadership and visions we expect in times of difficulty, ” says a report by Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of the American University’s Communication, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organisational development and management.
“ But we also face other debt constraints that are about the inherited sin of our nation and the race unevenness that has struck our country from its establishment. ”
The study examines the familiar material in relation to the parliamentary compassionary situation: lack of real relationships between categories, a list of limited opportunities for communication, excessive aggregation of power in leadership positions, continual demands for funding, limitations on interoperability between classes, negative impacts on the daily activity of media, the fact that the most important elections for seniors are often prechosing and finally silence of minority groups.
It is also warned that the plenary will move more into the network because of the world’s epidemic, where such a system, which allows elections by means of local representatives without the need to travel to Washington, may still increase the problems that exist.
If the idea of a conference reaches its footsteps, it would be a serious relapse for attempts to increase the interaction between categories, as stated in the report.
The report says: “The House was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet, and we are sure to understand why.
“But despite the need, such things should not be interpreted as virtue. ”
The document says that the plenary needs “greater than less interaction between senators, face to face. ”
They need to study the territories of each other better, have polite conversations to find a common surface, and to build a relationship based on trust that can lead to greater understanding and solutions."
The call for courtesy was particularly addressed during the week, when Ted Yoho, senator of the Republika from Florida, attacked Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Democrata from New York, with the words and his companions of the Rebublika group, agreed to attack Liz Cheney, Senator of the Republikas in Wyoming with hostile words.
Ms. Val Demings talks about the presidential office, tells Trump to hear it for merits.
Congressive Val Demings (democrats, Florida) was not ashamed of discussing her interest in carrying out the office of presidents of the possible government of Joe Biden and expressing sincere appreciation for the office.
This honourable member of the group of blacks was interviewed with BlackPressUSA in a direct broadcast for #FIYAH! The live party and told her story, an actor and the commitment that has brought her to the place she is today, and started with the words “You know all my story. I grew up as a daughter of a worker and a housekeeper in Jacksonville, Florida.”
Demings was one of the four prosecutors of the Congress of Representatives in the Jurisdiction of Donald Trump in the Elderly Department of January.
No matter whether the Board of Elders inflicts Trump, it will be recorded in the history that he is the fourth President who is accused.
In a interview with the NPR of its office at Capitol Hill, this former defendant was held: “Was this worth it? this has been worth every day. ”
She added that, despite the disappointment of the decision, democracies would have been obliged to follow the matter, regardless of its outcome.
In the interview, Demings explained that she was a opposition to Trump’s prison sentence for Roger Stone, who was sentenced to lie before the Congress (increasing other crimes) as well as to his achievement of other criminals who were sentenced to a similar crime, when she said “the obsessiveness of reaching your friends, those who have lied and deceived to discourage your errors. ”
Deamings is the top of Joe Biden's list of possible prosecutors to the President of the Deputy, which also holds President Karen Bass (democrats, California), Stacey Abram's former Congressman of Georgia, Senators Kamalala Harris (democrats, California) and Tammy Duckworth (democrats, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottoms Citizen Atlanta, Susan Rice, former U.S. Ambassador and some others.
She noted, however, that only one person would decide who would offer for Joe Biden in the autumn.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she gave her hand to her mouth while she laughed and felt whispering to those who looked at the direct broadcast, and added “If you want to call... you can do it for me. ”
No doubt, regardless of the political views of each one, history books consider this period as a time when developments in American politics and attitudes became.
It didn't happen to Demings.
She recalled that the number of women present to the US Deputy President is the opportunity to break through the remainder of the “glass roof ” — especially for women of African origin.
“ It’s exactly those opportunities that I’m working so hard for me all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard their colors are wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they are of the wrong sex, ” she said.
The Congresswoman decided to ensure that the National Committee of Democratic Group and the Biden Chairhouse would advertise and work with Black Press of America to get as many as possible to choose as possible.
“ I will call Tom Perez (President of the Democratic Group) and I will put this on the top of my list, ” Dementing promised.
She agreed that this had to happen now rather than later in the electoral battle.
When she answered the ex - minister Hillary Clinton’s words that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he lost his elections, and another editorial article that says that the President is preparing to reach himself, survived Dementing: “It was as much as it was possible to achieve myself. ”
“ But who would ever do this other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to break laws and ignore the governance file in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he doesn't endure losing.
I can quite believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those who let it happen."

New York City's representative says it "final" all right to exclude a white fireman from honor
A representative who deals with the issue of diversity in the New York City announces that it is “final” all right to keep a white fireman away from honor, so that fenceberries can all be black, according to a new news.
The white fireman Daniel McWilliams has raised a matter of disagreement for race after he was removed from a group of flag carriers at a memorial in November 2017 in order to recall the deceased members of the Vulcan Society, a brothership of black firemans.
The main agent of the fireplace in the field of diversity and accessibility, the lawyer Cecilia Loving, further rejected the decision in the negotiation of the New York Human Rights Department according to the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of the three volunteers of the department that, in a historical form, see the American flag at Ground Zero at the day following the attacks on September 11th.
According to the dear McWilliams, the defense department of the fireplace chose him to be alone to the flagbers in honor at the Memorial.
Being a fan of this act was “a great honor and privilege ” for McWilliams, as stated in the CNN law.
However, when he arrived in the action, he was meant to take part in the honour of the then President of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, for what is claimed, she had asked for all flagbers to be black at the fair.
She then asked McWilliams – a 29-year-old employee of New York City — to help in another way."
Among other things it claims that she asked him to do is to follow unchanged civilians and set specially dressed firemans away from the mess.
McWilliams claimed in his lawsuit that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the honor, because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was so, he said.
Wilson, who has been working at New York City for 21 years and also participated in the rescue work on 11 September, will have replaced McWilliams for one of the Vulcan Society members.
McWilliams claims that he left the memorial “to protect himself from further shame, humiliation, and shame, ” when friends and collaborators heard what happened between them, according to New York Daily News.
When Loving, a black one, witnessed the court, the lawyer McWilliam, Keith Sullivan, asked her: “So that praying for all to be black in honor is not discrimination? ”
“ No, it is not, ” said Loving, according to New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it would be okay to ask for all of them to be black in honor, which she replied: “All. ”
Loving explained that it would be OK to replace a white person with a black person to “bear up our speciality and different origins to create proud, consensus, and support for each other. ”
McWilliams first declared discrimination on the basis of the race of the New York City announcement in January 2018.
He then raised a case against Wilson, New York City, New York City, and unnamed individuals in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliams presented his dear ones, Wilson’s supporters had revenge on him and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have put hands on McWilliams and said: “I have heard of you, they told me you would be doing this, and now you know who I am. ”
Sullivan wrote that it would have been “hazardous ” to exclude McWilliam from honor to the Messe and indicate that one thing was not valid at all at the fireplace.
“ If you’re a black person and you’re disgusting a white person at the workplace, you’re mostly reminded, ” Sullivan said.
According to the lawyer, Wilson received “one hour of advice” because of her treatment with McWilliam.
During the time, a white person receives a “hearted punishment, ” wrote Sullivan.
“The New York City’s relaxation has created a policy and process that is intended to please the members of the Vulcan Society, who act in a racist manner, apologize for their actions and helpfulness ... and this needs to stop," wrote Sullivan too.
Threating the Walking Traveler and Needing Money
One was arrested in the middle of the city after a robbery trial, where he threatened a walking roadfarer and tried to get money from that person.
The man was stored in a prison cell.
Then the police were notified of a man with a knife in the middle of the city.
The knife was made up, and the report was taken.
From 17 - 05 C.E. to 05 C.E., about eighteen cases came in on the board of the police in the headquarters, and this morning, six were stored in a prison cell.
Police stopped, among other things, the driver of a motor vehicle that pulled a wheelchair on Kjalarnesi, where the wheelchair was in a very bad condition.
The wheelchair was stopped and intended the owner to provide a transporter to transport it to the city.
Then the police stopped the production of drugs in the year.
Two were arrested because of the matter, and they were released at the end of the report.
There was also announcement of individuals who shot fires in the year.
They had been escaped from the scene when a policeman came to the site “and probably knew the shame, where there is still a considerable length of the year’s assembly. ”
Thousands of inhabitants of Khabarovsk still demand the decline of Putin
Thousands of city inhabitants joined the Russian city of Khabarovsk yesterday and protested the arrest of the province manager in the so-called county south of East Russia and the establishment of his heritage, which has never lived in the province.
The former province manager, Sergei Furgal, enjoyed great popularity and tens of thousands of citizens protested when he was arrested and arrested in Moscow before this month, accused of ordering murder to three businessmen 15 years ago.
In the recent week, Furgal was formally appointed as a province manager, and his 39 - year - old class brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, was appointed to replace him with a little impressive inhabitants.
Degtaryev has been said unexperienced and, worse, without any connection with Khabarovsk and called the city’s inhabitants after his statement the quickest.
These calls have made Degtaryev hurt as a wind of ears.
Yesterday the Protestants were smaller than in the first Protestants, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the requirements were the same as before: the liberation of Furgal and the statement of Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
“We want the District Manager to be released, because we believe that his arrest is very likely to be illegal,” has the AFP News Office after 30 contradictors, Alina Slapova.
She claims that the cremlars had arrested Furgal “to defend their own interests, not the interests of the province. ”
The police in Khabarovsk made protesters unreasonable despite the continuation of the demand for a cloudless violation of the valid ban on the meeting due to the age of the Chorona virus.
However, in Moscow, the police arrested at least ten people who gathered at Puschkin to show protesters in Khabarovsk support in work, says the British magazine Guardian news.
The group of Furgal, a freely democratic group of Russia, is a group of hardline nationalisms, and is considered somewhat loyal to the Crimean Government in most cases.
The same political explanators, however, informed BBC that Furgal’s victory in the District Director’s Choices two years ago — large and untwisted — had been a great shock for Pútin and the United Russian Republic, and although it suggested that Kremlar’s takeover in the eastern regions would weaken.
Furgal was arrested on July 9 and moved to Moscow, where he waits for a court.
He is accused of ordering three murders in 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were made, and the third went out of the ducks.
Sarah Rainsford, reporter BBC in Moscow, says that the followers of Furgal, who enjoy great popular homes, are convinced that the accusation and arrest have political roots.
They want to know why governments have waited to arrest him until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his violation.
The tree compartments came when Hanna runs over South Texas.

South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox tell about their experience of discrimination
In recent weeks, many osteoporosis have still been in the safe in connection with race law in sports in South Africa.
Constructive conversations need to take place and take action for everyone to be welcomed in sports.
Ashwell Prince, the former cricket star of Proteas, sent his former white companions to hear it and accused them of racial prejudices by saying that he and other black companions were “quoters. ”
Prince said the black players of Proteas have officially been called "vota players" by their white companions.
He added that it was sad that even though black players like Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada had the highest values of sport, some people still related to the quota talk.

"You're doing everything right, but you'll get infected anyway"
Paul Roberts, a former musician and designer who became a NASA developer, is now working with a software company.
He and his wife, a former nurse at the Methodist Hospital who viewed himself as a optimistic person, kept out of an online newspaper and attended Comic Con events earlier in years.
Once a week, they have two daughters, a son-in-law and a 7-year-old granddaughter and play awesome Uno games.
“ They are incredible northern lands, ” says Roman, 38 years old, about their parents.
Sheryl Roberts, a 65 - year - old, is aware of the risks of the world’s epidemic – she has diabetes, asthma, and cardiac disease that can increase its risk.
Her husband has a chronic lung disease and a constipation, which keeps a previously steady crane open.
“ We have gone so carefully, very carefully, and we have stayed away from people, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband began working out of the home of the spring, when the epidemic struggled hard in the Washington Kingdom, New York and other areas around the country.
Paul has occasionally entered a large market during “old times of men, ” and the only real date they had in the past month was, according to Sheryl, when they began to see wildflowers through the car window.
Their younger daughter was also careful.
But then she came home from work one day in the middle of June and thought that she was allergic.
Soon she had cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all taste and smell, which are typical symptoms of the crown virus.
“ She said, “I don’t know what’s going on, Mom, but I had a mask, washing my hands, ” she said.
"You do everything right, but you get infected anyway."
Elaine Roberts, who was diagnosed with a positive crown virus membrane, did not get seriously sick.
However, the situation was much worse in her parents.
Paul Roberts and his wife began to kiss and then cough, like their daughter, and then had a fever and a lot of work in their body.
He then became “toughly sick, thoroughly soon, ” said Sheryl Roberts.
On June 22, he became confused.
She worried about his oxygen level.
It was low, and she asked their older daughter to take him to an emergency meeting, for the second time in two days.
According to a new book, the Kingly Pair of the former felt that it was “heavened ” in the Queen’s Christmas talk
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Britaprins found his grandmother, the Queen of Great Britain, have “ignored ” them in their Christmas talk.
The new life story of the couple, “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they were found to be overlooked by those in the library that could be seen in the Christmas talk.
Pictures on the desk with which the queen sat showed, among other things, Wilhhelm of the British Prince, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Britaprins, and his wife Camilla as well as Prince Philip.
However, Meghan and Harry did not see any despite Archie’s birth in May, but the boy was mentioned as her “eight grandchildren. ”
The new book, published in August, also states that Meghan and Kate Middleton were “never friends, ” since they“ had a hard time to overcome superficial courtesy ” and met only a few times.
Thus, yesterday it was argued that his brother’s disagreement with Harry and Vilhelm had started some years before his relationship with Meghan, but that it had reached a climax because of Vilhelm’s marriage and Kate Middleton.
The Duke of Sussex felt that he was a “warning skier ” at events with his brother and Kate Middleton, and it is argued that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan came to history. ”

Commanders were accused of wishing that employees “were at home forever ” after protesting Boris Johnson’s call for people to return to work.
The Conservation Group’s senators were angry when the public and general employee’s business community told their companions to ask their feet when their bosses ordered them to return to their workplace.
Andrew Percy, former Minister, said “inappropriately ” that the necessary official service, such as the release of passports, would be stopped while employees on the general market would have worked hard to keep the community running in the crown virus age.
“ It is unacceptable for people to refuse to return to their jobs while workers in stores and factories throughout the country have continued to work so that officials can eat while this has been done, ” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to go to summer vacation, but they cannot do so because of the people who refuse to return to their jobs, even though they are safe.
Commanders cannot maintain this policy of living at home forever — especially now that we know that people can return to work safely."
After a presidency call last week, Alex Chisholm, a newly appointed director of the official service, announced that a deputy “was dismissed from the fact that employees in the official service of the worker’s home, and rushed their return to their workplace to August 1st. ”
The company of official and general employees expressed their companions, who counted about 200,000 people, that they would not have to comply with this requirement, and that was a matter of politics.
A spokesman of the public and general employees, the largest working company of British employees, said that the need to return to workplaces “was not provided with the health and safety of our societies in advance, or to strengthen the economy.
This is a loneliness resulting from political pressure from the Conservation Group’s Conservation Group, who demands that official service be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our recommendations to companions are clear: If you live at home and someone in your department asks you to come back to the workplace, do not take it as of course that you need to do it."
The issue is due to increasing dissatisfaction with delayed versions of passports because employees work at home, but about 400 000 people are now said to wait for their application processing.
The Ministry has now published that it will be “short” applications from the UK for travel in the next two weeks, and from those who have been waiting for a passport for more than four weeks.
Public and general employees’ professional society has acknowledged that some have had to wait for up to 143 days for passports, but claims that “small and often narrow offices ” make 4000 staff difficult to keep the necessary distance.
David Davis, former minister of the government, urged the leaders of a trade union to “have a wise worker ” and to seek leads in cooperation with governments to return people to their workplaces.
So he added that if he was in government, he would ask a chief director, “What do you want to be home all summer? ”
However, several largest companies in Britain have also ignored Johnson’s recommendation to people to return to work.
A study at larger jobs, with a total of about 40,000 employees, revealed that only about 40,000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
Emphasis on history can play an important part of the joy
The gay has been widespread, but understanding and satisfaction should be the goal.
The school system is part of the fault of this knowledge and understanding card.
Too little is taught from Australian history.
The fact is that without radical action, the only instruction that specifically deals with our history — “Saga Australia ” for 12 classes — will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
Last year, only 628 students in the Viktorium studied Australia’s history of a total of 49.324 graduate students, or only 1%.
In the last six years, this number has almost decreased by half, but nearly 100 fewer students have registered each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s history in the 12th class is that little has been done in the previous years of study to raise their interest.
History is not even a unique study area, but it is subject to the broader “consciousness. ”
Thus, students in the 7th and 8th class only completed one short unit on “the precipitation and eastern eagles of Torres and their culture”.
In the nineth and tenth year, there is another unit of Australia during World Wars.
For many students in Viktoria, this is all what is taught about Australia’s history in the primary school years.
In the nineth and ten years, another optional unit is between 1750 and 1918.
It is important to take three steps to save Australian history at Victory Schools.
First, history needs to become an independent study, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is only taught as part of science, it has little space in the study program.
It is usually taught by people who have general science education but have not been academic.
Historical skills such as the analysis of information are complex.
We need to advise more specialists to ensure that such skills are accessible and exciting.
Third, Australia’s history from 1788 to 1914 must become a compulsory article.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students chose not to learn Australia’s history in the 12th year of study, for they would have had to learn the material from the ground.
Knowledge of the story alone does not bridge deep gaps between races.
But without it, as we can see in the Viktorium’s study catalogue, the project is hopeless.
Dr. Matthew Bach is a Senator of the Victory and former assistant school director Ivanhoe Girls' Grammar.
Aron Elis in a Decisive Game of the European Union - Isaac divided by a lot into a half-play
Aron Elís Trándarson has been in a decisive game of European seats in the Danish electoral department in football.
Isaac Bergmann Johnson played only a first half of the game with Norrskaping’s top team against the bottom of Falkenberg in Sweden.
Aron Elis was a member of the OB in Denmark when the team continued to play a decisive role in the pre-competition of the European department.
OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, but it depends on whether the joints end up after the final circulation of the top part of the Danish section later today.
Aron Elis played the whole game at 1 to 1 equally with Horsens on the outfit today, while OB had worked the former game in homefield, 3 to 1, and thus worked a total of 4 to 2.
Isaac was at the beginning of the Norrskaping team, which was unexpected 2 to 0 below the first half of the game against the bottom of Falkenberg in the Swedish selection department.
In the beginning of the second half - game, the Norscrew made a threefold division and was one of the ones who had to depart.
Norrcreation was estimated to be the same as Falkenberg arrived at 3 to 2 on the 89th minute.
But there was still time for Norscream to equip hell in the last hour, 3–3.
The North Creation remains at the top, at 24 points, four points before the city of Elf, and five points before Malmö, who plays good later today.
The step was enough to get out of the bottom for a while, but the team is a ladder above the city of Helsing and Kalmar, who has a good game.
Collected Records of Nations Festival in Crown Virus Periods
Anna Lilia Victory daughter set up the Facebook group “My National Festival 2020” to gather records of the national festival that is intended for the next weekend.
Many are going to tent in their gardens and enjoy with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilja talked to Hurta in the Holy of the Wave.
“ Nothing has yet come in, which is very exciting, too, because there are 600 people in the group so that they are clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lilja.
Something is about the Eyes to be with tent festivals at home in a garden.
“ People have talked about being with their own [feast], perhaps tending in the garden, and putting together the family as they always do at that time, ” says Anna.
“ You expect that you will spend the time with your people.
However, she is likely to say that many are simply not going to be “but still to hold some small national festival somewhere else. ”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard to reimburse the books purchased, but Anna thinks that many homemen are rather trying to make a record at the next year’s festival.
“Man is even investing now in the banknotes and making it valid by 2021.”
“ I am a great National Festival, I love the preparation, and all around this, but sometimes something comes into the life that you do not rule, and then it is just that way, ” says Anna, but it has somewhat been said that people are asking whether the Eyes cannot release the National Festival “one time. ”
Anna Lilja claims not to have set up the group for himself or to encourage people to hold their own National Festival, but to gather records of Sales Holy Festivals in the Eyes this year.
“ What did people do in these strange times?
I'm not going to use this in something or anything, but then I'm going to see somebody who uses such permissions in something but I was just creating some area where people can insert what it's doing."
In addition, it has been loaded up an annual burning of a Piglot.
“ I think many are excited to get burned on Friday evening.
Of course, the only thing that makes a strike in the account is that the prophecy is no specific."
“ It will be ignited in this burning, but it just has to show how it will be, ” says Anna Lilja.

Will Prince Andrés be mentioned in a new document of sexual crime?
The British King’s family now prepares to respond to possible new information in judicial documents about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A U.S. Judge has ordered that secret documents about Epstein and Maxwell be made officially
Among the things found in these 80 pages of documents are items with witnesses Maxwell from the year 2016
The display of these pages could also put great pressure on Prince Andrés where they find interconnection between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
In 2015, Virginia Roberts, meant a sexual slave of the narrowly American financialist, claimed in judicial documents that she had been forced to have contact with Prince Andrés.
Prins Andrés is now preparing to defend the possible publication of information during the week with the even more harmful accusations of his friendship with the child pet Jeffrey Epstein and his deceived wiseman, Ghislaine Maxwell.
The U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska appointed the week for the publication of 80 secret legal documents related to Maxwell and Epstein, which count hundreds of pages.
The display of these huge vast documents would be a shock for the 58 - year - old Maxwell, where they have a large portion of its witnesses before the lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “reasonable questions ” about her sexual history.
They could also put great pressure on Prince Andrés, where one of the documents contains communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts meant a sexual slave of the narrowed American financialist, claimed in 2015 in judicial documents that she had been forced three times to have a relationship with Andreas.
Andrés has repeatedly rejected these claims.
An e -mail from 2015 that has been leaked and BBC published last year seems to indicate that Andrés asked Maxwell to respond to Robert’s claims.
We're in no doubt that the Duke will get a rebellion
There he said to the superior woman: “Let me know when we can talk, with certain questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied: “It has information, call me when you have a free time. ”
Yesterday’s evening, an author who stands near Andrew said: “The Duke of Jordan has done nothing wrong, so we are not concerned about opening up the court.
As courts in the United States have strived to point out, it does not mean that, even though it appears in judicial documents, an accusation is true.
American courts have encouraged the media and public to take care of the most careful treatment of the charges raised in judicial documents.
We totally agree.
We have no doubt that the Duke will get a full rebellion in the next few weeks."
Maxwell is now in the guard centre of Manhattan, waiting for some of Epstein’s victims who were under law from 1994 to 1997.
It is also accused of harm for refusal to report on his abuse.
She rejects all the accusations.
Maxwell last talked to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s injury head, who is now under the aftername of Giuffre, which she took up after marriage.
About 40 pages of a total of 418 were made officials last year, but after the decision of Judge Presna in New York last week, more items could be opened first on Thursday.
An attorney Maxwell was given one week to submit a request.
Epstein was found dead in his New York prison cell last year when he was waiting for sexual offences.
Inspectors are looking for a criminal attack on Edinburgh's streets
Three attacked a man in Edinburgh and caused him pain that could prove lasting.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked at Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 23:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The Scottish police reported that he had been transferred to the Royal Hospital with serious pain.
The investigator Dale Miles, director of the study, said: “This was a violent and unreasonable attack. ”
The suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One of them was considered to be in the 40 ’ s, about 180 inches in height and strongly growing.
He was cut short and dark hair in a white ball, dark pants and dark shoes.
Miles, a researcher, said: “I prayed all those in this area when the attack was made and saw something suspicious about giving up. ”
The missionary wants a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. Ambassador of Iceland, wants to carry a gun in this country and wants to increase security.
He has been said to be “sick ” about his security since he arrived in a country last year.
This is noted in the CBS news, which also says that this will be Gunter, despite the fact that he is working in “one of the safest kingdoms in the world. ”
It is said that Gunter has asked the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs to leave it to the Icelandic government that he may carry a gun.
Then he has asked for a car and a west guard that protects him from knifes.
CBS, however, has repeatedly announced Gunter that he is not in danger in Iceland.
The CBS report notes that the Icelandic Ministry did not disclose whether a request had been made from the United States for the possible weapons operation of Gunter, because the authorities did not express the security measures of foreigners.
Although no request has been made, the news agency’s authors say.
Then, after his authors have been told that Gunter was not to seek weapons, CBS also would be taken as an insult in the country.
Gunter is unexperienced as an erythematic, but has been a skin disease physician in California for years.
He is active in the U.S. republic group and prone supporter Donald Trump, President of the United States.
He recently raised attention to this land when he read about the “invisible Chinese virus. ”
CBS also reports that Gunter has been depressed significantly to the occupational spirit of the U.S. Ambassador in Reykjavik.
He already had seven next-committee staff in the May missionary board.
He has, among other things, accused them of belonging to “the Deep Kingdom, ” which is to be the network of American officials who work against Trump, and reacted angry with the fact that one bar sneeze into his office.
According to CBS, the transmitter traveled to Washington DC in February before a conference and refused to return to Iceland for a few months.
Gunter was said to have wanted to work from California, but after all, Mike Pompeo, U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs, had to order him to return and do so in May.
The home game form is a key element for Jose Mourinho, who says Tottenham has easier games to play when the followers can come back to a game
With Jose Mourinho’s help, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game at home since the electoral department began again, but he says that if the audiences were released to play, it would be much easier to maintain a good way at home.
In this season, Spurs has won 12 victories at home, but lost four times — only one of the six joints above has lost more in the home.
The Portuguese coach said that if such victories were possible without the followers, it would be easier to maintain it if they were there.
“We have to do this with the fans, and without them, we can build up some kind of work, where the play plan is in the front,” he said.
“ But I think that much more powerful is to do it with the fans, because then the emotional side of the game is added, which is only with the help of fans at home. ”
Mourinho believes that with stronger competitors, it will be more and more difficult to maintain the long victory periods that he knows from Chelsea, or Liverpool has built up in the past three seasons.
However, this is also a key element in determining whether the end of the period will reach its goals, especially in matching games and neighborhood laws, where the atmosphere in the field can divide creatures.
“I believe that the policy of the electoral department is that it becomes more and more difficult to hit this unfair value, because of what has been good.”
“ However, it is important to be strong at home, and at the end of the season, they have collected a number of stages with victories in home games. ”
“ I am pleased with the finals of home games in the past, without the fans, but we need to get them back.
I see a victory against Arsenal with the pit full of Tottenham adversaries.
This is a feeling that is built up slightly and slightly."
Buyers excited for desired lifestyles in Lovely Banks
“ Greater is better, ” is evidently the motto of new large property owners in the district of Lovely Bank, which was recently sold at 1270 Australian dollars.
Interested purchasers looking for lifestyle property near the centre of Geelong were flying to review these 1,35 hectares of land property, where there can be a car desk for 14 cars, swimming pools and views over Corio Floa.
Joe Grgic, property salesman in Harcourts, North Geelong, said that an offer in the land property that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days of its marketing.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove back to sale
Home option for isolation
“ We received a number of offers from various parties, ” said Grgic.
“The property was sold to a homeman who is very excited.”
The property is accompanied by four rooms of houses on two hills, including special bathrooms that are large enough to sleep.
The new owners have a choice of three rooms and can use a refurbished kitchen and updating outdoor area with a view over the pool.
“ This was how the property was composed, that it was three lands, and that it was in this place, ” said Grgic.
“ Here came interested buyers from Melbourne, who wondered what the property was of the centre but still with a countryside.
“I have people who lost and buyers who are still looking for. ”
He said that the large storage area, which includes a double truck and a free-standing shelf of 10-12 drives, was perfect for professionals or to store a wheelchair and a trailer.
Counting their security threatened in Iceland
“Despite being appointed as the safest country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been prone to his security since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
This is how a detailed discussion of CBS News about the American Ambassadors in Iceland begins, which represents a number of CBSs from the United States Foreign Services.
The CBS report claims that Gunter requested the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he would be granted a special authorisation for the arms of the Icelandic governments.
Then he should also have wanted for a bridge - guard car, as well as for ideas about a west that could protect him from crushing attacks.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to officially declare that Gunter’s safety is really threatened in Iceland, but, according to officials’ information, Gunter has been repeatedly stated that he is not in any special danger.
Despite the advertising of the United States ambassadors in Iceland recently after full - time lifeguards, including in the morning magazine of July 18th, CBS claims that it is done to disturb Gunter’s concerns.
The United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs does not express itself on the precautionary security operations associated with their missionary boards, but it always states that security is preventive.
The Ministry does not answer questions concerning Gunter's request for arms living, and the Icelandic Ministry does not want to say whether the United States formally requested that the ambassador be able to carry weapons, and usually does not say that he is not speaking about the security of foreign ambassadors.
However, according to their Icelandic authors, CBS has never been submitted for such a request, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was taken from these plans, where they could become offended to residents in Iceland.
The CBS also discusses the various problems that have been envisaged by the U.S. Ambassador of Iceland since Gunter was appointed a missionary last year, but he will already have divided out seven times.
Thus, the first warranty soldier is said to have prepared himself for a long time and learned Icelandic only to have been denied the position in the last minute because Gunter “does not read on him” at their first meeting.
His followers have not been much better under Gunter’s control.
Governments of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs are said to be conscious of the position in the Icelandic ambassador, but they are reluctant to intervene in matters related to the President’s close links.
Besides all of this, Gunter is deceived to follow the various rules of the foreign service and respect the order of power.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to take part in a Washington conference and was said to have refused to return to Iceland afterwards, leaving his temporary place of work for months, and in the middle of the world’s age.
Will Gunter even wanted to do his work remotely and said that he would not return to Iceland unless the foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, asked for it in particular.
According to information provided by the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take a personal permit after the conference and the Crown Virus Age further disappeared his journey, but according to the CBS, many within the Ministry will have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he did not until May, following Pompeo’s contact with him and please asked him to return to the embassy in Iceland.
The CBS also reports the adversities of Gunter in Iceland, especially in connection with the timing of the crown virus “the invisible Chinese virus ” and has received great criticism.
Gunter is one of many, almost unexperienced in the field of foreign missionary service appointed by President Donald Trump.
The case Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; the Bharatiya Janata group says a government crisis in the state; the Congress Party wants voting
Ashok Gehlot said that if this was needed, the Congress Group would have to take a seat objection outside the home of a presidency minister.
On Saturday, the day after a peaceful protest to Raj Bhawan, Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister Rajasthan, said that if this was needed, the Congress Group’s Senators would have to meet the president and make a seat objection outside the presidency’s home to bring the cry in the kingdom to smell.
At the assembly of the Congress Group, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to hold voting in order to check whether the majority of the congress members and conspiracy were with him in the battle of power.
“ He said that the government has a majority and wants to go to voting, ” says Mahesh Joshi, the headquarters of the Congress Group, after the meeting.
The conference was held in a hotel, where the ministers who support Gehlot have held themselves in the last days.
“ The Prime Minister asked us to be ready to stay longer in the hotel.
He said that if he had to do so, he would meet the president and also keep peaceful objections outside the home of a presidency minister," said a class leader.
The Prime Minister Rajasthan can call the assembly together and let the Congress Party show its majority, said the class leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday, indicating that the Bharatiya Janata group's board of Ashok Gehlot's government had arrived.
“The country is now governed by the laws and regulations.
Governments are formed and served by the people’s authority.
Bharatiya Janata has discovered that the government of Rajasthan has been dismissed.
This is an offense of 80 million inhabitants of Rajasthan.
The Prime Minister must call the assembly together to make the truth come before the land,” Gandhi said in the tithe of Hindi.
Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister Rajasthan, told the Congress Group’s congress members on Saturday that he was prepared to go to the Indian President’s meeting to ensure that what he called “Bharatiya Janata ” to stop a statement of confidence with a voting contribution does not succeed.
On Friday, Gehlot, who protested for many hours at the home of the Kingdom director Kalraj Mishra, met with the Congress Group’s congress members and the government on Saturday, and after the meeting new proposals were built and approved by government.
Mishra asked Gehlot last night to return the assembly request and referred to six objections.
The approval will soon be sent to the governor.
Gehlot has accused the Chairman of suspending the assembly, where he is “under pressure” to stop the voting payment that cuts its confidence in his government.
When Gehlot met his government, Bharatiya Janata, the Head of the Chairman of Satish Poonia, and the leader of the Governing Opposition of Gulab Chandra Kataria, with the Head of State to discuss the position of COVID-19 in the State.

Spencer Grammer's game woman surrounded outside of Manhattan's restaurant
NEW YORK – The playwoman Spencer Grammar said he's been trying to calm a angry man when he cut her on her arm and put her friend in her back outside the restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, a 36 - year - old, told the US Weekly that she and her friend would have done what all others would have done in the same situation as they had been trying to prevent the situation from worsening when they were attacked.
Grammer and her 32-year-old friend were sitting at the surface of The Black Ant in the East Village district of Manhattan at 23:30 a.m.
on Friday, when a man went up to them, and demanded a reward, and then the restaurant was closed.
Grammer and her friend were hurt when they tried to “resolve a conflict between an unknown man and other local guests, ” according to the police.
The man ran out of the place after he wounded the right arm of Grammer and put her friend into the mugg with an unknown odd - wheat thing, said a policeman.
No one has been arrested.
Grammer, who speaks for Summer in the "Rick and Morty" factors and previously played in the "Greek" series of ABC Family, is the daughter of the "Frasier" star Kelsey Grammer and the actress Doreen Alderman.
Grammer said that both her and her friend expected to get quickly.
None of them suffered serious internal pain, she said.
In a declaration to the US Weekly, Grammer thanked those who responded in the field and the staff of the Bellevue Hospital who listened to them and referred to the “incredible struggle” of these staff at the Crown Virus Age.
“ It touched us very much to have the opportunity to thank them in our own personality, ” said Grammer.
“I don't want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic evening on UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The Khamzat Chimaev fighter from Russia is now called the next star of UFC after he has recorded himself in the history of Fight Island, but he does not say that he is not going to strike his wealth in an absurd way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev carried the North Iran of Rhys McKee in their battles in the sturdy of Abu Dabi on Saturday evening when he conquered his competitor when three minutes and 9 seconds had passed by the first round by having hit him in the floor.
The victory recorded the name of Chimaev in UFC history books for the shortest time between the victory in the modern history of the race, where only 10 days had passed since he conquered the British John Phillips in a similar decisive way, in an intermediate way.
Chimaev, with the victory rate of 8-0, received 500,000 US-Dala Bonus for the performance of the evening against McKee and has so fully attended the MMA world that he is now called “Khalib 2.0”, which may be said to be an inevitable comparison because of the great likelihood between the superior Chimaev and the UFC master in lightweight and where he is born in Téténia, which is near the homes of Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite newly found famous and financial benefits, the popular Chimaev has said that he would not like to flag his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his companion in the box world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I do this not just for myself, but for everyone I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," said Chimaev when he was asked about how he would use the bonus on Fight Island.
He has, among other things, raised attention to Conor McGregor's companions and the work of the Twitter user Dillon Danis, who wrote on the social record that he could “slightly” conquer Chimaev with a donor.
There was no poisonous answer from the battle cabinet, which is called “Borz, ” or“ wolf ” in his native language, Czech, who said that he would “male Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who is now living in Stockholm, Sweden, after being moved to the country 19 years old, may have little to do with his financial power, but he is obviously insufficient to relieve his ability to fight.
“ I can paint anyone...
How many fighters are in the Sulting Department?

The Israelites continue to object to the reactions of the presidency of the World Castle
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested against presidency ministers in many parts of the country on Saturday and were the greatest objections outside the official seat of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have been over for a few weeks, but they began because of the critics who consider the government’s negligence to respond to the crown virus age after the threat of the virus has been established at the beginning.
Netanyahu’s complaints for corruption have even more undermined the protests.
“ Bibi, go home, ” said one of the Protestants.
On the second panel, “All see that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Hundreds of Protestants also gathered outside the beach house of Netanyahu in the well - being city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to disperse groups in Jerusalem.
After what has been called rapidly and unorganized reopening of economic life in May, the average number of new cases per day rose up to 2000.
The country's economy has been struck due to the limits of virus and unemployment has grown largely to nearly 20%.
Protestants say that the government’s financial assistance was not enough.
The protests took place in the shadow of judicial charges against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
Interrogations start in January.
He is accused of betrayal, confidentiality, and mutilation in a series of harmful matters.
Hundreds of Protestants gather in the center of Los Angeles to show consensus with Protestants in Portland
LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) — About 300 Protestants gathered in the centre of Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon to support two months old movements in Portland, Oregon, which focuses on federal police after conflicts with Protestants.
Similar contradictory meetings took place across the United States, including in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.
The protests in Los Angeles were organized by the Refuse Fascism and Youth Liberation Front.
The team went to the headquarters of the police in Los Angeles at First Street and Main Street and then to the Main Centre of the Great City.
The participants also moved to the Alameda-free at the 101 road, but later left it.
In the midst of the city, the people saw breaking windows in federal buildings, and they were written on national marks.
At least one person was arrested in the protests.
50 people in Moscows at the Eid Festival and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, says the government of Karnataka
The Festival of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, will take place on July 31 and August 1st.
The Karnataka authorities have published that only 50 may meet in mosques for prayer for Eid-ul-Azha, and have banned prayer meetings at Eidgah and other places for the crown virus age.
Guests who want to be asked for in mosques must have masks and keep away, according to the order from AB Ibrahim, the Ministerial Director of Minorities and Wakf.
The order states that the Hilal Committee decided that the Festival of Eid-ul-Azha, also called or Bakrid, should be held on 31 July in the provinces of Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kodaga, but on 1 August elsewhere in the country.
The order states that even though prayer meetings are one of the most important saints of Muslims at the Bakrid Festival, such events in Eidgah and other places will be banned because of the COVID-19 epidemic.
However, prayers will be allowed in mosques to have no more than 50 share in one.
If it would be more than that for the time of prayer, then the Minister of Ministers stated in the directive.
No prayer meetings may be held elsewhere, such as meeting houses, social centres, or “Shadi Mahal. ”
The Karnataka governments will house the temple, moscow and other prayers will open to those who want to pray for from June 8th to give care to the contraceptives of COVID-19.
The U.S. Ambassador wants a armed lifeguard.
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, U.S. Ambassador of Iceland, thinks his life is threatened by the country and wants to go with weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. ambassador repeatedly advertised “bodyguard ” in the Icelandic newspapers and actually used the English word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to Kälks, the main reason why these jobs were advertised is that Jeffrey Ross Gunter believes that his life is threatened in Iceland.
Icelandic and foreign authors have been discussed by the ambassador who is convinced that he is in great danger and why he is of Jewish families.
What the danger is, is not as clear, but Kbrand’s advertisers said that Islamic terrorists had been named as threats.
The CBS television station discussed the issue on its web this morning and, according to Washington’s authors, Gunter has been persecuted, demands to carry his own weapons, to get an injector - hot west, and to follow arms alongside shot-held automobiles.
According to CBS, Gunter has repeatedly been told that there is no threat and that the "bodyguard" advertisement is only to dispose of Gunter.
According to Kälks, the positions at the end of June had not been recruited, but the application period ran out in February.
According to Kölks, no formal report from the United States Commission has been delivered because of these changes.
Neither has been formally requested for increased care, nor for authorization for a guard to walk outside the ambassador’s walls.
The Icelandic law is decisive that this is not permitted except with a special authority from the Government Police Officer.
No information is available on any danger.
The most recent dangers of the State Police Officer are somewhat decisive about terrorism.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence that terrorist or extreme groups are working here.
According to K Brenns, there are no preliminary requirements for the arms of foreign guards on the streets of cities and cities in Iceland.
Gunter raised a great deal of attention here in the country when he dealt with the United States President's fashion and called the COVID-19 "Chinese Virus".
He had the American and Icelandic flag.
A radio in Seattle, who cunning Trump's reaction to protests, says now he has to get a gun after the Starbucks-café under his apartment was put in ruin – RT USA News
Paul Gallant has received a new view of violent protests after he had risen to President Donald Trump in June for saying that Anarchists were burning and robbing the city of Seattle.
The only thing that needed was that the spirit was closer to the governor’s home.
“I feel like I have to buy a firearm because this will obviously continue to happen,” said Gallant on Twitter on Saturday evening after he saw that entertainers had “broken” the Starbucks-café at the bottom of his village house.
"Now it's enough, this looks like a street party down on the street from me. Very angry now."
The reactions were quite different when Trump last month complained that the city’s director of Seattle would allow violent Protestants to take over the city.
“These free Democrats are glorious,” said the President.
“Terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they just feel wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, a co-inspector of the Danny & Gallant at the ESPN Cooperative Radio Station in Seattle, answered by a tie: “Get through there for curiosity last night, neither burning nor robbery nor death.
Gallant said last night that the police had advised the people to stay away from his apartment building where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks café.
He published pictures of the damage and said: “Good done, idiot, ” and noted that he had also seen fire a few long houses away.
“Don’t have a idea of what's going on, but the cat and I are going to find out.”
The reversal did not pass by people who sued to Gallant before his first view and latest messages, such as “Sleep on a lax, ” and“ Jah, perhaps Trump was right. ”
Jason Rantz, another radioman in Seattle, said: “If we wouldn’t finally go to this viewing trip we discussed. ”
Gallant went to the joke: “Awake, seeing that a lot of people were “slapping of lax ” to me. I laughed. ”
He said he was standing with his previous claim, as he had walked through the CHAZ self-control area of anarchists and although it wasn't as bad as it had been designed.
“ So they were burned and robbed after all, ” he said, “Justified. ”

Counts too early to claim about other waves here in the country
A pediatric expert at the pharmaceutical department says too early about the other waves of the epidemic.
Three new inland infections were diagnosed in the National Hospital’s Virus Department yesterday, and tens of thousands of people have been in suicide.
Two domestic medications were identified on Thursday, one in a man of thirty - year - old than the other in a man of twenty - year - old.
Then no infection had been detected since the beginning of the month.
Yesterday, there were three additional inland medications, one of which had been at Rey Cup’s football convention in Laugardal.
John K. Johannsson, the information agent of the State Police Officer, conversed with a newsroom, says that less had to be showed because of this infection than originally was considered.
The second is a person who came to the country from abroad on 15 July.
At that time, rules on the so - called home port had been adopted.
Camilla Ruth Sigfus ’ daughter, a pediatric expert at the National Medicines Office, says that, however, the patient went through the old process.
His vision was negative at arrival to the land, and then he became sick, in isolation, and six have been put into a petition.
They are all on their way to show, but two of them are starting to show symptoms.
The third infection is then related to the older man who was diagnosed on Thursday and has been put in the context of the disease.
There has been a new variation of the crown virus that has not been identified in the country before.
“ We don’t know exactly where this virus is coming from, but we have not seen it before.
He that was counted to carry the virus to the land had been in Israel, but also in other European countries.
She thinks it is too early to claim that the so - called other waves of the epidemic have taken place in this country, just as other European countries fear.
“ While the majority is still driveable, it is not boring.
But we're on our toes and are watching, thinking about ways to fail if something like that could happen."

I am interested in star signs, and I immediately knew that my twin soul was about," says Fox, 34 years old.
“ A twin soul is when the soul has come to a sufficient level of existence to divide into two different bodies at the same time, ” explained Fox.
“ So we are two helmets of the same soul, I think.
I told him that as soon as we met.
I found it right away."
“ When we had known for two days, I asked him to meet me for lunch, and I taught him about the star signs and asked him out in his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately."

Increased Weight in Protestants against Racial Rights in the United States
Protestants have walked through the streets of many cities in the United States to raise attention to race law.
A protest has passed for two months in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd died by a policeman at Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent federal police to Portland, and thereby still undergoing the protests.
Protestants now also contradict the nature of the federal police in the city.
In Seattle on Saturday, the police used bombs and tear gas and arrested 45 people, after a protest meeting for the support of the protests in Portland was released into violence.
According to the police, over 20 police servants were injured.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun was released into Black Lives Matter's demand.
Media records say that the man may have gone up to a gun - armed rifle before he was shot.
“ The core of the matter is that it is horrible for someone to be killed in protest, ” said Steve Adler, mayor Austin, in a statement.
Adler claimed to be “shared and wordless. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in the case of Breonnu Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when the police broke into her home, with a permission to enter without banking, and shot her.
The boyfriend Taylor had first shot to the policemen, for he thought they were a burglar.
One policeman has been fired because of Taylor's death, but the other police have not been charged.
The leadership of the NFAC group, a armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more transparency in the research police on the murder of Taylor.
According to police information, three members of the NFAC were injured on Saturday when the rebellion army shot accidentally.
Possible group infection in sealing
Five have been detected with Covid-19 infection this week outside the border.
Two of them were infected by the previously unseen variability of the virus, and the origin of three of the five infections seems to be completely unclear.
It is uncertain whether the individuals have been infected by a tourist who has returned from the country or the symptomatic islander, who is likely to have infected much more.
The local physician states that a possible group infection may be in the context of one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 on the land last Thursday, with the type of the virus.
The origin of the infections is still unclear.
Three were then diagnosed by the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by one of those who were diagnosed on Thursday, another came to the country last July 15 and was likely to have been infected outside, but the third also has an inflammatory source.
Following a series of Icelandic genetic analysis, the two subjects diagnosed with the virus and associated with its new variants that have not previously been identified in the country.
Camilla Joseph’s daughter, a physician, and a local physician, says that Icelandic genetic analysis is now undergoing the most likely presence of this type of virus.
“ The other case was similar to the virus that has been ongoing in Switzerland, but not exactly the same.
They are going to examine this and try to identify it better and lead the like that from what part of the world the infection comes from," she says.
"It seems to be here on the side of the Atlantic."
Thus, the infections are unrelated to the two who came up at the beginning of July and were dispatched to the United States.
Do you think that this new species has come outside rather than has been mutating here in the country?
“Yes, this is different from what has been found here in the past that there is really no probability that this has been something to paint here,” Kamilla answers.
“It is likely that these individuals have in some way come clear to a person who has recently arrived somewhere outside, without knowing it itself.”
The question is that there is still no evidence of where this new virus could have come to the country.
“ It may naturally be a traveler who has returned from the country, but there may also be someone who does not get any symptoms and does not realize that he has been infected, and that could naturally result in more infections.
We'll be on our toes the next days to watch it."
“ Anyone else has not come with a smart group infection.
But there are individuals who went into a pathway in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have been showing," continues Kamilla.
“ We have not yet made the conclusions of them.
So it could be a group infection in sealing."
Do you expect that there is a social injury now?
“ It is not excluded.
It has not been late, but it is not excluded because we don't know who's been carrying this infection in these individuals, which were disclosed on Tuesday and yesterday." she answers.
Could it be possible to mention that here is a new wave of the virus?
“ No, not yet.
Of course, however, we need to be very careful, and we need to bear this in mind, even though there are such limits for what we can take a lot of shows in people.
We do not take a show in people without symptoms, but first we are getting infected that seems to be inconvenient, we need to be given a little more free hands by taking a sample from people with symptoms,” she says.
Thus, in the next few days, the National Hospital Department of Antibiotic and Virology is expected to give the next day to try to better map the position in this country.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase the inland display and take care of skiing at the border?
“ Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there is a need to be a basis for taking an vision in individuals who are not in the skiing tasks; the person must be in a pathology and show symptoms or then have had symptoms and suspects of getting clear to someone who has recently arrived in the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
It notes that the infections that were diagnosed yesterday are still undergoing and that it is now working hard to get information about individual travels.
It says that the origin of domestic diseases seems to be inconsistent, but it does not exclude that some of those who have been infected can produce evidence that eventually leads the infectious team to the original infections.

The police claimed to have arrested 45 people, but 21 policemen would have been injured.
The protest was held in support of the protests to the neighbouring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the scene, after Trump ordered a very radical operation of the federal police, in unthankful local authorities, who say the police use excessive power.
Contradictions have been held in Austin, Texas, as well as Louisville in Kentucky, New York, Omaha, and Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, capital of Texas, one was shot to death in armed conflicts in central town on Saturday evening, according to the police.
The concurrent protests of Trump are increasingly challenging the struggle of re-choosing in November, and have developed a tough law policy.
