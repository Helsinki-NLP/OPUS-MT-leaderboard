28-year-old cook in San Francisco Mall found dead
A 28-year-old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre.
The brother of the victim said that he could imagine no one who would want to hurt him, "Endly it went up with him again."
The body found on Wednesday morning in Westfield Mall was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the direct medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations are running.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told the ABS Sender KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had worked as a cooker in Boston, had retired his dream job six months ago as a cook at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco.
A speaker of the Son's & Daughter said that they were "socked and destroyed on the ground" about his death.
"We're a small team that works like a narrow family and we'll miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia suggested that Frank lived in hostels at first, but that, "the things finally went up for him."
"He found a apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia KGO informed.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a kind man with a great heart.
To connect with his family, it was always something to cook us to prepare us for dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who swimed with the electricity.
"In everything that was wrong in the world, he was this unslipping diamond, which lighted every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's reference phone under point 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in boxes
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
This has made the Hollywood Star clear in an interview now indispensable.
"I'll always be put in boxes or get dressed up from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and the reality."
"I myself don't want to be perfect and successful."
"Surely, these things are more bitch to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, forming television with loose dutt and mexican food, says the magazine.
To the White Glut they bring the question of the child's desire: "We women don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a child game" Aniston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are overlookable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a little variation with a trip on the beach.
For the 58-year-olds, it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Goldene Sports Pyramide" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their celebration evening, they hunted home in the fast galoppy to the feed trawls.
One kilometre at this speed, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday Germany's best golfers of all times - 101 tournaments - were back near horses.
He was able to lead himself with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even force himself for photo purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid overdrove the man from Anhausen in the framework of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramide.
The sympathetic athlete isn't lacking in awards.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British queen has already embarked him.
Longer is the 18th prizemaker of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prizemaker Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is forgiven not only for sports successes but also for social commitments".
For decades Langer has promoted growth.
And so he also continued the price money of 25,000 euros at the same time.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-fold US master winner was taken into the "Hall of Fame of German sports" on Saturday.
Amazing are the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fighter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruler Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the Spring Rider Alwin Schockemöhle and Posthum of the Handballers Erhard wonderfully.
Many of these sports tenants came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrated society moved to the Spring Stadium where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer stayed apart from the big animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic policy compared: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that is what Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are unanimous in tax and energy policy as well as in a principle issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one, about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them small in doubt and warns about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, says Trump.
He will massively reduce regulations and make itself strong for a widespread tax reform with lower tax rates - for private and businesses.
On the other hand, Clinton says that the State has certain tasks to fulfil, he has the opportunity to open the disadvantaged and needs money for it.
Therefore, the taxes for the rich would be increased, says she.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say that they need to be invested at the same time.
The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the Republican State Critical Tea Party Flow.
Thus, Trump could still have a party-internal discussion.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and re-establish the coal promotion in the United States.
Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris Climate Protection Agreement he wants to announce.
Clinton, on the other hand, wishes to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment programme and asks: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It'll probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be us."
But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.
TPP, the Transpazific Trade Agreement, does not both want to sign.
At the same time, however, the United States does not want to isolate from international trade - but just better protect US jobs.
They will also be paid better, about Clinton demands.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.
She wants to increase to $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must rise, then he says he should not be changed.
However, the major discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more about the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to discharge the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics hold him so that the budget deficit would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants the rich to pay more taxes, and their critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Refuge: "Every woman who has escaped has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost to everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby, which is not more than one year old.
One put her little son in the arm.
He looks curious in the room with great eyes.
His mother stares on the table plate.
Until she notices that she's watched.
She is smiling and kissing the little one.
The scene works normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is a district manager of Condrobs, a social assistance provider in Bayern, and interacts among other things with the issue of women on the flight.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the Minchner North in one of the few decentralised accommodations for singlely escaped women and their children in Bayern.
In January, Condrobs opened the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Women's Help.
She was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There's no man - neither as a visitor.
The exception is a guard in front of the door.
"It is not excessive to say: Every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatening to torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopemakers," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape are overwhelming: "Many people are secretly stolen from it because they do not see any other way out."
In their homes, they have experienced sexual violence, forced vision, honor murders, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
It's going on on on the flight.
"For example, for a bottle of water to require sexual action is no rareness," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who believes that it ends as soon as they arrive in Germany, the Bahr tells.
Even here, single women in refugee accommodations would often be considered less quality and mostly abused.
This leads to the traumatization of about 90 percent of women who live in the coin in the north, she estimates.
"Some of the children are certainly not voluntary."
Many women are used to say nothing.
Or they don't trust to speak openly about the experienced because the shame is too great.
Since they often don't know how to help, more accommodation is needed for them only, Bahr demands.
In Bayern, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
On the question whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich, some answer with no.
For example, there is no such thing in the upper palace and upper francs in the governments' accommodations.
Even in swifts, women who are only fleeing are not separately dwelling, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government's press speaker.
In upper bayers, sub- and middle-franks there are floors or houses in some Community accommodations only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayers, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities also calls on women to be separated from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be stayed separately."
"If the privacy fails or men and women are placed together, there can be violence against women - continuingly".
Especially the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, the study says.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be pointed out at the spirit of the house in Munich.
"Since we have spoken around that there is us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant physicians: Requirements for new labour struggle
Deputy representatives of the Assistant physicians have called on their trade unions to approve new labour struggles in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called on its entire Council to adopt more work campaigns from the beginning of September.
The JDC said that it would have refused Ministers to deal with the concerns of the Treaty.
Assistant physicians and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the president of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "continuously quiet" to problems, resulting in the refusal of the Treaty.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board voted to completely reject the proposed new Treaty and asked for official re-treatment on all your concerns."
In response to the state's silence, the JDC Board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating labour struggle starting at the beginning of September.
The disputes led to the six-time strike of assistant physicians this year, the first overall accidents in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the BMA Assistant physician Dr. Johann Malawana returned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.
He communicated BMA members during the meetings, which were still taking place by 54,000 assistants and medical students before the vote, that the Treaty should be beneficial and acceptable.
After the vote, the health minister Jeremy Hunt said that the treaty for doctors in England would be forced.
Russia and Turkey: "A alliance of external sides"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves their hands and to announce an official end of the eight months ongoing war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterplayer in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot reject the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handcuff, yes.
But Putin's smiles seemed tiny and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restraint conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even improve themselves.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had taken it as if never happened something bad.
His enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite.
But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's Head had not forgotten anything.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the discharge of a Russian fighter at the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was madly burned.
Putin shared and accused Ankara of falling Russia in the back.
The crime was even bigger because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the vetrauen will be difficult if not even impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unlimited attack on Ankara.
At one time it seemed that the Turks would bear the blame for everything.
The most serious accusations of leading officials were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has contested this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting only took place because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could book a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the advantages of a gunstill are clearly on the hand.
Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after he was dismissed at a failing state war nearly his office last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked it.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are restarted.
They count on a late seasonal storm at the Mediterranean.
This week, public television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there long, tomatoes all over here."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry in the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempted power acquisition as a weak response.
The persistent wrestling about the pace of the EU accession negotiations and Putin, which seeks to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relations to the west.
The Russian Head of State in Ankara certainly won a bonus for calling for support for the selected state bodies after the attempted state war.
This is well-noted for Moscow a naturality that has even a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present "Alliance of Outdoors" one, as an Analyticist once described me, two countries that are violated from the west and feel badly treated and are now bound.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposed sides.
It might be noted that after nearly three hours of first reading, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even taken the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided replying to a question of its differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common necessity can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when the NATO member of Turkey suspended the Russian fighter - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State speak with each other at least again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is to be reduced to a backoffice roll, according to the bank's head of board.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been distant since then when it almost collapsed and saved eight years ago.
During this time, brand streets have used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsoring, from six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Sieger Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland, but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock notation will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for the private business that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visit tour by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He communicated to the BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be busy, as we now become more a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not following global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue his six Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sport sponsoring.
"It's time for us to develop to the bank of the brands, because how are we focusing inside (we have asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the director.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launch these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can start these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves its 3,000th profit at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey that reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-fold winner Dettori, who won at Ghayyar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I'm eased and very modest.
Dettori takes the joy when he gets the victory on Predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-month winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4.300 victories in a record breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-fold Derby winner had 4.493 career
Frankie is one of the best jockey of the moderns and it's no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which just few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and Charisma have been enthusiastic for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had already gained 6,000 wins if he was not just a weekend and big tournament yockey!
Frankie has already been at GB for nearly 30 years of winners, which is great.
He has a vivid personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition, he is an unbelievable jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the trailer of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A number of major tower wins, including his famous "Glorious Sevens" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago he had difficulty at the beginning when he returned from his six-month block, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to defeat his twins and return to his best form.
And he's not at the end for a long time - Dettori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions until the least 50th year of his life.
Russian Putin fires Chief Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unforeseenly released his staff chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was a part of Putin's closest trust circle for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a statement by the Kreml, it is that Putin has ordered "the dismissal of Ivanovs of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidium Administration without any reason".
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov's Vice-President since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.
In 1972 he was born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, graduated at the renowned State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kreml website, it is said (in Russian) that he was later Head of the Protocol and Head of Staff of the Government staff.
About his appointment he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as Head of State in terms of legislative drafts and controls in order to implement your instructions.
Putin informed the Russian TV sender on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and to recommend Vaino as his successor.
Are the smiling faces convinced?
This step has made Moscow mystery surroundings.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putins for a long time and works like him for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men in the country.
During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast in television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on their own request.
But despite smiles for the cameras, only a few are convinced here - especially now, just before Parliament's elections.
So is the result of a kind of power struggle here?
Nobody knows that right now.
But the official claim - that a man once prized as a potential President - would like to lead Russia's environmental policy at once - struck on great skepsis.
In his comments on Putin, quoted on the Kreml website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to trust me this very complex posts - you could almost say - for four years.
As it appears, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidium Administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Before he was Vice-President and Defense Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB) replacing the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his alternate.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people to whom he trusted most.
Firstly, Ivanov was assumed to be President of Russia after Putin's second term, since a third term of office of Putin had violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another, nearby allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit the producer
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute in the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produce the series, announced its announcement in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized himself on Thursday before his announcement publicly.
There were artistic differences and differences in opinion at the set.
I regret the incident," he said in a message.
Detailed information about how the character Gibsons from the series, following a team of FBI agents, is expected to be published at a later date, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios opinion.
The 54-year-old who previously played in Sitcom Dharma & Greg has been involved since the first stage of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have infested my whole heart blood over the past twelve years," said Gibson in a release published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but this will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can want for a series.
The planned radiation of the twelve staples is set on 28 September.
Puzzles about fish landing in the garden in Banff
An inhabitant of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish, which appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals that were sprayed out from a spring well.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published on Periscope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £ 1.35 billion. expensive project will be completed until May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossings to the Viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected to fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck beams", which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 screws.
The £1.35 billion of expensive project is to be completed until May 2017.
Minister Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first who went from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossings.
We are all witnesses of a engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge cover is a hot activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fitting.
Overall, almost 79% of the whole bridges are on their place and the last section of the deck is getting a betongus for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure is a major milestone for each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future high and depth construction.
After installing the last road cover section and its connection with the northern tower cover, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or landside.
This was achieved by dragging the northern bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very tough activity.
Massive, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up at a rise of about 3%.
Hekel, as the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Salvation in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "going to be alive"
Three men have "happy to be alive" after they were thrown before Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming safely while their boat continued from their own strength.
"We saw the boat turning around near them and imagined the worst," said the leader of the Moelfre Vince Jones rescue station.
"Happy the strong winds have already weighed the boat beyond their range until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found on a boje hanging without a rescue west.
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water have been lucky and still alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, it ran away from the person who controlled the boat when the boat was centered.
Someone's been waiting for these men today.
Heavily hurt - a man puts on his ex-friend
A man attacked his ex-friend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and severely injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized offender cut the clothes of his ex-friend.
When this came to the apartment, he stood on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on the hand and on the body.
The police could arrest the offender.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-friend's clothes, he called his mother.
He alarmed his sister.
Together with her associate, the 45-year-olds wanted to rest their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her associate.
On the street, they met the man's ex-life companion.
When the two women returned to the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister and attacked his ex-friend.
Who builds the cheap apartments of Braunschweig?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors will be taken much more into account in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that brown-sweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "Trafting Concept" at the next Council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
There has been a lack of regulation.
SPD Group chairman Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens: Whoever wants to build on urban areas, in the future 20 percent of all apartments must be a social apartment."
However, the favourable apartments can also be found in stock.
But the big dispute in the Council House is, Bratmann says, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still need to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann, "There is currently no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.
The left wants still harsh commitments for investors.
Regardless of what, Bratmann said, the situation on the housing market was intensifying.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's unclear whether we'll get the professionals.
However, the programme is not entirely: for the about 1260 new apartments that should be built in any way.
But how do you look like the loss of some 1,300 cheap apartments whose support will run out in the next few years?
Only until 2020 there will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, according to Nicole Palm, the planning policy speaker, is now supposed to be purchased outgoing links from the city.
In addition, it was necessary to think about bringing homes back to the price binding.
This is possible in the West Town.
At one strike, the problem was solved.
For the West Town runs out to the end of the year.
Approximately 1800 apartments you can get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.
Only: The owners, the housing companies do not want that.
Because the number of social housings in the West Town is again drasticly increased, it is removed from the goal of so-called interference.
There is no longer a concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the debate.
Group president Holger Herlitschke says: "For a wide majority, the CDU must be in the boat."
It has concentrated on more building sites for family houses.
But what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found any more.
Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness worth
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
The fact that teenagers and children don't go out to play, rather prefer to spend their leisure with staring on screens, has been complained by many in recent decades.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then limited to video games and lastly to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities are not excluded from each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s (later produced a series of characters, play cards and other spin-offs).
As many phenomena of popculture, the interest in the release of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand fell slightly early in July.
The massive demand that the server overloaded the introduction of the market in other countries has moved.
In few days Pokémon Go had more users than tinders and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, the players are going out with their smartphones and searching for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, "fotografed" (with a screenshot on the phone) or "captured" can be taken.
A generation who played the game when she was younger joined the wrath and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person returns every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people who train 30 minutes every day, from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who plays from Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public education campaigns for health that people want to "take 30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" were deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look sorrowful.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
If you regularly drive sports, reduce your chances to suffer from cancer or depression.
Body activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to add them here.
But the wonderful thing to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunlight as well as fun.
Some people end up hunting even new friendships.
As always, there are dark players who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's going on?
It's been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit had been able to follow our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to drive sports like this game.
The new one will lose its arrogance and the use will leave with time.
However, due to Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the real world’s activity, helping many people in hunting to be active, fitter and healthy.

Simone Biles creates gold in Damenturn
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Hardly on the bar.
It's breathtaking on the ground.
On the whole line brilliant.
And finally, the Olympic American.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournament became a multi-kamp title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the lights of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans Simone Biles turns on the swift bar during the single multi-kamp fiction of women in the art towers at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-kamp title and totally the fifth while she strengthens her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her end result was shown and her long journey ended at this moment.
This success is the same as unique athletes as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports types to new heights:
For the last three years, Biles has dominated its sports style, 15 World Championship Medals - including 10 Gold Medals - won with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambitiousness and precision that the 1984 Olympian Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of over-dimensional expectations.
Not returning with a handful of gold to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace themselves after each winning gold and silver in the single multi-kamp final of women in the art towers at the Olympic Summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a calling mark at the celebration of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles was trying to take her long way to the top, never plan the future, this is not really true.
A part of its soil exercises - which contain their typical tumbling pass - is voted on Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the Tour Hall, where Boorman trained, became forced.
She has no more competition since summer 2013, a victory series that will stop as long as Biles wishes.
Even if Mustafina was easily guided by two rotations, the picture was squeezed.
Swift bars and soil towers - in which Biles holds the world championship - louded.
She returned with 15,433 on the swim bar and put one on it with a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman embraced her gentlely when she expected her endergment - a pure formality - and tears floated on Biles brightly red, white and blue eyelines when the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.
The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last four years when she fought around the third place, but the bronze medal in a tiebrake went to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old teamsman, called "father" by the Americans, had a precedent.
After her soil exercise, she cast to the audience kiss hand, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As regards Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a very new significance:
Police: 3 victims in serial murder when listening to music shot in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who had died in one of the most deadly attacks for a decade in the first series murder of Phoenix while they were talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah was shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The killer fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the side of the car and then fleeing with another vehicle, is read in the report.
The police announced that the three-fold murder does not seem to have been the result of an assault, as the attacker did not take the bags or the $2,900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the mediators to get a closer look on whether they were connected with four previous attacks.
Overall, seven persons were killed and two more injured mainly in hispanic residential areas within four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, in the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white cadillac or Lincoln.
The mediators refused to disclose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died still in place.
One Witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and hear music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup druck half an hour before the three-fold murder and was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.
Measurements found cartridges and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the motor room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microzephaly: "It's gonna be better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But, like the least of his elderly, Edmund microzephalie, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't let myself do that.
What's not right at all -- of course, it's a problem," she said.
Your husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund will never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institutionalize him.
"My first answer was, 'I didn't know that the people still did,' said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with a walking help.
Edmund couldn't sit or crawl until his third year, and he can still not talk.
But he slowly makes progress.
He can run with support and bicycle.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund thought for "Please sing something for me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund has found some signs alone.
Microzephalia has a variety of causes: genetics such as Edmund and infections with viruses such as massels or the Zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts can vary strongly.
It is too early to tell how it will affect the lives of the infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked what will happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't been asking for the forecast for a long time, because I don't expect her to really tell me.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zika virus.
It's gonna be better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding causes salvation in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is estimated all Saturday with more rainfalles.
Many rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippis flooded their shores and threatened with large floods of extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and helping the municipalities concerned are already on the way.
Mike Steele, a speaker for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sand bags increased.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sand bags.
A flood warning system is used for large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service made it reliable that in this area, additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain.
In the south of Alabama, a flow-fruit warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels over the weekend.
The Meteologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could overflow many houses in the premises near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a stream downward flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, since it will only flow slowly over the rivers to the Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State Border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest position ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.
Rescue teams still picked up people from the river water into the Amite districts and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rises strongly overnight.
He said that another stepson who lived nearby had warned him.
"We are awake and the water flowed and streamed in," said Hansford.
It reached my taille.
His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said he and his family were all disabled and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were stayed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flooding had "profit spread" as there were still severe rainfall and that the authorities are slow to consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer reported from midnight to Friday morning from 13.75 inches of rain near Livingstone.
Krautmann said that the ground has been largely filled by rainfall since Wednesday.
The authorities indicated that severe rainfall and road floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and lessons loss in five school districts.
The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a companion in Tangipahoa had 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were now flooded.
The chief of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were rinsed by the water.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodation was set up to accommodate the evacuates.
"When the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their houses," he said.
In the city of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the high water and provided sand bags for the inhabitants to take them, who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy des Harrison County said it was still raining at the Gulf Coast.
According to his data, a handful of houses should have been reported as overflowing on Thursday, but on Friday no reports have been made.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "affected by balls", survives shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandparents of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents claimed that Brown suffered several shot injuries, including in the lend, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was at consciousness in his transportation to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was swallowed by balls," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the sender.
I just can't believe that.
The boy’s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the sender that he was expected to be cured again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims, according to CBS Philadelphia, are stable.
The boy was shot on the front seat of a car with the 29-year-old who is in a critical condition, reports the sender.
The other two victims weren't in the car and the police just checked if one of the injured men of the offenders could be.
CBS Philadelphia announced that there was apparently a crossfire between several protectors.
Patrone caves for storm guns, which were traced back to various storm guns, overlooked the place of action.
It seems that this was clearly a continuing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the walk, were hills.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved here," police officer Anthony Ginaldi informed the police in Philadelphia to the sender.
There were also several houses and vehicles in the area.
There was no arrest and the police are currently checking reports according to the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another six-year-old girl was met by a cross-slasher on the arm when she played before her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's Olympia team in the tournament, and that for more than one reason.
First of all, since 1984, I have been with every summer olympiade and the United States have never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tournaments, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspired many young girls in other skin colors.
The structure of this team, which Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and rounds Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has strengthened the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female tournaments was a Afro American.
Last year were Simone and Gabby #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner in the last Olympic Games.
Now the world was able to be witnessing the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as she delivered unexpected but masterly gymastic routines.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual multi-kamp event for women.
Aly Raisman won silver.
We're experiencing the top of this kind of sport, but that's how tour classes don't look around the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all joined the same way as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic Team.
They are the "last five" because the next Olympic team will have only four tournaments in the team. Furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality seems to be that tournament is a expensive sport and tournament is primarily in private tournaments that are preserved by parents who are maintained for the training, establishment, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their tournaments and families). The list can be continued anyway.
The majority of these tournaments are in wealthy premises that can support the business.
In these associations, the Turners receive their entire training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained her athletes since they started to turn.
We have to enable the communities of countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to make it easier and easier to train.
I founded my 20-year tournament.
In my events, we offered free and affordable tours in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my home city) to offer youth high-quality tours that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turns develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health and educational and vocational success.
It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the tournament and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
It's such an exciting time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by collecting the Olympic team gold and thanks, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant physicians want to organise further strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the British Medical Association's functioners, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistants who voted in a election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had announced plans to impose the contract and said that the NHS were located in a "neverland" and any further delay would be harmful for employees and patients.
The first assistant physicians are intended to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work to improve care at young hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistants, announced last night in a communication: "Assistant physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed Treaty, especially that it will heat up the current occupational crisis and refuse to treat all doctors fairly."
For only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty, progress must be made and time is out.
The BMA's efforts to solve the disputes by discussions struggled with the government for refusal to participate and sometimes to sweep over.
That happened to the promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month about his door always to be open.
"Yeremy Hunt has to act now, lift up the force and address the concerns of the assistant physicians."
If he does not, the assistants have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns.
The last strike at the end of April saw a rush of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, as nurses and specialists were included to provide doctors on the strike post chain coverage.
The ministers had hoped to be able to terminate the dispute about the changes by adopting the reformed Treaty with the British Medical Association functioners.
The BMA wants a better weekly remuneration for the 54,000 assistants subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS staff, urged the assistant physicians to stop the strike.
Mortimer said: "Arbeids struggle does not achieve anything of the lowly, but already overloaded teams and service providers and only cause concerns, distress and interruption to the patients, nurses and their families."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistants and have responded positively to concerns regarding the prematureness and the whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministeries.
The employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as dispatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a vocational exclusion, training courses, mutual recognition of the education plan, training leave and gender-specific wage losses in medicine - was a sign of how serious it was for the employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in respect of compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2 per day medicine that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefited from a £2 per day drug after the authorities were recommended to give this more people for a longer period.
The respiratory medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attack in subjects with a heart disease.
The medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or further heart attack.
The NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people each year suffer a heart attack, and one quarter of them suffers another heart attack or stroke.
Cardiovascular infarctions and strokes are caused by accumulation of fat-containing materials in the arterial walls that are contaminated.
When the convulsion breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that constipates the blood flow to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
When the blood clot is dissolved, it can flow through the blood flow and stop the blood flow to the brain, which causes stroke.
Persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.
The draft instructions of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice-day intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all those who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with desastratic consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack may have significant negative effects on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation by Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The draft instructions recommend no treatment beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness makes election fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from the Office last year on the initiation of a government report for corruption.
A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities consciously ignored as a destructive government report today revealed.
The former Cabinet Member Sir Eric Pickles instantly attacks the police, electoral observers and councils to ignore evidence of electoral abuse due to "sensitivity of ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Communial Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up block bands outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that electoral voters carry a certificate to prove their identity in the event of elections.
Nowadays, a chooser must only mention his name and address.
The report suggests that a person's finger bears non-removable ink if they give their votes to prevent a person from picking twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls on the press to have more access to local documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
"It is not only against election fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is involved," he said.
The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's election scandal in the east of London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the official mayor Lutfur Rahman should be withdrawn from corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a literany.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community"in a cynical way" and that he had brought his critics to silence with rassissmus and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman was supposed to have "run his campaign on the basis that it was the religious obligation of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation in which one person chose as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent election of letters - when the elderly members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate for their election.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the election system, including the conduct of evidence to prove the identity
His report says: "As evidence, the pressure on protective members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, in particular women and young people, to choose in accordance with the will of the elderly, especially communities with the Pakistanian or the creeping box.
"There were concerns that... government institutions would have ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity with regard to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists are editing letter election documents to stop "valves".
The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires harder registration checks to prevent the use of the election directory for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask choosers before choice for your certificate.
Use non-removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent a person from picking twice.
carry out systematic audits of the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are elective.
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic letter selection.
Prohibiting political activists to edit complete letter elections and repositories of letter choices.
The police give the power to set up blocks for election stations.
A change in law facilitating a charge for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act (Volksrepresentation Act).
Photographing ban in election stations.
Request that only English may be used in the election stations (excluding Wales).
Intensive training to ensure that employees apply the rule that choosers go to the election cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "incredible" that no criminal announcement has been made after the Tower Hamlet's case.
"The election court has explained Lutfur Rahman and his alternate representative to be inadequate because of a literacy in corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
It was known due to a number of reasons for sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the effective "decay controls" of the election registration departments of the Council houses.
Sir Eric said, "The judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of Parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the alarming and hiding spread of election fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Awakened by Kate's Wheeler Double Ganger and other famous double gangers of Olympia Sports in Rio
Fans of the Olympiade 2016 in Rio, this week, the French bike athlete Pauline Ferrand-Prevot has been advised from the edge and band, which has proved to be an impressive double walker of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic is not the only athlete that fights for gold, which has its own famous double ganger - at least not if you can give faith to social media.
To honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are flirting on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain similarity with Hollywood fame.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the U.S. team in the bow shot Brady Ellison, left, has been compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Besides Kate's double walker on the bike track, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archipelago of the twin of A-promi Leonardo DiCaprio could be.
The team member of the U.S. team in the Bogenschießen Brady Ellison has caused an intrusion on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star incrediblely similar.
In fact, the archipelago got the madness in social media and admitted that he has already been hearing that he looks like Leo since his childhood.
"I see no great similarity, except the facial hair," Brady informed the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I'm complimenting you."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly become even more central this year: the altogether similarity between the British widespringer Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with its large, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double walker for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool the South African swimming pool Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee Star Matthew Morrison for years.
One walk higher: This user is of the view that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the inception actress
Another persistent comparison was drawn between the Tennisstar Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, which shows similar severe eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova shows more than just the sun brown skin and blonde hair like the actress Annalynne McCord, while the American Nathan Adrian was certified by fans to be like a "atletical version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Stark women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the similarities.
Theory put in the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and the Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an amazingly similar face and eyes.
Further popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smiles, which are almost identical to the actor Laura Linney as well as the golden medal winner in the Gabby Douglas tour, who has her own beautiful, wide smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologize for his statement that Chinese swimmerin "as a pig died"
Byron MacDonald's Analysis on the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr 4x200m freestyle swimming staffel emphasized audiences of the CBC life transfer of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian transmitter CBC had to apologize after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "deceased like meal" and during the race like "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he released his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle booth.
MacDonald, who had been taken to the commentary team of the CBS to give more "color", was heard to say, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby".
Too excited, went off like a belly, died like a pig.
Thank you.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swimed the second stage of the swimming staircase 1:57,79 - 1,61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to unlock the gap to China.
Viewers throughout Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane seconded, "Have the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmerin from China "as a pig died"?????
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on broadcast."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-style swimmer for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with many speaking to him
Twitter-User didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC mission, apologized himself live for MacDonald's comment and said: "We apologized that the comment on a swim performance had been published."
It was an unfortunately selected formulation, we're sorry that it happened."
CBC apologize at the end for more than 90 times to people who responded to the note via Twitter
The commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and published a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been possible to spread them.
Last night, we apologized our audiences for broadcasting and our followers in social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments were referring to the performance of the swimmerin and not to her as a person.
Yet, they were unpleasant and an unfortunately selected formulation. Byron does what he said very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologize in the broadcast and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swim boot in the CBC Olympic Mission, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I'm very sorry."
Buyer in Primark embarrasssses on a woman who trys underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers didn't know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the midst of a Primark to try on subsections.
In order to worsen the situation, she mustered, as she looked therein, pulled her out and put her back into the regime.
She went on and tried four pairs of subsections in a shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The Primark business in the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the subheads before she put her back to the regime
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she went back and left the business without buying something."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
She stood on the middle of the sales area, took a couple of subsets from the exhibition, pulled out her own trumpets and hooks and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, frightened like Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she pulled out the subpoesites that she obviously didn't like, since she put her back in the rank."
She repeated the same with three other subsections before she finally decided that you didn't like anything, darling again and went out.
"They didn't seem to be disturbed that she watched someone - or thought about the person who might buy the undercoats that she had tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How foolish to think that someone would take subsets home who had another person and who were not washed."
The event occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I received, the employees tried to pull out the garments after she went - what is equally good."
"I would hate to go home with a new couple of subhoses and find out that another woman had her and went out again and she wasn't washed."
A speaker of Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in our branch in Folkstone on Tuesday, August 9th."
All products in question have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from weapon attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Verbande in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers on a close distance.
Whether you are approaching from front or back, this video will show you how to turn the spider around for your robber.
If you approach you from the back, you should turn around first so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the gun line," says Mizrachi.
Then take the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you strike it in the face with your free eelbow.
Then hit him with the knee in the bar and turn around while the attacker crawled up from pain, the gun out of his hands. Slash him with the run into the face and move backwards while they direct the gun to him.
When attackers approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, grab the gun and turn it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
Together, move the weight to the gun and strike the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of its handle before they move backwards and turn the gun on it.
Sounds hard?
Look at the video to see exactly how it looks like Mizrachi.
But remember that it's safest for a robber to overcome your money - if you're not a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveller Ian Wright creates his tongue for a guide in the most dirty places of Europe
A British traveler underwent his immune system and a sorcerer eflex of serious tests - by disposing of some of the most dirty and disgusting places of Europe.
The leader and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk created his trains on a Euro-Shin, a landing at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher of a train towel and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.
Before disposing of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he's going to do.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", revealed some surprising results.
The idea of swallowing the washing button of a train towel that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely abrupt, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen dish.
On his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of darm bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left what he dropped, more than a bad after taste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his darm by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public lands at railway stations to washing heads of toilets, the task made his immune system definitively under a sample
In the film he said: "I was relatively unaware of my health as a child, and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and mudwater."
In the film, he was justified in any case.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
Its sample depreciation showed a luminaire number of more than 4000 units.
Compared to this, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to distract after its luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film he says, "This is close to the worst thing I smoked in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to touch anything here because it's awful in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of milk products Valio.
The company is exhibiting Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of darm bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Safts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstorms that ended with saying, "Let us call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the significance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestines is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary film we have been able to provide consumers with more information on this in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the regime of the film, added: "Let me say it like that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had slicked some of the things I have instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to touch it and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've taken some of these dirty flavors on film."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all the milk acid bacteria in question associated, especially with the welfare of stomach and intestine and 58 percent asserted that they at least occasionally use products that contain accompanying milk acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delocation Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
A social family left her social apartment after a delocation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing association found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls showed pitching holes, wood pieces were scattered, waste was spread on the floor and Graffiti was shaved at the walls.
The family was relocated and it is assumed that she lives now in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repairable.
She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to take into account, as this property is probably not considered so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is famous and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and the police said that the terror that the family had added included street fights with baseball fighters, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive crying, fighting and fleeing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, got an arrangement for antisocial behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house which may be ripped, old waste was found
It was in the premises in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden pieces were ripped up
Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing delogned her and her partner this week violently from the presence, after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.
The delogy was celebrated by enlightened neighbors who said that their life was made hell.
One said, "They weren't looking for anybody."
We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.
The countless times we say to the police here are incredible.
"Today tomorrow, we couldn't sleep."
We stood up because it was so quiet here - that's not what we're used to!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called regularly for 20 years.
On the overwhelming side of the municipal house, waste and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant refused to accept any responsibility for her behavior and her family, as a deloguation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and her actions had to be terrible with her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and members of the community who have gone to us courageously and have let us get the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and the message that antisocial behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the ground in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delocation
Workers of the house managers will now have to clear waste mountains that surround the house
In 2014 the police carried through a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as waves, paraphernalias and cash of £1.700.
Skeldon received a penalty after she had known herself guilty of the possession of a drug of class B in commercial terms.
She claimed that the money was for a grave stone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.
After they were without home, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were embarrassed with Graffiti.
The police say she's going to defeat tenants who don't comply with the rules of the house.
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall informed that the delogue was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the order of the house.
"This is about those who think that they can behave without suicide and those who have been damaged by such a behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are paniced after a deep-flying militant jet beach flys
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their life
A Portuguese P-3C Orion plane of the Air Forces made an incredible crash flight
The air forces indicated that it was on a training flight, but persisted that there was no security risk.
This was the moment when terrified tourists start to panic after a deep flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane flew almost in tight vicinity over the sunshines on the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The vacationists jumped up when they, understandably, began to worry about the noise of the noise power plants without first seeing what came to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacations who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By in social media, said: "It fled really very deep twice and there was a moment as it looked like it would crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were paniced when the plane came out of darkness and incrediblely fled deep
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and thereby had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them.
The speaker said that due to the bad sights, the jet was slightly deeper than usual, but the air forces persisted that safety was at no time endangered.
Area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese continent this summer, where four people also died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong nail and fire smoking - which restricted his view.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with anxiety against Sevilla
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona fights on Sunday at the first step to the first track win in the new football season.
In Duell, the Catalans are approaching the Spanish supercup toward the FC Sevilla, the replay rises three days later in Camp Nou.
The double winner must quit Neymar in the power fair with the underlying Cupfinalist and regenerating Europe-League Champion, among others, who contests with Brazil the Olympic football tournament.
In addition, Goalie Marc-Andre is missing.
The German suffered a band degradation in the knee in training, with a clarification of the question at Barca at least first in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Steps have been racing in Barcelona for two years about the status as number one.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far rejected a clear decision and left Bravo in the Liga, but Ter Stepen in most other applications.
Before the first compulsory game of the new game, there is doubt about the fitness state of the team, which was humiliated in a Liverpool test game on Saturday with 0:4.
Even at 3:2 in the sample galoppy against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really believe.
Sevilla, again, has to dignify the 2:3 downside after extension in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and pursues the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is with eleven successes of the record winners in this application.
Ma Long in a own liga to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic One.
On Thursday, the 27-year-old conquered his countryman and "Title Defencer" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12,5,4,4) in a single final in Rio de Janeiro.
The world rankings first gathered the Golden Grand Slam with successes at WM, World Cup, World Tower and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have achieved it as expected in the end game and have become the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympia troop was the former SVS-NÖ legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Mother and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the sentences and at time-outs they had no coaches with themselves.
They had moved back to the tribe and left their protectors alone in the fair competition.
"The matches until here I played for my country."
"I play for myself in the final," Zhang said.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners posted with the China-Fahne.
The match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Afterwards, he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang only 13 points.
The superiority of Ma did not develop the expected controversial match.
However, there were enough breathtaking ball exchanges.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Wladimir Samsonov 4:1.
In his quarterly final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the White Russian had a ribbon injuries, afterwards was in medical treatment, "lastly" had to be satisfied with leak.
The Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had also become Olympia-Fether in a similar high table tennis age.
Donald Trump embarks on ′′′ in the electoral struggle
The leadership of the U.S. republics is plagued by massive concerns, including in traditional conservative states, to pay their majority.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republican Highburg Utah.
A rare moment when the multimillionary, normally large and self-safe, expressed as concerns, reported by correspondents.
After he has thrown 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing.
"We have huge problems in Utah," said Trump to evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
He was blamed for false reports about his candidate, and he reaffirmed his well-known media scolds.
Republican Highburgs Waving
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA from June, Trump and his competitor were at the same level by the Democrats, Hillary Clinton.
Other institutes do not see Trump, however, with the distance used for republikan candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered dangerous.
In an interview of the Sender CNBC, Trump answered the question, how he would like to stop Clinton's front: "Genauso, as I have done so far".
And push afterwards: "This will be either successful, or I will make a very nice, long vacation."
He doesn't do anything but "speak the truth."
If it is not enough for him to end for reasons of political correction, that is okay, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump Party should have threatened to extend money to support his election struggle, it should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the Republicans' candidates for the Congress should be more involved in the arms.
Olympia: Threest fraud in Doping Test
The IOC intends to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenia's light athletes are threatening after the second doping business in the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Unmach.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenia sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee communicated to set up a disciplinary committee immediately to examine the case.
A Kenian functioner had announced that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 metres runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported by the Doping Controllers by the team manager Kenias.
The IAAF World Association asked the IOC to provide information on the case to enforce its own investigations, an IAAF speaker communicated.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, IAAF will make an assessment," said an IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the Doping Control Station and has issued itself as Ferguson Rotich, the sample has delivered and signed," Kenias Chief de Mission Stephan Arap Soi explained.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, which was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing WM in 2015.
Four days earlier, the Kenian Leichtatletik delegate Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio games.
He is supposed to have informed athletes against money payments of his country about upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he was supposed to have been arrested when he returned to Nairobi Airport.
Kenia has been specially monitored at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping procedures.
In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target checks before the Rio games, unusual attention was made to the fact that athletes from Kenya and Russia are particularly taken into view.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exercised much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create a anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of Olympia.
As a result, the WADA Kenia took up the list of countries whose doping fight is in accordance with the rules of the WADA.
Kenia is considered a large runner nation.
The land's light athletes won most medals at the 2015 WM in Beijing.
A number of television reports from the ARD have repeatedly raised suggestions that there is easy access to Kenia Doping funds and a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last asked for a similar study in Kenya, as he had done in Russian light athletics.
It could be demonstrated that this type of sport has been ambiguous and systematically doped.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic loving couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical and fulfilled the role of Mary a youth dream.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra, headed by the Venetian Dirigent Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swarms.
We always say she's very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melodie.
It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this scenario, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all because she's musically exceptional!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says in her song, "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is wise, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"She looks very similar to me, my Italian character I have as Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
She's a very generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Dirigation is a need for him.
You see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion, and also a happy approach to life, which is really very important!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, "West Side Story" is highly active: "In this piece it's about prejudice and fanatism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York people did not want them.
These are the same topics, and they are as pronounced today as then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS, died reports in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the ballwork of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she intended to leave the war-bushed country and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that this is the risks associated with going to a war area - prevent people from ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other school girls from the East of London entered a plane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that Clinton will remain in the case of a victory in Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garlands confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader at Senat Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will be appointed the successor of the dead judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A spokesman of Reid later said that he hadn't spoken to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and he's speculating.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't make trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the US Appeal Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicans blocked the nomination of Garlands, were Lakais and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was inappropriate to the Presidential Office.
Treats want naked calendar for "wife and men"
The Treats Magazine works with the photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970's Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
The editor of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine differs from Oldschool-Playboys, as "Playboy is for men".
I'll do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks it does the Calendar too.
"We must return to the presentation of timeless and classic nakedness, where both women and men feel well and inspired by these pictures of a female body," said Shaw in a press release for the publication of the Calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit their images online or personally at open Casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality counted with mass flight
"He who doesn't adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed bags," says Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-navigorating Foundation Dialogue and World.
The Kurdish municipality of Germany accounts for tens of thousands of protection seekers flying from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be "one hundred thousand", believes the Association Chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh operation of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the Putsch attempt, the Kurdish municipality expects a mass flight to Germany.
"On the short term, I count with tens of thousands, medium-term, with a few hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and democratic opposition," says Ali Toprak of the "world" of Friday.
Because the government has already overcome Kurdish highburgs with penalties months ago, 500,000 Kurds are on refuge within Turkey.
After the puzzle, secular and opposing ethnic doors would be added.
Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that embraces refugees in its own country produces refugees," said Toprak.
The association chief complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevitian cities.
So Erdogan wanted to increase the excursion pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"You are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced over the last hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member.
The Head of Association demanded that the Federal Government "be as sharp as Austria positioned against Erdogan and its followers".
In Germany there is also a "Hexenjagd" against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks to abroad.
More Turks will search asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositional.
The brand marking as a gülen trailer destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"He who does not adapt and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed bags, also the chemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-nahing Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As reported in the newspaper on numbers of the Federal Ministry, the Turks presented the largest group of asylum rights recognised in Germany before the Putsch.
At the end of June 30, this was 11 386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all asylum authorized (39.625).
In this survey, there are no curses for war, poverty or insightlessness.
Asylum rights under the basic law are exclusively political, i.e. by government, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Go to where it hurts"
Beautiful Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals don't get anything from the summer whale struggle with - and the holidays from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.
In 2021 the country day elections will not take place directly at the end of summer holidays, the Swedish Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it doesn't go bader than before: summer holidays, heat and country-day election fight - that's biting.
The locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation.
Most of the holidays in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the country day.
There are practical problems: In the holidays, helpers who hang up the posters, blow up air balloons, distribute flyer and count voices, only drive hardly at the end.
Until 4 September 2016, the electoral and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to be able to pass over the people once again.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just started.
And this is also something: Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, now lies in surveys clearly behind the CDU.
It is exciting how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition stunning.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Head of Government, has been making a almost unavoidable electoral struggle, one looks out of his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and plucks a little with the people, just as his legendary wortcarger predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, soul ring has got cold feet, and Chancellor Merkel blames the bleeding of the AfD.
Their refugee policy, you "we can do this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidates, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make votes at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to a large customer; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis liegt in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westphalia, Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal countries," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it does not hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely fails the usual election campaigns at market places and before shopping centres with sunscreens and air balloons.
That, according to Kokert, only plays a "underordered role".
The Union has also noticed that in the country you're breaking away the base that it has to make a great effort to find a wire to the people again.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly available in the wide parts of the country.
However, the Council of the CDU voyage fighter Kokert to his competitors is also self-decisive: "You must go to where it hurts, namely where the people are: the villagest, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called its SPD to a particularly engaged election fight.
In surveys, the Social Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just in front of the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD had won with 35.6 per cent before the CDU (22).
The green, small party with seven percent in the surveys, is expected to create the jump in the country day.
They make a modern virtue from the holiday note and largely transfer their electoral struggle to the Internet.
"Online-Wahlf", calls it the National Chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green election fighters are looking for local voters among the vacations.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curves with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and also loves it.
Her impression: "Wahlurlaub in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."
B27 sanitation: Restaurants suffer from locking
At the speed with which the B 27 is refined, there is nothing to mecker.
For the representatives of the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 20.00 p.m., there is a lot of commendation.
"They've made everything quite ugly," Elvira Tetzlaff says about the Jet-Tankstelle.
This is a superteam.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be transferred planously to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time until the end of October.
It is also praised that the remuneration of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of aid infarctions.
Since the construction site was changed to south on Monday and the shutdown of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and thereby the connection to Rottenburg has been again, the traffic situation has relaxed within the place.
Citizens are now able to ride from torture from the B 27 again on both sides.
The deviation traffic through the place seems to be falling down.
"There were partially significant complaints," says the Deputy Head of Office Florian King, responsible for the transport technical management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had more traffic noise to fight because many roads searched for and trusted their Navi rather than the conveyor.
As a result, some trucks were entering in residential areas.
Since the speed limitations were not met, the municipality further demanded the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant crossings," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the spot.
There have been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was on the way with 77 hours miles in the speed 30 zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, but it has become quieter.
For businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.
Looking in the cards is not happy for businessmen.
But that the B 27 sanitation has led to turnover breaks, let everyone you ask lets look through.
However, some are more and less affected.
Whoever has to do with the "finance" less, so produces for other companies, for which the renovation has little consequences.
At the Maier car house, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest light decline", but also admits that of course "managed the course skills".
The most strongly stuck are the locals along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, former Krone, finds clear words.
This is already a threat to existence.
Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it.
The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We must be happy about any euro sales.
The sales deposits he counts on "over 50 per cent".
The road sanering has rejected its operation "by two years".
Half of his employees had to let him go.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, the policy would have responded differently.
Instead, President of the Government, Jörg Schmidt, on a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, answered with the indication that the site else will benefit from the benefits of the situation in the B 27. Now they must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.
Göhner knows of other districts where something more generous was handled.
In all cases, Göhner is sure that his site will continue to exist.
Finally, the family company has been located here since 1715, it refers to the long history.
The fact that the other guests of the family are now less frequently watching by because of the complicated transportation, he can understand.
If you can't go, it's nice somewhere else.
That his family clients come back after the finish of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt about it.
Despite the crisis with BSE and bird influencing, Göhner holds the effects of B 27-building on his expertise for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-term history.
Six months of construction, that's already brutal.
On behalf of the fight against terrorism, the laws are constantly screwed.
After recent attacks, Minister de Maizère now presents a thick security package.
But what has to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say about all that?
Thomas de Maizère gives the reconciliator.
All of his proposals are "political to the coalition partner", says the Federal Minister in the presentation of his new security package.
They don't overcome anybody.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I'm also involved.
However, as a minister of the Interior, he is located in results and in a "markable consensus" within the coalition.
According to recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizère has taken some time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are now far more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, reflected: that a new security authority is to take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU standards for air passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not also surprising.
In part, de Maizère starts a second approach to proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy inheritance for terrorist groups under punishment and take Dschihadists with double citizenship into the German passport.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
Nevertheless, he believes that this is real and does not demand anything that has no chances for the coalition partner anyway.
A few new ideas also present the Maizère.
They have it partly in itself: he plans quick procedures for dismissal and more opportunities to arrest people before dismissing.
Refugees targeted to land should have their smartphones checked in advance and publicised social media accounts for a security review.
In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum candidates, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or consciously throw away their papers in order to swallow their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally vicious.
Some things also seem unequivocal and leave questions open.
And in some points - for example in the inequality of patience - the question is: What does this really have to do with security and terrorism?
Yes, de Maizère says it is important to differ between refugees and terrorism.
But it is not possible to say that the attackers of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about safety in view of the high numbers of refugees.
And things that were deeply busy for people weren't allowed to go out at electoral times.
The internal security has been enormously focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is great.
And yes, there are electoral fights.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly positioning in the field of internal security.
In recent days, between the two parties went up.
First, a warrant dispute on the equipment of the Federal Police, then on a security-political collection of some EU Ministers for Industry, in which the Ressort Chiefs also require a Burka ban and a rejection of double citizenship.
De Maizère is also pleasant here for compassionate sounds.
He doesn't hold anything from a double pass.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
You're not going to make it new, you're not meaningful.
And in the case of a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional firm on all corners and whether it is actually "to be suspicious" for the coalition partner, it has to be shown.
There's a few things in it that could make conflicts.
However, the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
The party chief Sigmar Gabriel first signals for caution and says: "The SPD is willing to talk about everything that helps to increase safety."
People's cars are still glimpsing through.
Despite Dieselscandals, delivery numbers are rising worldwide.
But not all markets are running around.
In the callback, there is a wrinkle for a term.
People's cars start at deliveries in the second half of the year.
Although Europe's largest automotive builder has been able to present a further plus in the past year despite the diesel industry thanks to its many brands and some well-runing markets.
However, in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and again stressed the overall sales, as reported in Dax.
The VW brand sold around the world with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous month.
The sales in West Europe alone, to China the second most important market, were 14 percent below the previous month.
In the home market Germany, the deliveries sucked by almost a sixth place.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann brought the weaker figures from July mainly back to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, "changed economic conditions" have been retained.
In addition to the situation around the puzzle attempt in Turkey, the British voting for the withdrawal of the EU also stressed, one speaker explained.
In the United States, where the gas industry first escalated, there is also a minus to book.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the principally affected homemarks of the Niedersachsen are glimpsed by the Diesel Candal: after the first seven months, only a delivery minus of 0.9 per cent is available to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group sales manager Fred Kappler could continue to offer a salesplus from January to July.
1.3 percent more vehicles delivered people’s cars at this time, 5.904 million worldwide.
People's cars had manipulated gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for reconstruction in the workshops.
In the course of the reconstruction, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars does not have any negative effects.
After the reconstruction of the vehicles, fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power does not have any worsening.
The automotive builder shall, after reconstruction, issue a "security equal" certificate to customers, but do not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called on Friday in business circles.
Reasons are legal franks.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen would now guarantee his German customers a guarantee for reconstructed diesel models.
This would have confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting was held.
"VW has to fully fulfil the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
"Deviations are not accepted," said Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU).
VW has taken the guarantee that no deterioration occurs in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the reconstitution and that all type-approval-relevant vehicle values are unchanged.
People's cars themselves do not use the term "garantie", as it was called in business circles.
In the wide term "Warranty", Volkswagens sees the possibility that, for example, a half year after the reconstruction, customers can come to a workshop with a motor damage - and this could lead to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
It is also important in the customer interest to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the gas scandal, as it said, in the case of possible guarantee schemes.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "garantie".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at the Tegernsee requires rich sparers in the future punishment rates - as the second institution in Germany.
Bank chief Joseph Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers parking 40 million euros on giro or day money accounts."
The German Banks Bundesverband speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it: normal sparers "do not have to be afraid of paying for their Spargross penal interest".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 per cent penal interest.
This fee demands the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September from private and business customers for deposits over 100,000 euros to Giro or day money accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He has been watching 40 million euros for some time, which could be picked up from one day to another and which he couldn't use.
"They are with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs," said the bank manager.
"I can't put 4000 euros for every million."
The cost is now being continued in accordance with the contamination principle.
It would be too dangerous to leave the cash money in the tresors of the Raiffije Bank: "I've already experienced four assaults, I don't have the fifth yet!" said the banking board.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few went to other banks.
The Association of Cooperatives of Bayern stated: "The extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks".
To be carrying them alone, "is not possible in business economic terms".
Some German banks have therefore increased their charges for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalties for deposits from three million euros, the Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its Skatbank-Filiale 2014.
Michael Kemmer, head of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay on a comprehensive basis for deposits, there is much too much to compete in Germany under banks and savings banks."
A banker said that there is "a client that is a little more prosperous of the assets".
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if she watches free money.
The 1911 founded cooperative bank Gmund has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, famous actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The Bayern Association of Cooperatives "is currently not known for any other banks to calculate a remuneration for deposits of private customers," said Sprecher Ernst.
The president of the Federal Association of the German Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had explained at the end of June: "The threshold to go to negative to the private customer is very, very high".
Competition is hard, and it threatens the immigration of investors to compete.
The customers in Germany will not be pleased in the width.
Destination plates: Who actually buys sound plates?
Single men in the middle of age love plates.
Before you hurry to the commentary part to oversee him under the Pseudonym NotAllOneMmännerMedlerenAlters with raw offenses, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the widespread resurrection of sound plates is not due to a tree in Millennials that wants to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgy.
Those who have recently purchased a plate are all intentions in the ages between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is not also a horn by hobby collectors - it has a emotional significance: older plate buyers keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But do you agree with the results of YouGov?
If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a business street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and stealing wild before I stay, keep my hands and say something definitely like: "So, let's throw a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even if the heart of Soho slowly embraces his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic record special shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in the immediate vicinity of various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men medium-age) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight men mid-age, a woman, probably around 20), is a day due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, do I ask?
"I appreciate it," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I wasn't followed him home), clothe the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he couldn't afford when they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and pleaded.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old. Things where I probably was too young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are rather introverted and like spending alone time, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.
That's my loader.
Wez, 25 who works at Sister Ray also believes that many of the customers he meets will apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and are getting to buy their old plates again.
From the conversations I have conducted, people have usually completed their collection by 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy themselves CDs now sell their CDs to buy themselves again their records," he says.
That would explain the tree to trailers of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to see that plate shops offer a calm community of equality.
According to Wez, some of the older clients took the attack on the contactless payment system.
Some plate fans are overwhelmed by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar sound plates, of objects that awaken happy youth memories.
"I think it may sometimes be a kind of comfort to fill an empty or possession of material property," says Wez.
That's what I'm collecting, and I think it's like it's for many people.
It is a simple way to work spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" one employee flew from a plate stake.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.
The survey also found that 41% owns a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate do not have a record player.
At that time of the news report I would probably look very worried while browsing through a bunch of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men in the middle of age), has noted a "thropheen aspect" of the Revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said, "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radio head record so that I can put it into the regal," he says.
This is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More product-resistant, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who dedicated the sound record to almost a whole floor, has a bunch of audience when I enter.
There are couples around 70, tourists who take pictures, teenagers and women in the middle of age.
Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz drills from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity in the customers.
No one of them looks extraordinarily lonely, but nasty psychic traumas are difficult to detect when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes and considers the variability of the records for sale.
She's making a shower bummel rather than a big shopping.
She doesn't deserve much, so the collection of plates is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is..." she drives off with a loved soaper.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of plate lovers should have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to muster the Jeans-Hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley plate player.
To the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at it - perhaps because they're just decorative, some so far above that it's impossible to touch it.
It's pure plate art.
But given that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send for more sohos to the depths, there is nothing to complain.
It is not surprising that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most for luxury items such as plates.
Although my research showed that the results of YouGov are voting, they, at least in plate shops in Soho, leave the large number of female collectors and plates lovers who exist in reality, record shops and online fores.
These people probably work hard in school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday tomorrow with bumbling through plates of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while avoiding the staring view of an incredible, 30-year-old false modern, who over the shoulders doesn't sweep out of men of the middle age.
The Greenland Hai is the longest living wrestling animal - Video report
Scientists say that the greenland shark has the longest life span of all the wrestling animals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who examines the shark, says that the record was with a woman who assumed that it was between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long.
French court rejects the offer of departure from businesses in the jungle of refugee camps
A French court has rejected a offer from the authorities in Calais to rip down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be empowered to break down 72 provisional transactions in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, provide freezer services or tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture Calais argued that these places should be cut down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and sanitary risk.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that the businesses and restaurants were important, since the free meals offered by the State-supported association and other groups would not offer sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also explained that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for exhibiting people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely concludeable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than feeding only people who live "in extreme precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the Niederrissen was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in a public service, offering 200 meals on the day, English and French classes, and a advice on asylum matter for the hundreds of protective, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to protect the kids' café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure "was a disaster for these children, of which the last eight years are old."
The two help organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of those living in the Dschungel have increased to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new immigrants during the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic Cyclopedia, Radprofessor Tony Martin does not want to be undermined.
"I continue to keep the WM in sight, remain confident and fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He has no explanation for his miserable 12th place on the sugar hat.
"I really find it hard to comment on yesterday's time driving," said Martin.
He had to analyse in peace the reasons that had led to debakel.
In October, Martin wanted to fight for the titles at the time-run WM in Katar.
"I'll look at everything that we've changed in recent times."
"In addition, my position also counts," wrote the three-time world champion who lost on Wednesday at 54.5 km more than three minutes on Olympian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund misses halffinale
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in Rio's quarterfinal: The world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-nr.
34) the halffinal of the Olympic tennis tournament.
She, who was plagued by back problems, could only do her look once and acted powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, the medal hope Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) had the chance of jumping into the predecessary round.
The Australian-Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (nr. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had taken a medal (Silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB-starters in the quarterfinal of summer games had last been available in 1992.
A German duo was never in an Olympic single halffinal.
Group increases at start-up for live video game transfers
Looking at other people when playing video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam that specializes in this hobby.
The amount of money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can look at others when playing, but also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up to players missions and provide enemies and equipment.
The Player Activision Blitzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of the E-Sport.
On the way to the global media event, help Facebook.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the start-up, who have so far seated in Seattle in the U.S. Federal State of Washington, move to the Microsoft Headquarters in the California Redmond, as Beam co-founder and chief Matt Salsamendi announced.
Therefore, for the customers, nothing should be changed by taking over.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought in 2014 by the online dealer Amazon - for nearly one billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany's Raser must set itself to the next generation speed meters: in various federal countries, including Hessen and Brandenburg, new lighting devices are tested which are intended to be particularly effectively transmitted.
For example, the futurist Enforcement Trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used on accidental issues where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limitation with a stationary lighter at autoways or to sanating bridges with temporary speed limits.
However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or excessive.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: His battery holds five days at uninterrupted measurement, the case data are encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded over several traces at the same time.
Variable speed limitations as well as transit bans by time, tracks and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In a high-risk state, you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with an appendix.
In order not to be simply stolen, it has been reduced in the measuring operation, so the wheels disappear in the panted and also shot-safe outer shelter.
In addition, a built-in alarm system aims to protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and now also used, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities also flash with the new technology: France has recently ordered 100 pieces after a order of 150 pieces last year.
UK collects silver in the 7-Rugby after Fiji MasterClass Gold
The impressive performance of Britain at the 7th Rugby came to an abrupt stop at the final on Thursday evening at the last detention in the form of Fijis when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-sticking, backing, line run and red force to win gold - their first Olympia medal of any colour.
The defeat was spoiled by the not too bad comfort price of the silver medal - the fourth of Britain that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they slaughtered New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the box, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one British will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's chief trainer Ben Ryan, former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way behind him.
Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
They lost only one here.
This slop will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs fall out of spass.
It seemed to the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau overheaved the corner.
With another four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he converted.
12-0 and GB have hardly touched the ball.
An exquisite thanks from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nakarawa reaching a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua killed a touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new since the repetition and there was still over a minute play time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou preached through further weak thanks from the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learns.
That's how it is.
GB carried out fundamental changes in half-time and closed the Fijin gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed after a brilliant intermediate play by Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game left for a long time in favour of the South Seasulaners whose fans sang, swifted flags and danced on the tribun.
It wasn't hard to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-tuble with another attempt in the last seconds.
The Pfiff drowned, the Fijis embraced, and GB kicked destructively in the races.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the 20-5 halffinal, and the UK drew South Africa into a narrow halffinal game from the race - the UK's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the box forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and reached a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late thanking by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer to robbery
There will be no emotional gold than in these games and that will be something to say.
From the first robbery to the last, 220 hard hives that enter the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there were only the two who were sitting on the robber, there were three voices in the boat. The Echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all in the world when they robbed the second Olympiague in the twoer without taxwife, the first women in the history of British sports, which laid such a scale.
Her dominance was absolutely, yet its 39th unfeatured effort, which is also unexecuted.
What we see are two brilliant athletes that glide over the surface with the elegance of swines, which does not reflect the type of triumph at all.
Behind every gold in the row, a bataillon is located on voluntary helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no more helpful than the trainer who knew 30 months ago if he would survive at all this day than cancer was diagnosed in him.
As he said he was a risky one.
I had blast cancer that is surgery and they did that.
If you don't, he spreads out everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It's a little changing the view.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, what took the interruption to a minimum if it was the right term under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to go better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rudering on itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the incompatibility of the victory, her first thoughts about Williams, who spent a nervous morning with it something more than anything else to talk and tried to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was head of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was a emotional wreck this week. This may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so a lot of thanks goes to him, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have wanted a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm that couldn't hold their opponents.
Even in the last 500 metres when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to join them, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen called "blive in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to be broken.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to make something tolerable.
We didn't want a firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a time for a year before it will make decisions about his future.
Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic American.
It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
For 31 years an example of clarity
The manager of the Water Purpose Association "Veitenstein Group", Ruppert Göller, goes to retirement.
The association is considered to be "premature throughout the country".
A small franchise drinking water composition as a model for the large water producers.
So it was called in the original tone some time ago in a contribution from the Bayerian radio.
Shortly later, the water forum of the government of sub-francs appreciated the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group was "boying around as an example".
After all, Rupert Göller, who was a 31-year employee, is 28-year manager.
He was now adopted in retirement at the age of 65.
The Veitenstein Group's drinking water consortium, located in Kottendorf, the Breitbrunn municipality, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water each year and provides 32 places and Weiler with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach.
For other cities and municipalities there are water delivery contracts.
The current Chairman, Breitbrunn's Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was posted as a waterguard in 1985 and was appointed as the Managing Director of the Purpose Association in 1988.
"Their tasks have been very diverse and have been extended from the water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, the preparation of budgets, the calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman.
As outstanding events, it called the entry and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the field of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the renovation of the high containers (1999), the reconstruction of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipelines.
There has not been any silence and you have repeatedly taken up new innovations because water meant life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her Laudatio she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he lived the water purpose association regularly as if it was his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he had been allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group to reduce nitrats before the waterforum of the district underfranc.
He has received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller of his part praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterguard and he was a faithful button.
Together we were an inconsistent team.
As highlights from his viewpoint, he referred to the well-construction and restructure of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the hardest effort were, however, the breach of the tube on the high container at Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here, at minus 17 degrees will have to work throughout the night so that the villages could be provided with water.
Also, the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once because you filled Pettstadt’s high container with cakes.
The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Sturmer from Lauter, who joined Rupert Göller.
The sopranist Anna Netrebko openly deals with the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognised in her son, she believed that she had to die.
But the eight-year-old Tiago had come well forward and now learns privately in New York, where there are the best therapeuts.
"To give an example: If I ask him something that's two years back when I sang at the Milan Scala, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the Bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship State in Bargeheide - Man shoots on a lifemate
A 35-year-old man shot his partner on Friday at 10.45 p.m. in a multi-family house in Bargtheide (Creis Stormarn) and hurt her deadly.
"The man himself called and indicated that he shot his associate," said one police speaker.
The offender is on the escape, after him is publicly given.
Meanwhile, all over the ground, because Sven S. could be on the way with the car.
The man is about 1.80 meters large, muscular, brown and has a glazing.
Now the police published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man wears a glazing.
I don't want the man to be spoken directly.
He can still wear the gun with him, so the police.
If you see Sven S., call the 110.
The police are talking about a relationship state.
The victim was the year 1988, the acter 1981.
The police responsible in Lübeck did not initially want to make any information about the tatherway or the relationship between the victims and the victims, but it confirmed that a man had been killed.
"It's a killing delict."
"We don't say more at the moment," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
Eye witnesses believed that a special action command was at the crime scene.
Steel - Light View for German steel industry
The crisis-exploited and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens threatened by the industry from the ecoflow funding are from the table.
It remains with the liberation of the Renewable Energy Environment in the stock plants for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really happy that after two years of tough negotiations we have finally achieved it."
Therefore, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers, using gases from the high oven for the production of electricity for their own consumption, for the case.
According to the German Branch Association, the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel said to the WAZ, there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, a EEC surplus of 20 per cent falls.
But these are not also raised in the steel industry.
The IG Metal welcomed Germany's agreement with the EU Commission on own electricity production.
This largely defines the status Quo of the previous regulation.
The successful efforts of Gabriel have particular importance for the steel industry.
"In terms of our campaign 'Steel is the future', this is a first step."
"More have to follow."
"In the reform of the Emission Rights Trade, climate and employment targets are also considered," explained IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
Last year, the situation was deeper than the world's largest producer country in China, given the weakening domestic demand of massive steel on the world market.
European manufacturers are proposing Chinese steel companies price dumping.
During this spring, the situation has been somewhat relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties on steel have been shown to have effect, and, secondly, the economic prospects in China have been cleared.
The sustainability of price recovery is unclear.
The German branch Primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Lastly, prices would have stagnated again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not last want to exclude the closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, some 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced nearly six percent less raw steel by 3.4 million tonnes than in the previous month, as the Economic Association of Steel announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now decreased the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been by two percent below the previous year.
In the coming months, the association calculates thanks to improved contracts with increasing emissions.
Community, Spirit, Health: Sing does Seniors good
The singing has been accompanied by Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl she was at the school board, at the school office she proved the specialist music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior chor.
"Sing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, cheerful and totally more alive, she says.
Besides, she is doing something good to her health and spirit.
Because singing is just from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music with equals, describes Hackler.
The regular association allows seniors to link and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures are resolved at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Speak and organise, rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of association".
Sing can be difficult in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because it trains seniors a deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly demands his lungs does not get out of the pump in everyday life.
Even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in the age, singing is an optimal hobby.
For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organizations.
In the elderly generations, the joint singing had a much higher job value, it belonged to the everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or hearing songs in elderly people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song texts and especially melodies, people who are degraded from disorders of long-lasting events.
When singing, the head is also required for a special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition of singing in the choir, Hackler says.
An enthusiastic audience is a great commendation.
The sense of self-value also grows by singing in the choir.
To show yourself: If I practice for a long time for something, I will be better and wake beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
Good reasons to start singing, so there's enough.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he meant to have little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who already hears when you go a tone?
In search of the appropriate offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the acquaintance circle sings in a senior core, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the chorns in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can turn directly to the municipality or the chief of the church.
Many senior chores can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the Internet investigation.
If you want to sing, you should join a choir, Hackler advises.
Sing does the soul good and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than cats on the cry of the virgin animals
Biologists have studied the effect of calling catsbabys on adult animals in Hannover.
To their surprise, the maizes did not get cold, but they were always the same as the females.
Female cats can recognize the excitement rate of catsbabys at the Miauen of the little ones.
They respond about ten percent faster to the sounds of cattle who are in great need, as scientists have found out from the veterinarian University and the Medical University Hannover (MHH).
Kater also responds to the calls of cats - but always the same.
"The acoustic differences between the Miauen of less and strongly raised young animals are apparently not perceived or not of significance for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
It is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the BMC Evolutionary Biology specialist magazine.
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and sound height of the cattle cry differ from the urgency of their need for assistance.
A total of nine adult cats and eight cats were observed from the animal holding of the MHH.
They were played for a call by little ones who were taken out of the wormbox for three minutes and separated from mother and sisters.
On the other hand, they were faced with screams of stronger cattle, which were further lifted up.
In spite of the small sample, the researchers consider their results to be significant.
"All females, even those who have not yet had their own growth, responded differently to the cry," said conerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when this reputation played the very harder cats.
This ability may be born or developed with the maturity.
"A surprise was that the males have responded at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitive to babies, whether they were mothers or not, the biologist Marina Scheumann reported.
Podolski grabs Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football team in Turkey.
In Turkey a prison order has been adopted against the first football star Hakan Süküur.
He is proposed to be a member of a terrorist group.
The first time after the pussy attempt, a major football game will take place in Turkey again.
Before the Duell of the Erzrivals between Besichtas Istanbul and Luke Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly stated: "Business as usual".
Already in the event of the exceptional state after the attempt to break in July, the government was not supposed to be affected by normal citizens.
But this is not true of those suspected to belong to the movement of the preacher Fethullah gullen, which is made responsible for the pocket attempt.
It does not hold in front of the football.
On the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the state prosecutor appointed a warrant.
Thus, the squirrel that is now living in America is forced to be a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür should be a follower of the Ecclesiastes Fethullah Gülen, who is given responsibility by President Repe Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the exceptional state, for 90 days, applies until October, it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "Democratic Guards" on public places throughout the country, Erdogan declared to be completed on Wednesday.
Sports is - like the whole country - divided into trailers and opponents of Erdogans.
Especially fans of the Worker Club Besichtas are traditionally not among the friends of the President.
But what is the great part of the Turkish in view of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military bushes.
There are even the fans themselves agreed - whether their heart strikes for Galatasaray or Besichtas.
For Pokalsieger "Gala" it will reappear to Luke Podolski.
His sports value proved the Cologne during the expiry season: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first playtime as the top scorer of his association.
In the final game against Fenerbahce he reached the 1:0 victory.
The newspaper "Fanatic" celebrated him, "He was the best in the place."
He completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the Pokal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record champion found a pleasant conclusion.
After the pre-runding K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also expelle early in the Europe League.
In the Süper Lig it was only rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The Pokal was the only way to win something.
"We've done that and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besichtas, the game year went better.
Especially thanks Mario Gomez, who, with 26 seasonal hits as Süper-Lig-König, put the base to the 14th title.
That is also why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
In this context, Gomez, who was under contract at AC Florence and borrowed to Besichtas, had announced after the puzzle attempt not to return after his EM vacation due to the political situation in the country.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he only needs to say it," quoted the specialist magazine "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman.
However, the storms had to be prepared to quit about one third of their annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman stated: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite Doping: These athletes still have medal chances at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already two times locked for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other transmitted light athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight for medal in Rio.
The topic Doping still determines the headlines for the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who, after a doping sphere, had charged her right of start just before the games, was graciously pulled out and buried at her start (100 meters of chest).
It offered a curriculous scenario: With a smiled smile she was still stolen in the hall and provoked with her appearance.
When it was found that they wouldn't get gold, the audience broke out into a joyful tower.
But there are still many other athletes who start despite the doping process in the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staffel/USA): The 34-year-old belongs to the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He was already two times locked for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the 2004 Olympic Champion and ex-world champion runs even faster than before, he is more than 100 m in 9.80 seconds the world's number one and is considered to be the largest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Price (100, 4x100-m-staffel/Jamaica): The double Olympic and seven-fold World Champion in 2010 had to sit down a six-month block after she had been demonstrated the intake of oxycodon.
She had severe tooth pain after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatien): In 2011, the 2012 Olympic Age, the 2013 World Championship and the Europe Master were tested positively for the prohibited Stimulan Mediterranean methylhexanamine.
Perkovic contests the scientific intake and was blocked six months.
The four most wide-ranging baskets this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-staffel/USA): The Beijing Olympic and double world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and had been locked 21 months.
A penis magnification tool had been responsible, Merritt insisted.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 metres the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly one athlete was known so many medals afterwards.
Thus, Tichon lost his WM title from 2005 nine years later after his testosteron doping was detected.
The 40-year-old also had to release Olympia silver in 2004 because of steroid dopings and the 2006 EM title for testosteron abuse.
He also received the bronze medal of the Olympic Games in 2008 due to a judgment by the International Sports Court of Justice of CAS.
With 80,04 m, he is on rank two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km Going, China): World recorder and gold favorite were tested positively only in May, but can still start in Rio.
The 29-year-old World Champion was found indications of the use of a prohibited food supplement, the blocking of the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, was mild and expired on 13 July.
Bombing Terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Multiple Tote
The Austrian message in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday.
She suffered cutting wounds and had been treated in the hospital but could have already left it again.
She planned her home trip for early September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.
In this respect, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, so Schnöll.
In about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, Hua Hin first exploded two bombs on Thursday night in an outdoor district.
According to the police, a Thai countryer had been killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Thus, on Friday early, two grades of explosion went up again, according to the authorities, another person was killed.
Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the early years.
A taxi driver was injured at the detonation near the holiday beach Patong.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded that killed a city employee.
According to the authorities in a flower beet, the explosion rate had gone to the air before the coastal police district.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several damaged ones.
One is going from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, said it.
"The bombattentats wear the same handwriting," said Armegeneral Danai Kritmethavee Friday before journalists.
"We assume that it is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to express itself to possible motives - but it is probably the acts of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to identify a pattern typical for the bombattentates of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
On the other hand, the Thai police explained that the attacks are not related to Islamic rebellion movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotages that are limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were put by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received secretary references to future attacks in the south of the country, but they had not been informed about the exact time and locations.
Be still unclear which group stands behind the attacks.
The police invited their officials throughout the country to strengthen security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and pleasure districts.
In Thailand there are always smaller bombing attacks, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin, there is a palace used by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej for years.
Following the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities should be followed.
High security risk (Security Level 3) paid for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations, pre-requisite travels to these provinces are advised.
Increased security risk (Security level 2) is valid for the rest of the country.
The attacks took place on Thursday and Friday a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution prepared by the military junta.
This also gives great influence to the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chef and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism.
The militaryunta, which had taken power after a phase of bleeding distress in 2014, helps itself to have led the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not been able to handle the rebellion of Muslim rebels that has been swelling in the extreme south of the country for years.
In the conflict more than 6500 people have already been killed.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hindu scream – most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "Identitary movement" has been advised in the Visier of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection.
According to several national offices, the Constitutional Protectors in the Association have also monitored the group.
"We see at the 'Identitary Movement' points for pursuits against the freedom of democratic rule," said Constitutional Protection Chief Hans-Georg Maaßen von der Deutschen Press-Agentur in Berlin.
Thus immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffamated in extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement now.
The "Identitary Movement" is a group of French roots that have been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and "lost of its own identity by excavation".
Constitutional protectors in nine countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Saxony and Thüringen - are already watching the "Identities".
Maaßen said that his authority had agreed closely with the national authorities in the decision.
"Groups like the 'identitary movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Constitutional Protection Chief.
Generally, extremists try to talk to them with youthful language, often with popping music.
This is what Islamists do as well as legal extremistes.
That's not a funny advertisement for your own thing.
Propaganda is supposed to call people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable there.
That's dangerous.
Recently there had been reports from several federal countries on contacts between the "identiaries" and AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he didn't have any knowledge about this.
For constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind should be relevant only from a certain point of view.
It is important whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its target direction by certain people who are extremist and become so extremely extreme.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have taxing influence on the party.
This is not recognised.
In view of the clear increase in legally justified crimes and attacks on asylum candidates and refugee accommodations, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But in recent years we have found that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may be that further legal terrorist groups or smallest groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other legally extreme motives.
However, a German-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not evident.
The previous groups have been created at regional level or in social networks.
As a matter of concern, maizes expressed their concern that many transgressions went on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects of assaults on asylum accommodations had not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or attendants of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that had nothing on the hat before with legal extremists that might have been politically indifferent or, for example, have chosen CDU, SPD or Left, which, however, have radicalized themselves by the right-extremistic voting process."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes the Internet hot
The Olympics or World Records do not always determine the headlines of the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros had in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimming of Ethiopia swimed so slowly that he was temporarily out of sight in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected.
In the social networks Habte then became the viral Internet heat.
In fact, the 24-year-old with a 48-second back-up ends his precursor and settled the 59th place of 59 startners.
However, it was rather his not just sports figure that drew attention to the international media.
Why do the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special right to start by the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming more known in subrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethopia, have just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
Soon the first nicknames made the round.
Some media called him "Robel of the Whale".
The English boulevard "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" made fun of him.
His time, he first hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of freestyle, didn't matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
In the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani was in a medium-sized course.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to arrive alone in a precursor of over 100 meters of freestyle.
Moussambani was then advocated to the frenetic.
The 22-year-old at that time learned to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never completed so long distance before the race.

Geretsried - The owner of a store at the New Place has been ordered.
According to the police, the 67-year-old rider had left her business on Monday at 17.30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15 o'clock, the box had disappeared around 250 euros.

Trump does not see the threatening election defeat so closely
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a electoral event in Florida.
If it's not going to happen to the US President, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going to the vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential elections in November, it would be relatively important to him: "At last, it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long holiday," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV broadcaster CNBC.
If it is not enough for him to end for reasons of political correction, that is okay, said Trump.
So he referred to the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic State Terror Milis (IS).
Within his party, more and more opposition was formed.
Post increases in trade with electric transporters
An electric vehicle of the German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the companion seems to be great.
The post plans to sell her electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
Soon the group wants to start trade with the transporter.
The post will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market from the coming year.
"We want to go into the sale to third parties," said a post-speaker on Friday.
For months, the company has checked whether it is intended to sell its own developed StreetScooter, with letters and packages, to other companies.
Post director Jürgen Gerdes had said that there are always demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to the news Magazine "The Mirror", the Bonner Group wants to step up in the mass production of the vehicles in a short time.
In the post-owned manufacturing, the company plans the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and layer.
Gerdes had announced that the group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and to make a full change to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will make a very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the whole fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK leadership is derived from disappointing business numbers
The GfK consumer research company exchanges his boss Matthias Hartmann.
The retirements came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the GfK market research company made it clear that the chair of leader Matthias Hartmann becomes more uncertain, the longer the success promised by him remains.
Turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business numbers and the retirement of the management, the global number Five of the industry is in front of a personal restart.
CEO of the GfK wishes to leave the company by the end of the year.
The Chairman of the CFC Supervisory Board of Arno Mahlert shall, with effect on 12 September, exclude from the Supervisory Board.
The leadership in the board took over Mr Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, informed the company.
He would officially take the function of a "chairman" until a successor was found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "different views" on long-term business policy orientation.
Details did not want to mention a business speaker on Friday.
Who will in the future lead the market research company is still unclear.
In investor circles, on Friday, the shareholders were last disappointed over the remaining successes of the restructuring launched years.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the GfK-spitze since 2011.
"The fruits of restructuring are not yet seen after 5 years," said it.
Given the last bad GfK business numbers, each shareholder becomes somewhat uncomfortable.
"If that was the case with BMW, the Quandts would do so," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss trip even in the second quarter of 2016 after relapsing in the previous quarters.
At 361.2 million euros, the turnover was 6.1 per cent below the level of the corresponding quarter of the previous year.
As regards the first half of the year, sales by 721.2 million euros decreased by 3.4 per cent.
The profit in the second quarter has, above all, stressed the reduced value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
In the business sector of Consumer Experience, the 139 million euros needed to pay a loss of EUR 148.2 million to the group under the line.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had generated a group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus runs out in crumm horns in graves: eight injured
In an accident of a bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhorn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered severe injuries, the police announced.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to deviate her information as a result of an encountered loader, partly driving on the motorway.
The bus came right from the street and rushed into a grave, as a spokesman of the police Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"When the bus was located, the people couldn't leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire warrior liberated the inmates.
Six rescue cars and a note car came to the accident site on the Landstraße 2.
The uninjured travelers were brought back by a linen bus to the Krummhorn district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
The mediators invited the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The charges per cubic metre of waste water from 1 October 2016 for the area of the water supply Neudorf/Reuth/Walschenkahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 Euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 Euros (a.k.a. 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.64 Euros (a.m. 2.18 Euros).
At the Azendorf installation, the waste water fee will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an excessive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be EUR 4.37 per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, in the approval of the budget by the Culmbach State Council, it was found that there are coverages for these wastewater plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged on a legal basis to operate the plants costly.
From 1 October 2016, citizens, as well as business and industry companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to take deeper into the money bag.
The rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As management director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the body, a recalculation of the charges for wastewater plants of the market community was necessary.
For the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or coverages from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The serious increases in charges found Schmidt to deal with relatively small facilities with a very small waste water attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenditure on the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.
In addition, waste water was slightly reduced in all three plants.
In addition, in the falling period of the calculation, all three plants have not last been charged to a significant extent due to their age of renovation and repair expenses.
The plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth, and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged in the wastewater plant Azendorf due to damage.
In the pump plant Welschenkahl, the nearly 20-year-old support plants had to be retained on grounds, and at the pond clothing plant Lopp, after nearly 20 years of operation, the first dressed oak had to be baked, the cliff was disposed of, and an additional ventilation possibility was built in order to meet water laws in the future.
Schmidt: "Their extraordinary expenses resulted in the continuing maintenance and maintenance costs to be taken into account in accordance with the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the low waste water attack in the three plants, the cost of the operation and maintenance was "to be fully covered".
In addition, Schmidt added that the market community remained evacuated from large entertainment costs in wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for the abovementioned plants is considered to remain precarious by stone houses on a permanent basis, since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal waste purpose association cannot be extended to these installations because it is a lack of facilities.
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that the inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, as positive 0.2% were booked.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% according to the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (Juli 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016 a price increase was observed compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
The prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile, household equipment and routine expectations (0,5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained in alcoholic beverages and tobacco as in the previous month; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricate
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identitys in such a way that already limits to absurdity.
You can turn into an ananas, a dog or a figure that could be painted from a Roy Lightenstein.
The filters are unblooded, property rotating tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All failures come to the public.
Snapchat filters have taken criticism in the past, in which they were accused that the App Blackface would promote or white skin as beautysideal.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that had their castle eyes, false teeth and dunched wings, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "Gelbsight".
They wondered whether these repeated controversy points to a bigger problem that the company has a diversity.
The news and the disorder were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: The filter was considered to be hommage to anime character and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced Rassissmus reminded the filter of harmful clichés.
Others decisively rejected the Anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Savepani, a Korean-American art student whose Tweet was widely spread over the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and gentlely said unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the opposite transposition of a very unfair Asian caricatur and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the degrading extremity.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stunning wire.
The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are different in the matter of race than their older counter players - could rather go out of expecting sensibility.
When one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is insulting for a user, "so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to remove her Snapchat account, others invited to do the same.
In a record for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in setting practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership, and finished her set with a hash day: #DeleteSnapchat.
"They either have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their crew, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what to say about it."
Others share their views, a complaint that Snapchat has left mostly unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its residence and indicates its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but, according to one speaker, the company recently set up a person responsible to focus on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said on her side that she would have her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if she needs more users like us to say that this isn't OK."
Military management counterfeit ISIS Secret Service Information, establishes the Congress Committee
Military members of the United States Central Command changed information in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic state in Iraq and Syria as it had allowed the actual conditions on the spot, an examination committee reported in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, drawn up by a task force of the Republican members of the Army Committee, Secret Service Committee and the Military Budget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service Analysts, who reported how superiors changed their opinions on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The news service information, typically nicked by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual conditions on the spot and were constantly more positive than analyses of other news services," quoted a newspaper article in the report.
"What happened at Centcom is inappropriate - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the Representative House, stated.
The leadership errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-sided report shows in detail consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training of the Iraqi armies.
Although there is no direct evidence that government heads under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts saw pressure exposed to their pre-laws to a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many central command press releases, opinions and statements were significantly more positive than that of the facts," the report found.
For example, a Centcom member announced publicly that a military re-retrovery of Mossul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress Member of Kansas, in an opinion.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the heads of the Central Command changed the news service reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans called the Task Force to life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations are continued.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Democratic members of the news service team published their own knowledge on Thursday, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In the years 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of information service assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi Security Services", announced the highest Democrat in the Committee, member of the Representative House Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "waited the publication of information services reports," damaged the moral under analysts and "was excessively little room for different opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats indicated that they did not find any evidence of the intervention of the White House in the Centcom Analysts regarding a "determined political opinion".
The preliminary results of the Congress's investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the general inspector of the Pentagon, which had been taken after complaints by Centcom Analysten.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on reports of the Congress while the investigations of the General Inspector are still in progress.
But he also stated that "Expertes sometimes have quite different opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data and that the news services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have reactions beyond the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim which is now made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).
However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush, against the recommendations of many analysts, only saw a small crew troop in Iraq and took little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, notes that, in contrast to the government's statements, airships against the raffiners held by the Islamic State, there were no significant effects on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional raffins had taken into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, reported the Times in September.
Centcoms then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative because of his excessive positive assessment of the battles in a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with the UK stands ahead
One day after she shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five gates in two games should actually represent a thoughtworthy performance, but Bam (27) said that they could not remember that ever done.
"I have no idea." she said.
I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.
However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic fight and are equally in their group with the British in the first place, which remains unavailable after her 2-0 victory against Japan.
Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinal, the game will decide which of the two teams within their group will get the first and second place each of them.
The first placed one will take the strong Dutch women a little longer away from the way that leads the other group.
Whatever the game ends on Saturday, the Americans have caused a surprising wrestle through their success story, four years after they landed at the last of the London Games on the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time, three years, she had a hockey attacker in hands (their two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), 16 years old she became a national player in the United States, the most recent in the history of the team.
She missed the Olympiade in 2008, as she couldn't qualify for the frame.
Then the year 2012 came in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
In the following year Craig Parnham, an English, trainer of the National Team, began to turn things to better.
"A cultural change, mental change and physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the work pensum in London that we have now.
We've been able to shake the ribbon completely.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the torque in the first half of the game with a relapse from the close area.
India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tired and kept the level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and jumped the ball into the gate to provide a 2-0 lead to the American women.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the United States gatekeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolin
Wherever you are, however late it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steadily and inevitably, a smooth gap between competition and pursuits.
It is as if the Olympic Facle itself was a burning stab that is reached by the arm brush protector to the swimmer to the tournament to triathlete.
You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is the first time with the Olympic Games and is a female swarm with graves, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he was a swimmer, turner or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights around gold in the Olympic Trampolin Tower.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.
Further from the center, partly in the shadow, are the sports types that are not generally recognised: air gun shooting, bow shooting, bathminton, Taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swims and may rule it for a long time.
But if I would be modest to make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.
Although trampolin jumping has been an olympical event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been seen in the past 16 years so clear that many of the ones I had asked did not know that it was at all an Olympia sport.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to race, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and had a athlete until 2012, which has made it up to the end round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampolin jumping has a certain outer crown, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthly enthusiastic.
It has a humoristic potential - the cartoonous cittering of its never-willing crawl - but also the grass of tournament and diving, the two sports types that unite it essentially.
The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "Sprungbrett".
Strong victory jumps on a gigantic trampoline, shoots up to 30 feet into the air and needs a number of falling movements (three, hives and saltos), before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to official Olympia programme according to implementation, difficulty and "air time".
Two-and-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will come against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight out.
In their pursuit of gold, medal hopes must continue, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goal, sometimes down and up, up and down on the playground.
They are pursuing not only the target line or the starting wall, but also another hobby target in the television transmission: the world or the Olympic Record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even touch a spectator to tear.
But it is also what I feel even when I look at these games as a bit tired.
The trampoline offers an atempause of it.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is upstairs.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she shatters, seemingly hard as a astronaut, goes up, then down, then hardly back up.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wools in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.
The qualification and end rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time, and the men on Saturday, also at 13.00 p.m.
NBC will radiate the end rounds as part of a afternoon block in both days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympia-Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, which is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If the consciousness increase can only be achieved by the admission and objectification of male athletes - as the male US tourners recently suggested in The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan community to ring to air.
"One Generation Protested" in Ethiopia, Long an Associate of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrants demanding political changes in Ethiopia were confronted with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that during the collapse with the police, ten protesters were killed in gun change.
Is Ethiopia just breaking together?
In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid alliance of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
However, in recent months, protests against the government shaken the country and expanded in more and more areas.
Last week thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reply was uncomfortable.
Witnesses suggested that policemen shot and killed unarmed demonstrators at eight.
In the course of videos about the protests that are probably from the last or early of this year, security men show how to strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The Head of the UN Human Rights Office now calls for an in-depth examination.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country of Africa, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable rate.
His infrastructure has significantly improved - there is a new pendler train in the capital of Addis Ababa.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was everything other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued to point out the government's opposition was restricted in the country, while dissidents were effectively suspended.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the vast parts of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and do not have any other options to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is protesting.
One generation protests.
There are many complaints that cover everything from the ground use to the casting grip with regard to the power of the prevailing coalition.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of opposition and now controls 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time the tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a struggle around this clever, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics fear that separatists such as the Oromo Relief Front or the National Relief Front of the Ogaden, which have been more or less confronted in recent years, could exploit the turbulences and be armed again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode now after years of cracking under the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones became increasingly frequent and improved Internet services.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they stay.
Several young Ethiopians indicated that they were gathering to protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnics in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eonen, the Amharas, who come from Ethopias mostly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and economics while exploiting the oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flatland areas.
But that's what's going on.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray who are about 6 percent of the population and dominant in military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the distress is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, an ex-rebellian leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death on an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was considered tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly decorated in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using the Special Officer to handle opponents and make them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively in transparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analytics say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more blood pouring.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a rebellion was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which seemed to have been consumed by the government and then stolen, according to the data of Analytics.
During the subsequent racials, many protesters were killed, even though there were less than in the past months and this period of distress passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised the leader of Ethiopia for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendler train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal disgunce of the Ethiopian government.
And she assumes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month protesters attacked businesses in Gondar, an amharic city, conducted by Tigray, and hatred against the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.
Analytics say that the protests bring the United States and other Western allies into a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for drone flights across the neighbouring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies to break together in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin digging."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS had been "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to break the last controversy that surrounds his campaign on Friday by indicating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been seriously meant by the "founders" of the Islamic state terrorist group.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidates whether he could be able to communicate clearly and understandably with the American public.
It also brings his competitors, who strive to protect him during an eventual phase, into the unique position to have to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the objection at a election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump rested with regard to the claim on Thursday and stated in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously.
When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism crazes down on Mr. Trump while he tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation because of falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
About Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already brought Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Naturally I meant the sarcastic".
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the language boundaries in politics and then to refrain as necessary.
"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clarify" depending on the reaction." Ruth Sherman said, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of determining the tone for the presidential elections, Mr Trump adopted an even more accelerated tone as his survey values have continued to decline.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership in the North Carolina state, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to have to apologize for his provound statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is increasingly focused on the attention of the last few months of his presidency campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal competitors into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him, regardless of how provokant his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York, and one of Trump's most prominent speakers, made great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate political comments," Mr. Giuliani said, so he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true, in this sense, that before Obama ISIS was a almost unknown small organization, he called them backbugers, completely wrong and so it happened because he took away the troops from Iraq.
Most Mainstream republics try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as a foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to control the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and invited them to resort to each of his words and to be preoccupied against him.
He insulted the "arm, shameful" television experts who tried to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the Democrats were ridiculating about Mr. Trump's excuse as just another evidence that he was inappropriate to the Presidential Office.
Once pushed over the price from the market, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a vicious café in Williamsburg, where only bar could be paid, which had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were pushed.
The shop Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Inhabitants betrayed it as the last loss in a city that refreshed itself.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I can't still believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel excluded and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York's a change, it's new invention.
A revived verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old café, the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working at verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outdoor office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, maintained a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the dining map, sandwiches are with speek and cheese and there are garnations such as caps and souted twins.
There are natural travel shots.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices for it.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he noticed a steady electricity from old family customers.
"Many old customers were also pushed out by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way on her own.
After closing the verb, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was in the verb of coffee and culture that I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea that is another new addition instead of her usual Iced Coffees.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-term and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there in front of the work and indefinitely ordered the same.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepared my Everything-Bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he switches his Everything-Bagel with spear, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he wasn't grieved that the soap business took the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verbs with the cold-growed coffee of the café as ingredient.
"I think we're still going to go to her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish residents Greenpoints also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the dining card into Polish and Rodriguez said that he plans to postpone it soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local saft room wants to fill and sell the cold-growed coffee into the bottle.
There is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building.
For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a family and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that the entry of the locale and ordering a new coffee felt like a return home.
"I had to smell that," he said.
The depressive food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office in March 1933, just after his rise to the President.
As a fine taster, President Roosevelt had a feasible for refined delicates of the Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de foie grass and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was slightly more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato furee and as desert a plume pudding.
"It was a act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes last book "Chop Suey" was about the Chinese kitchen in the United States, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a living house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Her latest cooperation, "A decent meal", which will appear in the Harper publishing on Tuesday, illustrates the history of the American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, narrowless imbis in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock crash in 1929.
Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, Truthahn ate with potato fur and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about the food during the era of the Great Depression.
"Real foods were very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was earthnut bread, liver cheese and bone bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many soil nuts that they serve as dinners.
Coe laughs.
"It must have been in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pastes were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways with which the country went out to be no longer the Slaffenland.
"It was a time when food became a central, excited topic for the Americans," Coe concluded why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Similarly, the new budget diet was excited: mysterious foods such as bread and box rolls were made to basic foods that reuse the cassing roll as a "wonderful kind, reuse of food," the brickman noted, as cooking could hide inappropriate ingredients under a cremous sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of the American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Odd mixtures were tested because calorie and nutrient satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy cuisine.
During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Tegelman prepared a court from this era, baked twins with earthnut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to lunch," says Coe.
Brickmann continues: "It was surreal."
Earth nuts butter and backed twins do not match each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or since, household managers - including Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Office of Home Economics - used the country's eating habits such.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budget politicians" and to meet the challenge of transforming pamps like creamy spaghetti with carots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of the historical delicious bites.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-Mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung, are tasteful.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse cuisine of his kitchen, he ate like the millions of men of the world to whom he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with gurkensauce," said Coe.
He ate in a nearly forgotten dining room and wearing a smoking.
He was wonderfully realistic stranger.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not invited him to statue an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a householder with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortless preparations."
Many of the species from the age of Great Depression to deal with food were rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs.
The power is on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When the couple wrote the book, the eating habits of brickman’s mother - for example, were not able to throw away food.
"She had a real fear of waste of food," said Coe.
Tegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe drew out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plume end-up that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
"It is called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a sent name.
There was no sausage, only plumes, some meal, sugar, water and cimt.
Everyone appeared a leaf in the thin, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe picked up a reputation three times.
Like a Can-Do Budgetier, he said to his wife, "Some hacked whales would help."
Killed at bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He set up his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others life.
Now the 30-year-old died even in a fass bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that, according to the picture newspaper, has saved nearly 60,000 people.
2900 Volunteers are putting their own lives at stake to move people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war area.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector showing him the world during a 11-hour salvation of a baby from a house's drums.
It made the Syrian a bright symbol in the grey of war.
As heroes, however, he never saw himself, said, "For me this is the real Jihad."
"If I die in saving life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself fell a victim attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four fascist bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorgas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breathing.
"We now remove the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don't play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had supposed to have met terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest wrestling animal is almost 400 years old
Rare looks.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in the winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board of the research ship of Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with about 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - up to today.
Greenland sharks only get back by 150 years.
The greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour, in an average, just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a Robbe at this maximum speed.
This slow lifestyle, however, seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the "Science" specialist magazine of a greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn," comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographical Research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for host animals.
Although the evolutionary biologist has long suspected that greenland sharks are being stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, especially in the Eismer, to live in the thinly occupied coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers do not know much about the lifestyle of the Greenland sharks.
They measured their timing rate when they equipped six animals with a sender in front of Spitzbergen.
However, these sharks do: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed the bone of a young ice bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patrouillate on the ground of the Eismer and look for cadaver that drought down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 greenland sharks, who from 2010 to 2013 took fishermen from Greenland or Spitzbergen as a cemetery from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeter measured.
To determine the age of the animals, they analysed the shark lens core with the carbon 14 method.
This center of the eyelinse is already developed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will not be renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon 14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons attempts swallowed larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
On the other hand, in the 220 centimeter length of the third smallest animal, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempts, so it was expected to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012.
All larger greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon 14 mixtures in their lens core, produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon 14-hour for a 493 centimeter long greenland shark showed 335 years of age, while the record shark with 502 centimeters may be 392 years old.
It was known that the Greenland Hai-Women will only grow up when they are longer than four meters.
The researchers of the length were now able to arrange an age.
As one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably on the threshold to mature and his age was determined at 156 years, greenland sharks are apparently at least one and a half centuries.
This should also be the world record for hostile animals at present.
That such methusalems live mainly in iron waters is not a coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, whose speck at the neck put an 120-year-old Harpunenspitze, was also captured before Alaska.
Due to low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on spare flames.
So they mature later - and older slower.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often getting particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal heats.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than in a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.
Construction ground in double pack
In the recent meeting, the Council of the municipalities has been considering topics around building.
With relief, the body received the communication by Mayor Robert Putz that "a final marketing of the newly designated residential areas can begin".
After the land, parcelation and closure questions were clarified and the applications for measuring were made, the sale of the property in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - Extension Section 1) is no longer in the way to interested persons.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential municipality Schönau are equally addressing young families and quiet seniors.
As it said, building volunteers can report immediately at the Council Hall, the Council is expected to consult at its September session on the provision of the parcels.
In order to be able to meet requests for the establishment of other businesses linked to the creation of jobs, the Council of the municipalities decided to amend the new area use plan in subdivisions only in the spring of this year.
Thus, in the suburban area, the trade area already shown there is expanded by two parcels towards State Road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
Accordingly, in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city at Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies transferred from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, director of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the IW.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.
To date, they have been allowed for the so-called EU passport in Britain.
It's just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced to move jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" calculates 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB) has the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Authority EIOPA and the Risk Council of the ESRB.
Although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The closeness to the Notenbank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW-Professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg has a large fund industry, it is, as with Dublin, that the infrastructure is worse.
Frankfurt would be much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
In addition, the city scores with easy-to-available commercial property.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine, the rent for first-class commercial immobilies was 50 percent higher than at the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offered a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's company consultancy, the city is located on place seven, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris at 37th place.
Although quality of life is a preferred issue: "With its already strong position as a financial position for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," says the IW.
However, despite the Brexit Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
The forces also say: In London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt there were 62500.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US official decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to reimbursement of the legal costs resulting from the Hepatitis C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was freed from a damage payment of $200 million for the violation of two patents by Merck, which were related to the Blockbuster Medicals Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misconduct from Mercks, including myides and other unethical acts.
When the complaint was raised on Thursday, U.S. official judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has the right to grant the costs resulting in the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to compare with Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with hepatic disease.
The case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck claimed each other and claimed laboratory work, which was based on sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
The U.S. supported troops say that they have re-established complete control of Manbi by the Islamic State
The U.S. troops supported the full control of the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters in the city have left them, said one speaker of the group on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) come through after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters that have buried themselves within the city, the city is now.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held as hostages by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish communicated with the Manby Military Council of Reuters.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are just doing cleansing," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax declaration for 2015 on Friday, which provided an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband.
In 2015, Clinton’s USD spent 1 million for wealthy purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former president Bill Clinton generated almost $5.3 million in Redehonorars; the former Foreign Minister announced a revenue of USD 3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vice-Presidentship, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton will publish his tax statements in the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency," announced Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a sharp contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawals in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax statements.
It is common for US Presidential candidates to publish their tax statements, although they are not obliged to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You are on the train," wrote Clinton's electoral competitor Ian Sams on Twitter, regarding the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax checks are not completed.
Trump's critics, including the republikan presidential candidate of the 2012 Middle Romney, have already made its refusal to raise issues regarding assets, its donations for well-equipped organisations, its business abilities and various other links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-range Republican Trump invites to publish its tax statement.
On Thursday she also spoke to the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and to publish his tax statements." she said to the quantity.
Politico reported that during the 1990s, Trump had paid no taxes or very few taxes, and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants who indicated that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a matter in the election struggle.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionary and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than $1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska asked Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerat has its seat here, to meet Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax statements.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the IRS and Trump had "angst" to the voters and not to the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax declaration backwards until 2007.
The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40,5%.
The 2015 Clinton's tax statement showed that these only amounted to USD 100 of their income as a remuneration, unlike the majority of all Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund, from which Clinton's dividends and revenues of USD 109,000 taxed.

Condoms with chilipuder, promote fireworks bodies Tanzanias elephant protection
Natural protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into people's residents - they throw condoms on them filled with chilipuder.
The method has proven effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea already years ago, has intensified its support along with US natural protection by training volunteers in villages in the northern Tanzanias to use a violent four-level method to protect their houses and harvests without harming animals.
Previously, many spears have used to defend themselves.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed the toolkit, we have been able to see a change in their attitude within these communities, with much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said the manager of Honeyguard Damian Bell in a communication.
The first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a fackle and the blowing into a horn.
If he is not scared, a so-called "Chiliwolke" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom whose end is turned to the tone.
When it is incinerated, the condom is placed with a knall and sprays fine dust of chilipuder into the air.
A pocket is usually already out to hunt the elephants.
One last option represents a warrior who shoots a golden firework and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council decides unanimously: No Kioskneubau at St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually, the St. Goarer is accepting investment projects by coasters - but just the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the request for a reconstruction of a sales skios at Rheinufer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony in the construction was now unanimously rejected by the City Council.
"We in principle welcome new business operators, but at this location in exponated location at the Rheinufer this Kiosk does not fit," Michael Hubrath explained for the CDU Group.
Jewish director breaks Berliner Hotel because Israeli prevalence was removed after "Arabic" request - RT News
A French director of Jewish roots was defeated by a media rebellion after he had told that Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed an Israeli predestination, since Arab guests said that it had "required".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" released his trouble at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country selection list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible for Israel to be eliminated and deleted in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany?
wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via a private call center.
The director turned to the hotel reception after a statement.
The answer he received there, "choking him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "consistent decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason that was behind it caused even more wrath in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the choice be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handler called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were disappointed and shocked by this event.
That's really awful.
The fact that this has occurred in just this hotel chain in Germany is even even a greater shame.
No explanation is required.
We expect the hotel to draw "the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet, where people called the whole scandal.
Some subscribed to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "rejected" the supposed invitations of Arab guests.
"Shame you," said in another contribution, which pointed out that the hotel, which is located at the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly rejected all the accusations and called the incident a "appropriate" and "apologized" with Lansmann, reports The Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction," Israel did not enter the Quick Election List," quoted the Süddeutsche Zeitung a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country election has now been added.
Police uses tear gas & rubber shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students joined the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber shots against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to dismantle the students, resulting in the use of rubber shots and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their distress over the plans.
According to the suggestions of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, some less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the participants were seen to spray Graffitits against the preliminary president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in mass to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been withdrawn from the office by a Senate voting for her appointment.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran increased by 70.9 per cent in the year.
Since international sanctions have been repealed against Iran, Russian companies have grown strongly in businesses in the country, the ambassador announced.
Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran, while new companies are willing to access the market.
Of course, further trade development is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports increased by 91.5 per cent in Iran and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade was achieved by delivery of machines, land vehicles and weapons," said the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative issued about 35,000 visa, primarily travel visa, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries, as regards the number of tourists in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, "he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something from which the Ambassador hopes that it will change.
"I personally can recommend the visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition," he said.
Witnesses searched: Drinking market in forest breeze
On Thursday night, a robbery has been performed on the drinking market of Rewe XXL on the forestbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the preservation of a gun, three dark-dressed persons who had mumpled their faces demanded from the personnel of the drinking market the output of cash and then fled to foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW-golf.
How much money has been spent, the police don't share.
The offenders should have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters, i.e. relatively small.
The drinking market is directly accessible from the Rewe market's parking deck and is poorly interconnected.
After the attack, the killers must be run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg, and from the castle parking space located opposite the parking house entrance with the silver-coloured car, perhaps towards B 256 (lead ring).
Those who have made observations in connection with the robbery are urgently to report to the police at the time of the day (at 19.45 p.m.)
Nagold: game and fun at summer free time
Eight nice and happy days the children and youths spent the social pedagogical group/social group work of the Nagold Children’s Protection Association with their maintainers on their summer leisure in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located recreational home of Hardtwaldle, the life-hearted group was acquainted during the first week of school holidays.
Several full day trips were on the program.
First of all, it went to boards with the visit to the Streichelzoo.
Secondly, after mole bronze, where there was a special child guide in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celten Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Celts.
During the hot days, the group at the deep sea enjoyed mills, which invited to jump, swim and planks.
Culinary children and maintainers were convened with their own prepared body foods such as the acids Latzel, the lake bronzer Pfännle, Isselhauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewelry was created from pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mole game.
Further peaks of leisure were the fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings at the fire and the final "Bound evening".
On the day of the trip, the sun laughed, and the children and youths returned happyly home.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims for the fun of mercy
The ministers from the Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrim migration from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were handled.
In order to overcome the time until the next Roma Wall Tour of all ministers for two years, the superior ministerial round of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrim migration.
Several wall travel goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishops City of Freiburg, where this year, at the Sacred Year of Barmness, with the furniture of mercy at the Freiburger Münster, was offered a special pilgrim goal.
16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Holy Rooms made themselves on the way.
In the evening before, the Pfarrer Storost sent out the pilgrims at a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave them the pilgrim seed.
From Horb out, the path was driven to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster Our dear wife stands and thus the Pilgrims path was reached by the Münster.
The individual day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures in the morning and evening.
But also on the way, the minis made on field crosses, chapels or churches again and again rust to sing together a song of a specially composed pilgrim song.
The local parishes were available for the nights each.
At the stage goals, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasteful and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, Furtwangen went to Güternbach.
The day afterwards, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most challenging distance, had to go down about 500 meters and then climb again.
The deserved reward was a common guilt at the bathing vineyard in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth Pilgrim day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the end stage to Freiburg.
Visibly enlightened and happy the minis met in the afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and passed through the pleasant places of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the Pilgrim goal were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service of God, the pilgrims were able to visit the Sacristai and the High Altar.
The next day was time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon, it went back to Horb by train.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were characterised.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when British Gold rings for bicycle sports
Scotlands Callum Skinner last evening in the men's team print in Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his landsman Sir Chris Hoy had owned. The boy pound proudly made the legend when he stormed home to find a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympic Medals.
They repeated the trick after they received only a modest sixth place in March at the London Railway World Championships despite the withdrawal of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the shot that has now evolved.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic Record in the Qualification Rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealands won in the first round.
And the British Trio won the duell with gold.
He was shortly back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A strategy change made a large part of the transformation, where Hindes went in a higher gang to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked out of his position as a BBC expert and fell up Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they rose to the podest.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a shiny comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We set up an Olympic record at the end round and conquered the World Championship.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph of 2012 on the Kennys and Hoys side, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the train.
He withdrawn this statement later and there was no objection of England's rivals.
In such a surprising victory there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribunal like London."
We've met as a team in the last three months.
We got away so badly from so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympiade.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successive five days in Velodrom.
With the form Kennys, it is possible that he repeats Hoys victory from three Olympic Gold Medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, which was also born on March 23 (a apparently sacred date for British sports; that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an exploit of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That would be the same of Hoy.
Kenny will then take part in the Sprint, which will start today and go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I enjoy this only for the moment."
The team event is always the best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be slain as a rider."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the target in 3:51,942.
The World Record, which won Gold in London in 2012, was 3:51.659.
The first and final round (2.2.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be safely focused.
He had struggled with officers before the qualification yesterday when functioners called him to measure his body size.
In the corresponding women competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in World Recording Time in 4:13.260.
The GB team is relying on its strong railway wheel team to dominate the mean period of the Olympic Games and get a lot of medal.
After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were dropped.
Dramas played in the background, so the retirement of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobing propositions as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when one looks at the first evening of competition in Velodrom, it looks quite like the legendary repetition of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of the melting of Portland due to the suspension of the energy contract
The future of the aluminum smelting of Portland in Victoria - and hundreds of jobs of workers - is at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and will thus renounce all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A subsidy fixed for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered when closing.
In addition, it could result in domino effects, as the melting series consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity production of Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerie, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, who delivers the large aluminium smeltery with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it is assumed that three other owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is located in the majority of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process," the company informed.
AGL continued that the Treaties were so-called "security operations" which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice deadline so that they will end in 2017.
"The AGL therefore assumes that in the financial year 17 the contracts will contribute to the revenue," said the electricity supplier.
All potential effects on revenues on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL announced that it had already described the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion of $187 million in "awaiting a notice".
Alcoa said that the decision to book out the contracts, to operate the ability of Alcoas, or to ensure the power supply to the meltery does not affect.
The U.S. company said that in 2010 a 20-year contract concluded with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still a declaration of why it was withdrawn from the Treaty.
Analytics warn the poor economic conditions of the industry against the possible closure of the portland smeltery in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to the statements of the Analytics early in the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts and tomago about 900 megawatts of electricity each year.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [Strom market].
And it would not be good for us as a powermaker," he said.
More than just one Cardashian Reality TV Star, Kendall is on the cover of the Vogue September edition
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the desired September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the trademark messenger of Estee Lauder who ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this covers brought me to cry," Kendall wrote.
The covers' decollection followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Cardashians similar?), written reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problems Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turning: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clever act nearly every birthday sepisode of a child's broadcasting (Seacrest made the sentence, "You thought we forgot about you?" with the honesty of a technician on a poster at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Cardashians has certainly started.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to have hit her as to the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were looking for it in April 2014), but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a liga for herself.
The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.
With a range that is more similar to a video band than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the forest 615 pages advertising).
The distinguishing of his coverstar is expected to be so desperate that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine still sent through before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, clearly more "preciousnesses, models" than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar prizemaker and Dior brand messenger Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "doorbreak model" of her generation - falls among the former category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or to reality stars or youths of today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (also if all of them applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.
With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a little excited.
In June, the only Victoria's secret model, Stephanie Seymour Jenner, and her colleague Gigi Hadid, criticized her and called her "the pieces of the moment."
These feelings cooked up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.
But it seems to be the point of circumcising the misfortune.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Vogue's September edition.
It is a super model in the most true sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertisements for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all her sisters sell pictures of yourself on their respective Paywall apps.
She sold pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure time, she's in reality TV. Probably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Community Rights Centres dismiss 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the most needed in the country are rejected by the communal rights centres each year, while the industry is dealing with the impact of further reductions on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, helpful workers, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unfair delogues and similar things - are rejected for free legal advice and legal assistance in their application.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively exhausted, are prepared for further reductions.
From June next year, it is planned that these legal centres will lose 30 percent of their federal funds.
The Director of the Common Rights Centres of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Rights Centres showed that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would be worse without a suspension of the decision of the Federal Government.
"Queenslands municipal rights centres are chronicly underfinanced, which means that thousands of people are rejected from important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with inconsistent and oppressive debts, families that go through separation, workers who have been unjustly released - all these people have legal problems and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need.
The Federal Government will reduce the funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more helped people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Advocate General and Federal Justice Minister, as well as Senators of Queensland George Brandis, to withdraw these reductions immediately, so that people can receive the help they need in legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to increase legal aid funds to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the communal rights centres and their customers' communities and that the government invests Palaszczuk in this important work.
Donald Trump election campaign charged after employees claimed to have moved weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of inactivity, since she was informed that her campaign leader had directed a gun to a staff in February, while they were on the way in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in a complainant written by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state, which was submitted on Wednesday at the National Court of Charlotte.
Bordini announced that he had waited for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that "it wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drove a gun, put his right finger on the departure, and hit the run in Vincent's kneehole," said Bordini in his charge.
After complaining at the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four more people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the charge.
"Waffen don't have to be fired to cause damage," said Bordini.
The charge comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a rebellion when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Change People" - gun owners and gun friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was to be elected and judged.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media had ripped his words out of the context and that he wouldn't strike to violence.
Bordini's complaint demands damage from the campaign for violation of care and Philip's physical injuries and lasting emotional damage.
Trumps press speaker Hope Hicks was not available for an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news sender in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.
On calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, was not responded.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Land-Walen survey: Loss SPD and CDU
In the upcoming elections in the Bundesländer Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) significant losses for government parties SPD and CDU.
This showed representative surveys by the INSA opinion research institute for the "Image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could barely continue to rule, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.
However, in both federal countries, the SPD would be the strongest party and thereby have good opportunities to continue to set the Head of Government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party was only shortly before the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previous 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country day.
In spite of light losses, the green ones relapse with 6 percent (previous 8.7 percent) into the heavy country day.
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 per cent on the country day.
In the Berlin parliamentary election, the SPD was estimated to be only 23 percent (val 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU was only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but in front of the left with 15 percent (formerly 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House.
By 5 percent, the FDP could hope that the pirates would miss the withdrawal in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The followers today dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a decay.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was quite clever.
The built-in memory was at first eight megabytes, which would be sufficient for about two selfies with high resolution today.
A iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 communicator" came to the shops just 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they come somehow from the stone time of the Internet age.
However, 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as "Buro in the West Taschen format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.
Even access to web sites was possible via HTML browser, although painfully slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened like a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black-white screen found.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
In August 1996, no one could know that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything has been different since then.
The wise phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The phone parts of the Finns experienced an unprecedented decay, were finally sold to Microsoft and developed.
Today, the market dominates suppliers, who came all much later than Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is for many people today.
In 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold, on Samsung and Apple alone 555 million pieces.
The worldwide sales with the devices are around EUR 400 billion.
These are the good-run businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.
In the meantime, a whole industry has developed around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough of the mass market arrived at the beginning of 2007, then Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac world.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicationer, easy to use everything by touch screen.
The victory of Apple started, still today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the surveillance.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The story now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a naturality 20 years after its invention.
Every German now looks at his phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away once," just said Janina Kugel, responsible for staff in the Siemens board.
Permanent accessibility is now regarded as curse and blessing at the same time.
England must guide the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity throughout the country, not only in our local municipalities and throughout London.
For me, this represented the greatest attraction of Heathrows, as was then in London in 2012, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiad brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we will only create 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the enlargement of Heathrows is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blame ourselves on the world scene.
The Zweifler had injustice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he has asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals a infrastructure project.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in scientific growth, and to leave a power of skills and employment both to the airport and to the whole GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented an expensive £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, selected by T5 - the five years followed to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequent runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third step, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to direct this Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow and ensure our future trade and create a power of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and Mouse Game" about adblocking
For companies earning money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to deal with adblocking, a "cat and mouse game" is similar.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising again in the social network.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding of its advertisements in order to make it difficult to detect what part of the page advertising is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to deal with the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her-kamp between the advertising Open Source Community and the surroundings has already been in progress since the invention of adblockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest company for social media has been engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying adblockers have become for the industry.
According to a recent study by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use adblockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users who access Facebook via their mobile end-apparatus, craftsmanship represents 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company has looked at adblockers on desktop PCs, as mobile adblockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and instagram, a speaker announced.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large proportion of revenues so that Facebook finds the investment of such a step worthwhile.
On Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update his "display preference tool" to have more control over targeted advertising to the people.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be anxious for new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising.
"For users this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," said a speaker of Facebook in an e-mail release.
Adblockers are a stupid means, so we have concentrated on developers tools like Ad Preferences to put more control into the hands of people.
A woman who is likely to be suicide on Swiss motorway
The victim was on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police call witnesses after a woman was overrun on a motorway in the early morning hours of Thursday in a likely suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the Canton Waadt shortly after midnight.
In the dark "in a act of despair" a woman put himself on the street and was hit by several cars," said the police in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman aged 49 who was overrun by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who invited them and every witness of the event to report.
Gilles Hofstetter announced to Le Tribune de Geneve a "logical" step in such a situation.
However, it remains waiting for one of the drivers to be displayed.
Was a collapse avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not taken into account.
In each of the two cases - where a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a walker runs on the motorway in the middle of the night, as it was said in the newspaper.
Last year, a policeman was released from the unfair killing, after she had overrun and killed a man who was on the A1 in August 2014 one night near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and has become conscious on the street, the court heard.
The court noted that the policeman -- who had answered an emergency call - went in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," said the judge.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabitable
The Venus was probably once inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have demonstrated earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-proof atmosphere.
Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow turning of the Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and still slowly turned on.
The model also highlighted the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to reside and protect from rapid dilution.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turning of the Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a rainscreen to protect the surface from a large part of the sun heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus, similar to evolution, which was previously suspected by planet researchers.
Although she was probably once inhabitable, the Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over a period of billions of years.
Their oceans were diluted and their water damp was burned away from ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy retires as a trainer of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy returned on Thursday as a trainer and vice-president of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche and introduced a little co-decision in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my responsibilities as chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and certainty," said the 50-year-old Roy in an opinion.
In the course of the summer, I have thought for a long time and a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth, that it needs and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly agreed to that of the organization.
He must also have a right to co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not fulfilled at the moment.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick has informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best trainer of the League during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14.
He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was hit in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the post season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference with five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Workers resume conversations, suspend strikes
Working fights regarding the remuneration for North Sea oil workers are being suspended, while all parties put themselves on the table for a new round of discussions, said negotiators.
Stricts against the Oil Field Service Provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," says a joint statement.
We will hold a few whole day meetings in the next weeks, which will begin early next year to re-establish the problems.
The trade unions said that their last strike, the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
This year Wood Group reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The rate reduction of the company follows a 10-percent decrease for unsean contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the necessary space to get through the market decline.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business as a result of its mechanism of association with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower ro-guide travel, a economic situation which was strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The schottic Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met early this week with workers to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.2 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the stars of the Pleyades
The latest mission with the Kepler Spacetelescope has helped astronomers collect the fullest catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the Plejades' stars.
The new data help the astronomers understand why stars in the stars are rotating to different rates and in the context of the rotation periods with planetary development.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The stars of the Plejaden are 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this starhop, which developed about 125 million years ago, now reach adult age.
They're turning the fastest now.
To the top rotation rates, these mature stars explode large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognized star spot -- like sunlaces --.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars rotating slow piroutes than smaller.
"In the "Ballet" of the Plejaden we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the stars of the Plejades are so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare rigorous qualitys such as rotation rates.
"The stars of the Plejaden offer an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, in fact, hang up their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the Rotation Rates of Plejades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star occurs
The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US Baseball Star in best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional retirement announcement, the 41-year-old professional will last time wear the Tricott of his New York Yankees on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," explained the 14-time all-star game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
Rodriguez was elected three times as the most valuable player of the League, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
Since 2007, his signature under a ten-year contract gave him 27 million dollars per year.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees created some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Family members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the glory hall of the baseball.
Because Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was so successful in the field, his appearance is controversial outside of the place.
Already in 2009, the Superstar at the "ESPN" admitted that he had taken forbidden steroids from 2001 to 2003.
In August 2013, he was locked for 211 parties as a result of a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.
Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspicion of having been given benefits for years through an anti-age clinic in South Florida.
After a dispute, the block was reduced to 162 meetings.
"The Liga could even have done me a favor for 2014, because I played 20 years without breaking," said Rodriguez then.
Also his departure days are not noiseless.
While many Baseball Leagues again received the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job doesn't include a divorce tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," Yankees Coach Joe Girardi ate.
Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz, was given a reputation to the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, sympathy of the fans by the Yankee Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the followers sang at the 4:9 downside against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Found: Due to a positive doping test, Adrian targetinski Weight Heavy must not start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A catched atletine had almost won a medal.
Before the seventh fighting day, the first official doping cases have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmerin Chen Xinyi, 3000 metres barrier runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish Weight Heavy Adrian targetinski was tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the critically occupied light athletics competitions, these news are untimely.
In Chen, the diuretics hydrochlorothiazide had been demonstrated in the last Sunday, which is used as a masking tool for doping substances.
The International Sports Court of Justice CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had placed the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday Chen should have participated in the precursors over 50 m freestyle.
Chen requested the opening of the B-test and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The National Association takes the matter "very serious and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigations", Xinhua quoted from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court of Justice and will accept the judgment".
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Even in the night of Rio, the message of the positive sample at Danekowa passed through, the 33-year-old went to the Offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "a incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV sender BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," explained the light atlete.
According to the report, the prohibited substance should be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa was temporarily suspended, according to BNT, the B-test should also have been positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately announced criticism at the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgaria are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
Thus, for example, all the weight-heavers from the chronic doping-bed nation must not participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympian in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively three days earlier, like his brother Tomasz, on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.
Both object to the intake, but both may not start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the case Danekowa is a further severe hit for the restoration of the entire sport.
The World Association IAAF had forbidden the complete Russian team to an exception because of systematic dopings, also the laurage Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.
In the swimming sports, the former crimes in China had also made a serious conflict between the athletes.
So the French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympian Sun Yang harsh.
"Sun Yang pinched lila."
"If I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," said Lacourt in the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a conflict with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for Doping-Betlers," said he.
Sun had been tested positively in 2014 for the Chinese masterships on the Stimulan trimetazidin, but only one three-month blocker had to sit down.
Data clown: So perfide pressing hackers their ransom money
Depressive malware programmers are currently attacking targeted companies - and are successful.
According to a current survey by the Malware Rescue Specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past 12 months were at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with erpressor software.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already the target of ransomware compression.
40 percent of the victims were willing to pay the ransom required by the offenders to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The offenders specialize their erpresser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes in view of attacks in company networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially repressive ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently watching an alarming fast evolution of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "Welt".
In 2008 most malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the offenders discovered pressure software for themselves.
First, private users were the goal, but the change to business attacks took place terrifyingly quickly in the past months.
Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it is looking for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals duly.
The software then presents the demands of the repressors.
To get the end encryption code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Crypto Currency Bitcoin -.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is silent.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware is hit.
22 percent of the German companies concerned reported sales losses by ransomware, 13 percent even had to break business completely, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be instantly threatened by the loss of medical acts.
"We always say to the victims, don't pay, you only support the problem," explains Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90 percent of the companies who pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the offenders in the event of stopping in operation.
The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, F-Secure's security researchers have examined the user surfaces and contact with the pressors and come to the result: The offenders are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain their victims by chat how to pay by bitcoin, correct freely accessible support sites or decrypt for free example files.
And if privates are released from a few hundred euros after payments, businesses have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively riskless profits of Ransomware pressure, the hackers become more and more professional and share the work, Chester Wisniewski Security Expert of the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "One individual person can write a ransomware about within a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their damage software in the form of a software building box to the actual depressors.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"In the range of delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and fireing can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The pressors then search for further hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in in one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
The payment is made per infected computer.
"Then, the criminals usually order spammers with the spread," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known in many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of company IT responsible in the Malwarebytes survey trust in being able to rescue Ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the offenders are already following new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer sufficient threat to successful experience, the offenders are threatening instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the potential for damage is much higher depending on the type of data than before.
In the future, the offenders could also take completely new goals on the Internet of things to the grain.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of the winter, the free switching of such a blocked heating could be worth some victims a ransom.
If the offenders then block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the diversity of a minivan.
Sounds quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V works rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in both the first row and the fund, it does not work closely at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasantly, only the cockpit's top is dropping somewhat.
Multilateraler than comparable vehicles are the HR-V at the vacuum.
There is not only a cabinet room of 453 l in high and 1026 l in folded back leasing, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magic than it sounds: the seats of the backbank can be folded up like cinema belts and thereby offer dust room that is from the ground to the ceiling 1,24 m high.
The cabinet room can be loaded well, but the charging height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the rotation of up to 300 Nm in wide rotation ranges very powerful.
However, he is supposed to do his work a little slower.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is delightful.
There is another engineering: a 1.5-l benzine with 96 kW/130 PS.
A all-rad drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not open any wishes in the tested top version "Executive".
The City Notbrems Assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the trace resistant.
The collisions warner sometimes irritates because when ranking many obstacles as "continuing objects".
The remote light assistant works very reliable.
And the intelligent speed controller responds to the transport mark identification and, if necessary, threatens the speed.
However, full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI books are under the arm leather and are therefore something to reach.
The around 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you don't want to invest so much, the petroleum receives from EUR 20000, the diesel from EUR 23000.
The engines meet the Euro-6 exhaust standard.
With the HR V, Honda offers a diverse and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Destroy on air gas bridge
A airline is not responsible for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
The Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued that a liability could only be considered in case of dangers typical of air traffic (Act: 18 U 124/14).
The complainant broke a knee disc at the crash.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, according to the Court of Justice.
The airline didn't have to pay the man any damage.
Disease: When the organiser pays
Disadvantaged vacations only get money back after their trip if the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel.
But that is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, on the second day of their Turkish leave, a family was severely ill of diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost all the holiday in the room.
Their illness led the vacationists to a defective clerical condition that claimed to have contaminated the seawater.
The family believed that the journey had been inappropriate - and complained against the organizer.
In front of the court, the applicants had no success.
Though the clergy was actually defective.
However, the organiser had only received it shortly before the complainant went away.
He had to assume that the seawater was okay until then.
So he did not infringe his information obligations, so the judgment.
No contaminations were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - perhaps by interference - belongs to the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizère said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state had to react wisely and firmly at the same time to terrorist hazards.
Surely, our country will not answer the violence of the deceivers with hatred and division.
This triumph will not be awarded to the terrorists.
If criminals have to leave the country faster, this increases security and also strengthens the consent of the people for refugee policies.
De Maizère intends to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the 2017 Federal Day election.
He also announced a further personal strengthening of security forces, "in the medium four-digit range over several years".
Sympathy inheritance for terrorism has to be punished again.
Video surveillance is intended to improve, arms law is novelled so that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is difficulty.
The last much discussed obligation for doctors is to be maintained according to the words of de Maizière.
However, in dialogue with the physician, he wants to look for solutions to reduce the danger of the citizens, for example, with regard to psychological incidents.
In order to prevent radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers need to be better prepared for handling traumatized people.
In order to persecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet) de Maizère plans the use of covered mediators.
SPD-Chef Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase safety."
It is important that the Minister of Interior has clearly spoken against actionism.
"This was an earfighter for the screwmakers in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a Burka ban and abolition of double nationality.
A general ban on full settlement it considers to be a problem of constitutional law.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I'm rejecting Burka's carrying.
You can talk about rules such as road traffic or witnesses before court.
Greenen-Chefin Simone Peter suggested to the Minister that he wanted to simulate action and action with always new anti-terror packages.
Left-Parteichef Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotte Proverbs and a sharpening of residence rights no longer bring security to people in this country."
Better traffic flow on the motorway provider
It stands regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture of November.
However, this is to change: the right-to-right trail is to be extended.
This is a good message for all car drivers who are in the career on the surrounding street every evening when they drive over the car trailer (A 43).
The Landbetrieb Straßenbau extends the right pad by 700 meters on the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between the Hammer Street and the departure Weseler Straße.
Car drivers can then fold right from the Hammer Street.
The great advantage: traffic is more early, which improves the overall flow on the high-performance section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU Group in the district representing Münster-West.
The motorway congestion on the transporter is especially nervous for the drivers between 17 and 19 o'clock.
Working days, the backstay reaches the bridge over the Albersloher Road and sometimes beyond.
Reason is the Nadelöhr on the B 51 shortly before the departure Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is only one-wayed through the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt well one-third of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required sustainability to include, in particular, heavy load traffic.
The duration of this cross-pass and the working day-to-day dust, the competent country operation cannot say.
However, years are expected: because the bridge has a official remaining period up to 2034.
For the renewal of the legal basis, the national company has deliberately chosen the weaker time in the school holidays because there is a expectation of disabilities.
Transport is carried over on Tuesday and Wednesday on the construction site.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theatre "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Classe International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has visited an idea of the price-crowned piece "The Invisible House" of the Boy Theatre of Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Travel" initiated by the Nima Association, 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the inclusion in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself for the cultural integration of young people with the background of migration and refugees, offers the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the framework of this project.
Most of the youths of the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016, among other things, from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria and speak little German.
Thanks to the choreography, the scenic images and video animations, they had been able to follow the course of action, according to the press release of the boy Theatre Münster.
The Nima's Association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Language, and the Young Theatre will cooperate in the coming playtime in the framework of a music theatre project.
From October to December, youths with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will be given the opportunity to visit professionally directed courses in the fields of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre games and theatral speech are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
In view of the increase in refugees, the association counts with many classes who want to participate.
Rain instead of stars: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the snaps in the southwest of Germany a strike through the bill in the evening to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night had been badly suited for watching the sky spectacle because of clouds and rains, the president of the Starwart Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night to Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see many stars in the sky.
The stars are Perseeds, which are one of the fastest star snaps of 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their names because they seem to come from the star picture of Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you grow around forever, you lie awake for hours, and the morning is far before the woke ring no longer to think of sleep.
That's all but relaxing.
Of course, you have such problems in good society: According to Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or lastingly as unrecoverable.
How are sleep problems or sleep disorders expressed?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes to them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, director of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medical.
What you can understand below is the insomnia, i.e. an insomnia and sleep disorder.
Especially sleeping, many people feel inadequate or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, director of the German House Doctors Association with practice in the Dutch Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Thereafter organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines can be found.
The sleep disorder is uncommonly the expression of another disease.
"Very early awakening is mostly common in a depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors require each other.
For example, if you have a cable incident, you may lie bad, wake up every two to three hours and may begin to grieve about everyday problems and concerns, weed gives an example.
This leads to excitement, and sleep is no longer possible.
From when to the doctor with sleep disorders?
If you are not sleeping well in at least three nights per week for a period of one month, you should go to your doctor.
The disorder can look quite different: you are cut off, tired, unslaped, have difficulty with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, have mood fluctuations or physical disorders such as stomach or headaches.
To reduce sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
As treatment options, such as behavioural changes, cognitive behaviour therapy, or medicines - classic sleep tablets - only in exceptional cases and not more than two weeks - are in question.
In Germany there are hardly sophisticated sleep doctors, emphasized by Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of Charité University Medicin Berlin.
Therefore, when sleeping problems occur, you should first contact the household doctor, advises Weeß.
It can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleeping lab, and what's going on?
For a study in the sleeping laboratory, doctors, for example, advise in snails with atemaous sets, in sick day tiredness, in sleep migrants, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains Fietze.
You don't really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normal.
"Don't sleep for lunch," says Fietze.
After cableing, you go to bed at your normal time.
Besides the electrodes on the body you wear a nose glass, a chest belt and a feeler on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the deck draws the sleeping one.
How can the affected cope with the problems?
There are quite a lot of screws that can be used for better sleep.
Weet is on: regular sleeping and upstairs, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not TV to sleep, alcohol avoiding and watching the clock at night - then you start expecting immediately, and that is not quite beneficial.
What the jungle camp has with missing medals in swimming
The former German Swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself by Facebook to disappoint the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had for the first time picked up gold for the shortway world championships in Doha and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has been protecting from his ex-team colleagues in criticism via Facebook.
"In a country where an Olympic Age receives 200,000€ premium and a jungle king of 150,000€ nobody should wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page at Friday.
The supporting system in swimming sports is bad, however, the doping controls are very good.
We cannot compete with countries that promote much and do not look so closely or even do it.
"I don't say that the controls should be set up here," he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler had to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
Likewise, you should keep it with countries.
"Who is unable to be controlled by independent controls of WADA/FINA for a certain time before WM/OS", the electoral Hamburger, who now operates an ice piece of ice.
Airport: Band of baggage thieves arrested
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
Citizens of the Düsseldorf police reached the arrest of two women and two men from 50 to 61 years of age on Thursday.
As a band, the suspects had committed several bags and luggage thieves.
By 9:30 p.m., civilian officials in Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band known to the police from past steel delicates.
The two women and two men have been dealing with several delicates since mid July of this year and have been conducted jointly, workingly and especially professionally.
The specialists of the Criminal Commission 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who were specially invited to do crimes to Germany.
In total, they had spent over 15 000 euros.
Old buildings, a few queen trees, in the meantime still a rest of headstones: The Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work like this at the first glance, but the police are one of the "safe places" of the city.
If you go along the road from east to west, you come to playgrounds, a freshly stretched children's garden and a biostorage.
At the facade of a grey house, someone sprayed "smart!"
On the other hand, a Lidl, which is to be cut off soon, will be built: a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be built by 2017.
However, articles on this "threatening district", as the competent property company Friedrichshain calls, are preferred with burning cars in recent weeks.
Reason is the house with number 94: First it was occupied, now the inhabitants have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms and are used for events.
Especially since the beginning of the year, Berlin's interior Henkel had repeatedly expressed himself for a hard approach by the police against the project, the area called "No-Go Zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the spaces on the ground floor, the caterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers on June 22, the police patrouillated official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from joining the house with number 94.
In the meantime, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown household owners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the room had been illegal, and one day later police and construction workers went off under the joy of sympathists and residents.
This summer afternoon the street works peaceful: parents go walk with children, people sit on the cemetery in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves for late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects, a primary school and children's gardens are located.
Left violence is not the main concern of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are mainly generated by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of increasing rent and genetisation.
It doesn't sound like a kiez who was mostly in favour of police protection against vandalizing links.
The grave that the Berlin Interior Senator and the police open between housekeepers and their neighbors does not appear to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working quarter, which has low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city today.
House crews and the living projects born thereafter have also long been part of Kiez: In 1990 many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Rigaer.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a regular street slaughter, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and, partly, are still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly magnetic for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world: with them, residents from DDR times and former housekeepers now share their Kiez.
This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 in new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognised on cast discs or freshly stretched façades that have been worn with color bags.
No other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason why not all neighbors consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body violation are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the crimes constitute damages, which tends to meet the new and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, it cannot be spoken of uncertainty.
With regard to violence, she is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they certainly have not been.
The famous burning cars also have no longer been available directly in the Riga.
For the studyed architectural, her street is not a criminal fuel point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than anywhere else".
Newbuilders are consciously moved to the Riga road - and remained.
Hence, it was so important for the residents to get back their road: from the police, the politics and the media, who in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district.
But in the eyes of residents such as new builders, the road is still taken away from them: through sightless new buildings in former building holes that push the old residents.
"That's ultimately property apartments that are not interesting for many here - people who are more people who are not so well-dealt," she says.
"Wald and destruction I can't approve."
But what if you don't listen to anyone?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for breeders who are anxious about color bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to Kiez.
You should be aware of that, just as someone who moves into a knee quarter there can complain badly about noise.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in matters of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogy supports the team of administration at Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group of refugee assistance, administration, authorities and others.
Regine customer from the work circle indicates that the honorary officials are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-leading wool milksau, which has a problem in particular.
Thus, some - less ridiculous than rather the number of desired tasks - had meant destiningly as the administration wanted to write out the office.
An administrative power was requested with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in social work, just an egg-leading wool milksau.
However, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deusschle.
Especially it is organisation, work with people on the spot and also behind the schools and networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50-percent stake for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regine Kunde that Annika Deusle supports honor- and chief actors.
There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers stand in the water road
It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the prosecutors who have been recognised.
The municipalities are responsible for access information.
They must place refugees in their own or hired living rooms.
The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
The responsibility is changing from the Council of Land to the municipality and the employment centre.
Problem: There are free items, but not every tenant wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for a while.
In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work until now, it is required to be private apartments, so Deuschle.
Thus, public apartments need to be adulted, as it says so beautiful.
So soon new containers are set up in the waterway.
But only with apartments it isn't done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a fixed stay, there are practices, training centres, school places, one-Euro jobs and helping activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the construction plant or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for community will lead to a positive external effect.
That's "no employment therapy".
But activity does not only mean work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deusle and customer.
People have to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are nice.
So there's also a jump in administration and honorary officials here.
It is essential that the refugees feel that they are desired and welcomed in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They must explain to the refugees that it is just going to take time and they can overcome the time, for example with language courses.
Anyone who develops the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be unnecessary, he will never integrate himself.
The clear majority was motivated.
However, there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "a lot where nothing goes with." The work of Deusle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.
That's all a "momother job".
A difficult question: Are the two after the latest events afraid of radicalisation, including in a small municipality such as Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some may call naive." A residual risk can and do not want to exclude it.
But the helpers are already sensible.
These incidents are also subject to refugees.
They would be afraid that the attackers would put them in charge.
"You want to show that they don't have anything to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and honorary officials in the area and in the region have to watch out for activities.
They always have the background that soon a new cast of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics are disgusting.
Actually, it's unfair to put her helpers in place.
"In Urbach we haven't yet arrived where we can go," says Annika Deusschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already uttered to integrate the people of the past.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they must be helped, both women agree.
The political situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Inbreaker with helicopter
The police helicopter flew from various areas for about an hour - unreasonably.
Two unknown men were violently entranced into a apartment in a multi-family house in the Lindenweg on Friday morning at 8.50 o'clock.
The inhabitant surprised the two and struck the accident into the escape.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 metres large, probably masked, wearing both bluejeans and black caps.
They fled towards the city.
The police used several strip crews as well as a police helicopter.
The capture left without success.
The unknowns may have fallen close to the apartment or when they escaped before they did.
Baden-Württemberg: Police detected by Rocker attack on Imbiss

In the case of home searches, evidence and raid poisons were guaranteed, the police informed on Friday.
About 20 masked men of a rocker-like grouping, according to police in July, had thrown bottles and stones against the windows of an imbis.
Then they should have attacked two guests and easily hurt one.
Then they fled.
At the Imbiss and the adjacent building, there was a damage of 10,000 euros.
According to the mediators, there is a struggle in Ulmer Rockermilieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
