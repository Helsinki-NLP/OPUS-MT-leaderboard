We'll talk about that soon.
This store has openly every day.
I wonder what country will censure Tatuba first.
I made some changes.
Tom couldn't decide immediately.
They're like day and night.

It looks like Mary's drunk again.
A man who doesn't spend time with his family can't be a real man.
I'll get to the point.

I speak Japanese, English and French.
I wasn't aware that you felt so bad.
I've been pretty busy.
We're both very older now.
I never trusted them.
I like that dress.
I hate to come too late.
No, you can't use my car!
I know you're busy.
I'll be alone.
What's it worth?
I'll make it happy.
Unfortunately, that's true.
We're dressing the Christmas granules.
What did you look at?
The victim was lying with the face down in the mattress.
You're getting a bitch of me.
They married, even though they barely spoke each other's language.
The toilet is behind the stairs.
I want a ice cream.
Good.
You're the one I love most.
Contact with the number you've chosen is not available.
Tom studged back.
Welcome!
It wasn't amazing.
Easy jail, easy past.
Have everyone found their mistakes?
Where's your uncle?
The house was quiet.
I made my feelings darken my judgment.
Tom took Mary's hand.
People are sitting on the grass.
I heard a South American camper was eaten by an anaconda.
She felt we were too different.
They look so happy.
The lake had frozen, so we went over the ice.
Why does Tom never visit us anymore?
It's actually a good point.
Who said I stole the money?
They were vulnerable.
When was this temple built?
Don't you care?
This paper does not absorb ink.
It hurts the knee when I bow on it.
None of this is real.
I lost everything I had.
We have to go once.
Tom sneaked down.
It's okay.
I'm responsible for his behavior.
Tom's scared.
I got a reading plate in the Christmas app.
She's playing hockey in the weekends.
You don't talk much.
The red paraply reminded her of her grandmother.
I remember the first time.
This is a very time-destructive task.
Tom took off his clothes and went into the shower.
The other kids call her Nasse.
That meant a lot to me.
I'm not good at dancing.
I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom teacher.
She's got too much work on herself.
She's crazy.
Give Tom a handle.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never agree.
It's uncertain whether the letter has ever appeared or not.
We haven't done anything.
You lost your pen.
You're gonna lie in bed all day, are you?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under tag thread.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?
Give this to Tom.
Tom knows it's true.
He cried.
Can I see Tom today?
Nobody wants it.
Who destroyed this?
How do you think I feel?
A Japanese garden usually has a dust.
I don't feel good at all.
Tom likes eating cold pizza for breakfast.
Tom's downstairs.
You should have seen her.
I need to buy freemarks.
Playing tennis is his hobby.
Tom made a good put.
Do you prefer a male or female doctor?
The door is locked.
Then try it.
It didn't really affect us.
Did Tom vote?
I'm going like a penguin.
Have I forgotten anything?
You're longer than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?
Her speech bored me.
I can't eat chocolate.
I think we should do as Mr Tom suggests, unless anyone else has a better proposal.
The ice is very thick.
Do you understand?
I can only speak for myself.
Tell me what the problem is.
Tom hit Mary.
You should have liked it.
I have a few more.
I'm using the computer.
Six were invited, the boy included.
Kate's cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There's no doubt about who's elected.
He was hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read Sagan about the ring trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.
She advocated equality.
What are you looking at?
They died young.
Stop talking to me.
Be greeted, gille brother.
Where is the Portuguese Embassy?
My friends didn't deceive me during the trial.
Tom shot me in my leg.
I was just ridiculous.
Stay down.
You weren't here then.
Here's Tom.
I don't like modern jazz.
Tell Tom what you want to do.
We need to talk to you about Tom.
What's wrong with her?
Dress fast.
I took the picture.
I said good morning.

I need an answer.
I hate my computer.
He lost control of the car in the basket.
I hope you'll find Tom.
Mary works in the city's public library.
We're different.
Come back in the cabinet.
She helped the old man over the way.
Nobody's too old to learn.
I'd do anything for love.
Two men with shit masks went into the bank.
This book belongs to the school library.
Nothing of it was real.
There must be a pattern.
It hurts to have to say this, but it's the truth.
Tom blew me.
Tom helps.
One morning he saw a sweet girl.
This tree is not even close to being the highest in the socks.
Let me take a look.
Tom wants our help.
Time's out, leave your bets.
My father's healthy.
We can save many lives.
If you don't have any money, you'll be fine without.
I'm afraid I'm going home.
Just say it.
Helen's words suddenly filled me with new power.
Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need something?
I want a couple of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should've already done it.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy took the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mygging beds.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cooling.
Does this remind you of someone?
I would like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He will fall for the temptation.
The twenty doesn't work.
I can explain that.
She acts like a child.
How does it look?
Mary thinks she has super powers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but at least you can accept that there are people who have other opinions than you?
Tom put the book down.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't think of seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I am paying for my Internet dependence.
I never thought it would be so difficult to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone for a long time.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't take myself down to town.
In any case, it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it down?
Tom blinked with the whole light.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone said they did.
Nobody here's called that.
It's time to go.
All three men laugh.
Come sit down.
It's gotta be good.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My motor soak is broken.
You think she's pretty, huh?
He lived a simple life.
This will take years.
I misspelled the word.
I don't like this book.
A ink fish has ten arms.
She didn't come before two.
I am.
It was very good.
Come talk to me.
He took care of the baby.
Leave me alone!
Never had I seen such a peaceful vision.
Tom's fast.
Of the Finnishs, about 4.9 per cent are Finnish Swedish, i.e. people with Swedish language.
Unfortunately, Tom left.
What is the difference between American and British English?
I'll read the book.
I did the wedding shower.
Use a shell pell, not an axe.
Could you write down the link to that site?
She attached a photo.
The walls of the old house weren't straight.
Where is she?
It feels really good.
Why do you like that?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver wrestled the wheel to the right.
I'm on the wind.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.
Did you win?
Everybody dreams.
Milk is made on wheat.
How did you get this?
Is that relevant?
You gave it to me.
I knew you'd make sense.
When I came home, I discovered the breakdown.
The cat has two ears.
Not really.
You don't even like chocolate.
She likes singing.
Christ is resurrected!
I need your opinions.
I've had a hard afternoon.
Will you wait for us at the station?
I can't see anybody.
The more you get to know her, the more you will like her.
Give Sami a kiss.
Are they in love with each other?
What's your favorite snack restaurant?
Tom won't stay.
I'll do it.
We need to find it.
