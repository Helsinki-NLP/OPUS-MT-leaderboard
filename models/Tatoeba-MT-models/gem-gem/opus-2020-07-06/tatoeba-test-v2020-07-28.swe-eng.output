I told Tom to take it easy.
I'm an old man now.
Tom teacher.
She's got too much work on herself.
She's crazy.
Give Tom a handle.
You wouldn't like Tom.
Does Tom know how you feel about him?
Tom wondered if what Mary said was true.
We'll never agree.
It's uncertain whether the letter has ever appeared or not.
We haven't done anything.
You lost your pen.
You're gonna lie in bed all day, are you?
Tom can't do that.
Tom crawled under tag thread.
I didn't even know her name.
Are you really going to do that?
Give this to Tom.

Have I forgotten anything?
You're longer than me.
Happy birthday.
I don't even want you here.
I like to go to new places and see new things.
I have to sit down.
Aren't we friends?

Kate's cold.
I know you miss your family.
What was your plan?
Tom seems bored.
He's not angry.
There's no doubt about who's elected.
He was hurt.
Maybe I should find a new job or an interesting hobby to keep me motivated.
It's weird.
Have you read Sagan about the ring trilogy?
I'm a man now.
Greek is not easy language.
Thank you for taking care of my dog.

Put the cake on the table.
I know you're angry.
Do you need something?
I want a couple of gloves.
That's exactly what I needed.
I'm from Brazil.
I'm already late.
Even Mom knows about it.
He should've already done it.
Room service, please.
Who were you talking to?
The boy took the cat's tail.
How do you know that?
I got a lot of mygging beds.
I'm unemployed.
This medicine will cure your cooling.
Does this remind you of someone?
I would like to talk to Tom between four eyes.
He will fall for the temptation.
The twenty doesn't work.
I can explain that.
She acts like a child.
How does it look?
Mary thinks she has super powers.
I know all this.
Everyone needs to know.
After the stop, the train accelerated quickly.
What did that mean?
Who do you want to talk to?
No one has asked you to agree, but at least you can accept that there are people who have other opinions than you?
Tom put the book down.
I'm the best.
English is hard, isn't it?
I can go to school in ten minutes.
Are you ready now?
She couldn't think of seeing him again.
Even during working hours, I am paying for my Internet dependence.
I never thought it would be so difficult to create an iPad app.
You weren't gone for a long time.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
I can't take myself down to town.
In any case, it wasn't boring.
Can you freeze it down?
Tom blinked with the whole light.
Are you threatening me?
Tom's worried.
I used to like coming here.
This isn't a fish.
Maybe Tom and Mary didn't do what everyone said they did.
Nobody here's called that.
It's time to go.
All three men laugh.
Come sit down.
It's gotta be good.
Tom made his parents happy.
Tom needs me.
My motor soak is broken.
You think she's pretty, huh?
He lived a simple life.
This will take years.

A ink fish has ten arms.
She didn't come before two.
I am.
It was very good.
Come talk to me.

Why do you like that?
What would you say if you were in this situation?
Give me three weeks.
The driver wrestled the wheel to the right.
I'm on the wind.
Tom said he doesn't eat meat.
Did you win?

The cat has two ears.
Not really.
