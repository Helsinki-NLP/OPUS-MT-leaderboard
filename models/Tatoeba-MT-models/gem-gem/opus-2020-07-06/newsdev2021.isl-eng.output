Biden leads the scenarios in three key areas
When there are only 100 days for elections, Joe Biden, the Democratic Promotion Promotion in three important fluctuations.
CNN reports today that Biden was over in Florida, Arizona, and Michigan.
In Florida, Biden meets 51% with 46% with the president.
Arizona is 49%–45% of Biden in the wild, and Michigan is going to the superior Biden, as it leads to 12 points, 52%–40%.
To win the votes in November, after 100 days, Trump needs to turn all these kingdoms, and actually more.
Trump is sitting in these days with a crown virus epidemic that nationals teach him more and more and say that most of the world’s questions have been badly affected, or very bad at the beginning of the past.
In addition, Trump has come out badly from protests and storms that injected George Floyd’s death.
Though Trump and his government have acted badly or wrong.
In order to crown the problems of Trumps, he now sits under more serious criticism for ordering the federal police to break back protests in cities where city or state directors are Democrates.
It has created an enormous calamity among the inhabitants of the cities, and this anger is contaminated to other Americans.
The pictures of the federal police to put Protestants into unmarketed cars have also not helped the United States.
Watching the ad The Lincoln Project precisely attention to this, but it can be seen below.
Trump conquered all three states in 2016, but with very little vote.
Trump actually conquered very many countries with a small difference of votes and won the elections with a minor vote.
For example, Michigan conquered with only 10.704 votes.
It's less than 0.5% inhabitants.
Near all the scenarios that politicians consider important are to show the same conclusion, Biden is taken forward.
A new study of CNN, Arizona, shows that Biden’s predecessor has now come out of the limits of the investigation.
Same way, CNN and Quinnipiac's research on Florida.
In fact, Fox News, who is a good one to the right and expressed support for Trump 2016, has published the same material in its media.
The last hope of the President, according to the findings of the question, is that Trump could expect to reconsider important positions within the fluctuation countries if attention was focused on the economic situation in the election campaign.
After the Covid-19 epidemic, the United States' economy took a heavy hit, but the voters seem not to be related to the economic attack on the crown virus epidemic.
In fact, a large majority of voters seem to teach Trump that they have reacted badly to the crown virus epidemics, but better trust him in dealing with the economic attack that the state is dying at that time.
Trump, however, has failed to conduct the discussion in the election fight.
Following the storms that have fooled almost constantly since the news, the video was incredible, where four policemen kill George Floyd, Trump tried to control the discussion of law enforcement and its importance.
Law and Order, became his unique words.
It seems that it has now failed completely, as earlier said.
As the opinions are increasing on Trump, it is more likely that more and more reputants declare Trump and describe support for some Biden, or someone else who is then Biden without mentioning him specifically.
This is why they do so in the United States to vote in many elections on the same choice.
In this way, the voter can simply mark with the second group of the President’s elections and make it valid as a vote for all its other producers in the voting code.
Thus, the reputations of the Repumblers in other offices were tempted to dismiss Trump’s slowness and to achieve independent success in the elections.
The Olympic Games of Youth in Dakar posted to 2026
The ulympics of the youth were to be performed in Dakar next year, which has now been delayed to 2026 because of the crown virus epidemic after the International Olympics Committee and Senegal reached an agreement on this.
However, the breakdown of the first Olympics in Africa is a shock for many young athletes.
Volunteer arrested for the burn in Nantes
A volunteer in Nantes, France, has been arrested in connection with fires that destroyed the church.
Le Monde, after the prosecutor, admitted that the suspect, a refugee from Rwanda who served as a church overseer, had burned the fire.
In conversation with another media, the man’s lawyer says that he is looking greatly after his actions.
Among what was destroyed in the fire was an angel from the 17th century and historically sculpted windows of the church.
The 39 - year - old volunteer, who has not been mentioned by name, was arrested shortly after the late 18th July, but was so released.
He was then returned to a report yesterday, and he was hoped to guard after that.
"No way out of this"
I am welcomed in Baltasar’s and Christian Samper’s home in Copawoga.
My visit is a new video show of Baltasar and his daughter, Mireya, which will be opened 1 August in the Load of Little Kambi on Snowfield.
Is this the first time that the fathers show together?
I'm headed down to Baltasar's office, where magnificent paintings look at me.
Large and magnificent pictures of clergy in the past, but also of flying creatures; an arrow on one, birds shade on another.
From the workplace, the home is outdated.
“We were with a horse here with us that bite the grass,” says Baltasar to me.
“ The horse works much better than a sliding machine on these cabins and hills we have. ”
Mireya is with us the Christian and Baltasar, and she tells us how her works react to the works that are here.
“Instances, mixtures of paperwork and scratch sculpture.
They're all very white and in contrast to what Dad's doing, where I'm working with the light and so," she says.
“ It’s a year since this idea came up.
Then there were certain works that I was working on and wanted to show there, but they were trapped in Tokyo by Covid.
When my dad began painting, and I saw where he was going, I reconsidered my part," says Mireya, but Baltasar's work has a strong divorce in Icelandic legends about women's grains and waxes.
“ When I saw that my dad was doing these paintings with the clergy, ” says Mireya, but she works with Sigurde Geen Bjarna son of gold in the store Sign.
"So I'll make the installation out of the tail."
In the last year, Mireya attended a show of 72 artists of the Academy of Snowfellsnesi, including in the Load of Little Kambi, and found the building intriguing.
“ This is a new room, an old load that has just been done up, ” says Mireya, who talked to Baldvina Sverris daughter, an artist who made a show together by Mireya and Baltas.
“ She wanted us both to show, and then we thought:
“ Why not?
That's a good idea."
Baltasar Samper was born in Spain in 1938, and we studied the University of Art in Barcelona before he went to a world trip to study artistic collections and studies.
He arrived here in Iceland in 1961, and he was enveloped by country and nation.
Here he came back shortly later, met his wife, Christ, and has lived here for 57 years since 1963.
Baltasar is an excellent artist, has held a decade of personal visions, and shows with Christ in many parts.
He is the most well - known for his large walls, including wall decoration in the Flatey Church and the fresh in the Divided Church.
“ What affects what I do is the bitter thing that Iceland has and no other place, ” says Baltasar.
“ This is a low sun and these shadows that are stretching and stretching.
As soon as I came here, I thought, "Well, here is a workable work."
Mireya is the oldest child of Kristjöna and Baltasar, born in 1964.
“ There was one thing I knew, it was absolutely clear, that I was not going to become an artist," she asked if she wanted to follow in her parents ’ footsteps.
“ So I went to a math and physics course at high school and did everything I could to get out of this.
Then I realized that I was running.
Then you just have to give up," says Mireya and laugh.
Like her father, she has shown around the world.
Great in Japan, to picture.
All the children of Baltasar and Christ have followed the way of the list.
“ I call this virus, ” says Mireya.
“ There was no way out of this.”
The counts of Icelandair have been in a grey area when airlines were resigned
Icelandair has been in a grey area when the company announced all the airlines in the middle of the creepy.
Then he claims that laws that are meant by firefighters to enter a living house will be considered after the burning of the Brothers City Street.
On July 17, Icelandair is advised to discontinue all the 38 airlines who operated at the company while the airline company was still on the table of State Confederators.
The department was concerned whether Icelandair was allowed to take this resignation and was prepared to resolve the matter for Society Judgment.
However, there was never the end of the airlines and Icelandair together a day after the resignations.
On the other hand, Mr Einar Dadason said that, in his mind, Icelandair’s decision was in a grey area and went to the right person of pay.
“ My view is that this is a certain right to defend wages.
When you are in conversation, when you are in the room of a peacemaker, it's not an option to go this way.
It is quite clear in my mind that this hadn't been true.
I think it is quite clear, in my mind, that men had come into the grave area there what this touched," says Ásmundur.
Thus, he will not speak for other companies to go the same way as Icelandair.
“Man also now sees a dangerous discussion that it is just normal to start up this system to reduce this right, and that’s why I’m totally opposed.”
On the explosive this morning, Ásmundur was also asked about the government’s response to the burning of a brother’s city path at the end of June, where three things died.
Ministers now comment on the study of the case at the table of the House and the Agency for Human Rights, to which he has directed its recommendations.
“ It is in law today that the fireplace cannot enter a living room.
I've asked a House and Man's Agency to examine in particular whether there's a reason for making any legal changes.
I'm ready to present the legal modifications needed to reduce the likelihood that this can happen again," says Ásmundur Einar.
You can listen to the interview with Ásmund as a whole in the player below.
United States said increase pressure on Nord Stream 2 - RT Business News
According to World on Sunday, the U.S. government has made further attempts to force European companies to dismiss the Nord Stream 2 gas management project, led by Russia, who testifies to people who are well - known to discuss the matter.
According to the newspaper, officials of the Federal Foreign Ministry, the Federal Ministry of Finance and the United States Energy Office have contacted European firms to ensure that they are aware of the consequences of continuing to the project.
Until 12 officials should have held at least two network meetings with representatives of the companies in the last days.
Those who witnessed the discussions said that the Americans had in a "friendous" tone emphasised that the United States wanted to prevent Nord Stream 2 from being reality.
"I think this is a very, very serious threat," said one thirst to the German media.
These threats are in line with Mike Pompeo, U.S. Secretary for Foreign Affairs, last week, when he warned that companies involved in the project would be best to “come out now” or have a risk of punishment in accordance with 232 parts of the celebrated Law Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
In addition to the Russian energy operator Gazprom, who is responsible for the development of the project, five European companies are involved in it.
These are the French company Engie, OMV from Austria, the British-English company Royal Dutch Shell as well as Wintershall and Uniper from Germany.
In a conversation with the World on Sunday, the representative of the last company said that the United States' attempts to bury “a significant sub-project” would be a clear intake in the sovereignty of Europe.
Previously on the week, the United States Representative approved a change in the law on landguards intended to extend the United States penalties against companies participating in the establishment of the Russian North Stream 2 gas guide.
According to one of the legislature transmitters, the results can be directed to companies who pay or submit ships, security, refusal or connection services for such vessels, as well as those who offer a certificate for Nord Stream 2.
Both European companies and official officials have repeatedly described their displeasment of the United States’ efforts to interfere with European energy issues by applying punishment against North Stream 2 and have even called for some of them to be able to operate in the light of Brussels.
Moscow authorities have also critically criticized Washington’s operation and called it unfair competition.
Earlier a week, president Dmitrij Peskov said that Russia would set up a new plan on how the mission will be completed if the Washington ministers hold the new punishment to stress.
Prepare for further transport of official bodies to land
The Minister for Social Affairs and Children's Affairs plans to transfer more official bodies to the country next.
The Brunavarnaszone of the House and Human Action Agency will be transferred north of the Saoedarkrite to the decision of the Administrator, but experts in the department have previously declared that they intend not to move to the north.
The Associated Minister for Social Affairs and Child Affairs, Einar Dadason, said this morning in Expengising on the Bylgow that it was important for the inhabited country to be transferred to official establishments.
Therefore, there is a high value creation that also produces diversity.
“ It is nationally important, we are trying to build everything around the country.
Working construction, money-building, whether in travel services, in agriculture, in industry, in some form of natural exploitation, and this type of work as public work they are very well supported for this construction," says Ásmundur.
“ Making more diversity, creating better support for this resource utilization and the creation of the nation’s money ears. ”
The Consultation for the transfer of the fireplaces of the House and Human Working Agency has been strongly criticized by its employees and the National Association of Fire Forces and Disease Transporters.
Six people who have expertise in burning matters and work in the department are all resident in the capital area, and none of them are planning to move homes to South Africa.
“ I think it is quite clear that there are politically divided views of how hard to do so.
My opinion is, and has always been, that we should attack in radical actions to distribute the public jobs better," says Ásmundur.
“We see that our neighbours, our neighbours, the Nords, and Danir have done this with good success.”
He is convinced that the vast majority of the nation want to see a greater distribution of public institutions around the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of official work to the country, just as I was doing with the House and Man’s Agency.”
He takes examples of the transportation of the Food Agency to Selfoss, Iceland’s Landmarks to Akraness and joblessness security to Skagastrand.
“ There is a workplace on Skaga beach today that is important for that community.
I think we should take further steps in this being."
“ I’m preparing further steps in this creature.
More transport."

Mr Gottlieb warns that the uninterested spread of the crown virus in society will make it very difficult to open schools in the autumn
Washington — Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former director of the United States Food and Pharmaceutical Monitoring, warned on Sunday that it would be “very difficult ” to open a new study year if the crown virus spreads without delay within these communities.
“ I think school authorities need to look at the distribution within the community everywhere.
If the virus spreads unhindered in the community, it will be very difficult to open in that state," said Gottlieb in "Face the Nation".
As a contemporary to begin in the next few weeks, Trump’s government had encouraged school authorities to open their schools for students and to provide training in schools five days a week.
However, these attempts of President Trump and Minister of Education Betsy DeVos come a week after Trump warned that the crown virus epidemic would probably “very worse before it improves” and confirmed that school examples in those places where the situation is worst could have to delay school opening for a few weeks.
Nevertheless, on Thursday, the disease - resistant centers gave instructions on how safest school was to open for students.
The instructions include the removal of people’s loyalty, students and staff in schools, as well as the use of face resistants, and the sharing of students into limited groups to reduce infectious routes.
However, the disease - resistant centers did not give school governments the level of when to close schools if crown virus emissions are increasing, as Godlieb says has been “unhappy. ”
“ When this uncertainty situation has not been given precise instructions about how schools will be opened, I think that more parents will be careful, ” he says.
“Therefore, I think it is very important to obtain accurate information about the standards exactly which the disease defence centers did not provide in their instructions.”
Godlieb said that school examples must consider the proportion of positive infections in the community, local spread, and testing when decisions are taken on whether to keep schools open or to switch the alpha to learning online.
If between 5 and 10% analyses give a positive finding “is going to be a problem” but more than 10% is“the threshold when considering whether the school judgments should be closed.”
“ This is a sign that the epidemic has reached its footsteps in the community, ” Godlieb said, adding that this would make things of Florida, a major crown virus epidemic in the United States, difficult to open for schools next month.
The number of colony viruses has increased to more than 30 countries and Colombia’s high levels than the grave part of the epidemic is present in the solar belt called the southern coast of the United States.
Godlieb said, however, that signs of the beginning to slow down the increase in cases in some countries, including Arizona and Texas.
However, despite the fact that Gottlieb had said that there were “a distinctive signs” of slowing down the tragedy in some countries of the sun bell, “heating in the coal” in other countries, including Southern Caroline, Alabama, Indian and Illinois.
Many government managers have set rules that are obliged to use masks in public spaces and have stopped target reopening to trace the spread of the crown virus.
Gottlieb said that the Kingdom should consider closing bars, limiting the number of people in restaurants, closing movies and other places that offer for entertainment indoors and setting rules on masking use to overcome the circumvention ages, which enable the empire to resume the strict limits set at the beginning of March.
In addition to the fact that various states have made masculine use to a certain extent, some companies have obliged people to use faces.
McDonald's accelerator is the latest company to make the use of the faces and then add into a group of companies such as Walmart, Starbucks and others who have set their own rules on masking use.
Godlieb said that he assumed that more companies would take up a masking family with him, especially since the danger is considered to be great.
“If we can really control the age of the winter until we get vaccines or any kind of treatment that changes the clinical processes of this disease, we can do it with masks, that is relatively simple, something we can all do but that does not change our lives directly and allows us to keep what is very important for us, like keeping some companies open and bringing the kids back to school,” he says.
Despite the fact that Donald Trump last week did not say that he wanted to make masculine use in all the country, he urged Americans last week to use face - resistants and said at the White House’s News Meeting that “they had an effect. ”
Wilfried Zaha wants to leave Crystal Palace, says Roy Hodgson, "It's a good time to expect"
Consequently, Crystal Palace’s advocate Roy Hodgson, the company’s executive, announced that the attendant, Ms. Wilf Zaha, wanted to leave the company.
The elephant has played in Selhurst Park for more than five years and now seems to be on his way, but it has previously been written with a team like Arsenal and Bayern Munich.
Since he is now 27 years old, he will find out whether teams in that quality class are still willing to pay for him high sums, especially in the financial uncertainty times of sport this summer, after a period of four limits Zaha cut and made five supports for the Palace team, which caused some disappointment.
In a interview with Alex Crook at TalkSport after the last game of the period, Hodgson said that “the news was to expect” about the possible exit of Zaha after confirming that the attendant had “represented clearly” that he would see his future elsewhere than the company.
Three years remaining from the attendant’s agreement with Palace, and last year, the company indicated that 100 million sterling pounds would be needed for the company to shake it.
On the last day of the period, Hodgson ended the period with seven losses in order and a balanced period, which led to a fall to 14th seat.
Zaha found the net meshvana only once from mid-December to the end of the period with long-term losses against Chelsea.
It was reported that he had been asking for sales last summer when he tried to release the company, but no offer was made to tempt Palace to sell.
Zaha changed a representative in January, which seems to increase the chance of getting out of the company, and in the next few weeks, it will undoubtedly be a priority for him to ensure that the company is involved.
Zaha is the player who played most minutes in the English Division for Palace during the period and was the only player of the team under the age of 28 who played 1100 minutes or more, showing how much rebuilding the team might be necessary to deal with the funds available for the player.
The Fellibyl Hanna: The coronary virus in Texas is facing a high risk of seizures in the “two-fold casualties”
Weather news people have foretold “histories” in southern Texas after the turbulent Hanna arrived twice in the country and resulted in high rains and windsights up to 40 feet per second.
When he reached a beach on Saturday, he was classified as a first stage storm (lowest score of five points) and has now been moved down into the tropical storms, but rain could still reach 150 to 300 mm on Sunday, and wind could reach 26 feet per seconds.
In some areas, rain has already reached up to 230 mm, including in Cameron County at the border of Mexico.
Hanna was the first orbit of the Orthodox period in the Atlantic in 2020, and weather scholar Chris Birchfield advised the inhabitants to be careful: “This is not nearly over, but we still expect disasters. ”
In the last few weeks, Texas has suffered a great increase in coronary virus emissions.
The Governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster announcement for 23 stormy storms, including Harris, Fort Bend, Galveston, and Brazoria.
“ All the turbulents are an enormous challenge.
This challenge is complicated and even more difficult in which the turbulence passes through an area that has become the worst of COVID-19," said Greg.
The Fellibyl first came to land at 17:00 a.m. on Saturday, 24 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, some 210 miles [210 km] south of Corpus Christ.
The second time was not far away, in the eastern part of Kennedy County.
More than 43,700 people in Southern Texas, including Corpus Christi, Harlingen and Brownsville, were without electricity on Saturday night.
A need service in Corpus Christ set up gardens near gate conventions to be used if the streets are crossed.
President Donald Trump told U.S. that the government was watching Hanna and Douglas, who was headed to Havai, the Pacific.
Sherry Boehme, who lives on the coast of Corpus Christ, said that the storm approached had increased the anxiety she felt because of the world’s decay.
This 67 - year - old woman had mostly stayed home because of health problems associated with chronic lung disease.
She said: “It's almost like a double pocket for us.
I think a lot of people have become weak.
We'll get through this.
They are all good and strong and stand together."
A fade of a flourishing sailing in Southern
In Southern, the weather has been extremely well in the summers, and the weather has been a good weather for farmers.
Most of them have the first slate, another slate is widely started, and then some are expected to reach the third slate at the end of summer.
The weather has played with southern farmers like other inhabitants of the country in summer and has not corrupted the squad in the towns.
That's why a gentleman has worked well.
The victory of the son of August, the cowboy of the Birtingahole, in the rhunaman's remnant, and the work of the hearing is pleasant and lucky.
“ Yes, it’s just walking well, I think the farmers must just be broken, it’s been a good walk, but it’s been very good weather in the last half of the month.
Heaven are very good, the harvest is good, and the goodness of the sharks is fine all over," says Sigurd.
A victory says that the growth of cowbows, especially in the cowboy, is the most important thing to do in the rolling hooks or outdoors, which have been very well given.
“ It’s lifeful, yes, yes, it’s actually been very comfortable now for the last half of the month or for three weeks, it’s been so dry and good, and then it’s so comfortable to deal with this.
It remembers everything, it's less stress and can be stored until morning sometimes what could be done today, so it's a bright comfortable.
But does the Victory think that any farmers will beat three times?
“ Yes, I could believe it, the first ones.
We started 17 June, it could be that those who were first had to take something three times."

The Officer Adama Traoré, who plays with Wolves in the English department, is an enormous speedy player.
His opposers have had it to grip him in order to make sure that he does not get away with them.
This has caused his shoulder to have dropped several times, but now the wolves have come with the solution to the problem.
The Sun reports about this.
In the game of Wolves against Crystal Palace, the hospitalists could see something on the shoulders of Traoré.

“ Making him more lethal makes the defenders more difficult to grab him, so we can avoid further injury. ”
Traoré’s shoulder fell out first when Wolves played against Tottenham in December.
Since then, the shoulder has fallen out of the team four times, now the last against Sheffield United before this month.

Stott, in conversation with Sky News, said that the content of the book about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was in no difference between the content of the sludge magazines, the only difference was that the book was embedded.
The former soldier wants to see more and more directly to the positive things that their husbands have done, such as their good - being work.
Stott said: “I feel that what is shown there is no difference between what we read in the newspapers, except now in an internal book. ”
“ There is a historian who tells, yet there is nothing sure that this is from them. ”
“ I think this is just one more attack on them, just like the sludge magazines that persecute them. ”
“ I realize that they are in the light, and people want to know what they are doing, but I wish it was more discussed about all the good things they have done and their good work rather than their personal matters. ”
“ Of course, they will never get rid of it, because of their position. ”
The support of the Duchess and the Duchess of Sussex shaded the other members of the king’s family, a expert in the history of the king’s family.
Dr. Kate Williams told Sky News that the king’s family had not been able to use the starry of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.
She added that the order of power within the king’s family was firm, but it was not possible to control the interest of the public.
She also said: “The fact is that everything they did to support the queen had a tendency to overcome other members of the king’s family, and this was considered to be a problem. ”
"They are extremely popular."
“ They had less wedding than most sisters in the same position, Andrew had a huge wedding, and Anne also had a huge wedding. ”
“ But although Harry and Meghan’s wedding were smaller than Vilhelm and Katrina, the news of it was as much, because of the great interest of the world’s inhabited couple. ”
Donald Trump admits that he often looks after his voice on Twitter
Donald Trump has acknowledged that he often observes his posts on Twitter, which brings peace.
In a interview with Barstool Sports on Friday, the president of the United States said that his unintentional reconstruction on Twitter channels — some of whom have included material from the white races – would be in the most troubled.
When journalist Dave Portnoy asked him if he could see his records, Trump replied: “Of, too often.
It was so in the old days, before this came, that you wrote a letter and said that this letter was very big.
You put it on your desk, and then you returned the next day, saying, “Oh, how glad I am that I don’t send it, ” right?
But we don't do it with Twitter.
We send it out immediately, we feel great, and then you start calling — “Did you really say this? ”
I say, “What is this? ” and you get different.
Last month, Trump caused great anger after rebuilding the entry (shared material from another account) with a video of his supporters in the Villages region in Florida, where an elderly couple called “White power” or “the choice of white”.
And in 2017, Trump restored three posts directed against Muslims, published by Jaydu Fransen, leader of the Britain First.
The President told Portnoy that the rebirths that had brought him into the most difficulty
Trump said: “You see something that looks good and doesn’t examine it, you understand, and you don’t know exactly what’s on your helmet, which’s a little bit smaller and you don’t grow it, sometimes – I’ve found out that there are almost always the refreshments that bring you into trouble. ”
The president often shares commendation to himself, voice of his opponents and conspiracy with 80 million of his followers on Twitter.
Trump says that Twitter helps him to get through the so-called "false news" in television programs and newspapers that he says is unfair.
However, the president’s own lies have often proved to be under the microscope, and now Twitter means Trump’s records as distinguishing.
The GPS system may be unsafe
Many states work to develop different location techniques than the GPS system.
The engineer explains that reason might be to worry about the security of the GPS system, which belongs to American armies.
The old Loran system has been renewed.
The GPS technology will follow us every footage.
We use it when flying, sailing and driving, with land measurements, in industry and holidays.
Most people think that it is a military instrument in the possession of the United States, which opened it first before the general use of the nineties of the last century.
The GPS technology uses satellite nodes to 200,000 miles above the earth, so conditions in nature have little effect on it.
“ But it’s very easy to interfere with her.
And malicious people can easily interfere with the receipt of these marks," says Sämundur E. Thorsteinsson, lecturer of engineering at the University of Iceland, and expert on the risk management and security of telecommunications.
He also easily tells us to send errors with wrong location, for example in war.
“The GPS system is owned by the Defense Department of the United States.
They have assured the public that the system exists at all times.
But surely they can shut this off if it threw into the head of a very wise President to let such things do, then he could expect to do it," said Sømundur.
Thus, many states have come to mind other systems and location techniques.
Both Russia and China operate their own satellite systems, and the European Union is breaking off Galileo's positioning system.
“The Galileo system is primarily built for civil use.
It may be more precise and naturally under the rule of the European Union.
Then there is not one government who is absolutely in charge of it, but many, says Semundur.
But many have also looked back to the old loran technology.
It is based on radio waves and was used from the 1960 ’ s and until the GPS technology took over.
The Lóran marks are sent on very long waves from the ships down on the ground.
“ It is then a new version of the Lóran system called eLoran, which stands for Enhanced Loran, that people are seriously considering it in many countries to have it as a system for warning, because some other laws have to interfere with it, which is much more difficult than to interfere with a satellite system,” says Sømundur.
However, it is likely to be safest to have access to most location systems.
Experienced Senator Vern Buchanan, who died by the crown virus
“Gary was a professional in a fingery and a loyal servant of the official,” said Buchanan on Facebook.
“ He touched so many people and was loved and delighted by those who knew him.
I will never forget how resurrective he was, the sense of humiliation, and the unique joy that he received from helping others."
The Buchanan’s office published a statement in the past month, in which there was no recent relationship with others in the office.
Tibbetts, who worked outside the office, had been working for Buchanan from 2011.
Florida has reported 414,511 cases from the beginning of the world’s epidemic, more than 411.200 in New York, according to the government’s health authorities.
The data of the government’s health authorities show that hospital entrance has increased by 79% from the United States’s festival day, July 4.
The data also show that at least 50 teams in Florida reached endurance on Saturday.
“ We announced that this could affect, ” said DeSantis in June.
“At the same time, police work and refusal to do so could have a negative effect.”
Flying from Snakefire to Cape Town
Turkish doves, rosesters, ringdives, fluxed nees, bruises, and grays are among the birds that have fled to land in summer.
On the birds’ web of Southeast birds, there are nearly short news every day about the flickers, where they have been seen, and sometimes their gender.
They are many birds in Iceland.
To that end, the number of people who like the Facebook page can be mentioned.
The members of the group are about 14600.
There are portrayals of birds, and it is clear that Iceland is rich by good photographers who have the patience needed to form birds.
Brynjulf the son of Brynjulf is one of them.
Binni, as he is called, is a worker of the Southeast and the Southeast Natural Labor, and he is carefully watching the bird life in that area.
He speaks beautifully of these animals that make the world rich in Iceland and play a vital role in this field, and then it doesn’t matter whether the bird is a large, huge bird or a small sparrow.
In 2005, the birdhood center was set up on the birthday of the Pentagon of the Bajarn son of Knews in Swede, with the aim of keeping air and continuing the significant natural studies he had been conducting since 1940.
“ At the age of thirteen when he began to feed information about birds, ” says Brynjulfer in a conversation with the Kernel.
“We at the bird’s center are not doing exactly the same thing as half-then did, but we are building on his data by counting and marking birds.”
Halfth was a farmer and a population scientist, born 14 March 1927.
He wrote a number of scientific articles about plants, insects, and birds.
He died February 10, 2017, almost nine years old.
Hence, half his brothers and sisters on the Quaskars grew interest in many of those whom they met in Icelandic nature.
In that group, Björn Gisli Arnarson, the “the employee” of the bird mind station.
Bear grew up in the Reynivals of the Southern Army, and he had a rich natural gap with his neighbors, a half of the Crowns.
What, though, is the bird - minding center in Southeast?
About March 20, each year, the bird - minding center sets up a special bird plant in Einarslund, a timber dose within the Harbour of the Hornfire.
There are standard labels for the birds that come into the nets.
The nets are taken down around May 10, when the warp time starts.
The nets are up every day, at least from about six o'clock in the morning, and beyond the noon.
And they have to visit every hour.
The birds in them are marked, measured, and then released into freedom.
Every hour, a reporter asks the miracle.
“ Yes, we share this with us, me and Beash.
Since we now need to work for us, this can be a lot of pause game, but somehow we can do this," says Brynjulf.
The networks are then rebuilt during the period 1 August to 10 November — all the days weather permits.
Between watching the networks and the periods they do not exist, bryne and bears mark crowns, shoes, and various mosquitoes when they reach them.
In addition, they take a number of special tasks.
One of these tasks is being cooperated with the Icelandic Institute of Natural Sciences and is about collecting birds of forest birds.
“ The shoe smile jumps on the birds at their winter stations and then gets them to the country in spring.
This is happening shortly before they leave, and therefore they are not big when they come to Iceland.
Then he jumps out of the bird and trys to find someone else's house when he needs it."
But it's enough for a bitch.
Asked about how the birds in Southeast have this summer, Brynjulf says that the warp of the crown seems to work well — as it over the head of pain.
“ The warp of the warp here is at Hala in the Southern Army, and there it is fine.
But there is no warp to find any more at Jökulsarlon, where a few years ago there was an enormous throw."
He says that a few years ago, more than a thousand crackers had been worn there, but now they can be counted on the fingers of another hand.
“ When we look at birds of mosquitoes and wheat, I feel that it has decreased in the last few years what you feel of them.
But of course there's always a change between years."
According to Brynjulf, what can explain the great change is likely to be a matter of food supply.
"It's all about food."
In that case, humans may also have their actions to say about the offspring of birds and other animals.
However, some birds seem to have quite good in Southeast this summer.
“ One of the positive things I think is choosing is to grow back after a great lowness, ” says Bruynjulf, “but while the shoes have shaken terrificly last and decades. ”
From sparrows, it is to hear that the marijuana seemed to walk well in his hood in summer, as in the past.
Forests and dufts had decreased slightly, but Brynjulf says it does not appear until in the past how this summer was.
But let's turn to the flickers.
Often they raise great attention, especially if they are very unseen and even colorful.
These two interesting factors relate to one of the most popular elements of the summer: The Roman.
“ Otherwise it has been relatively calm in the summers of the complications, ” says Brynjulf, but mentions that in the country there is now crying, and then the ringdubs have been seen and are getting worse here.
As well as other birds, when Brynjulf and Björn get into the complexes, they also mark them.
There are international significances, and they are operated worldwide.
The meanings of the birds, where they are, and where they are.
“ It is even possible to see how long they are on a flight, ” says Bruynjulf.
This information is beneficial in many ways, to produce in the case of birds such as birds.
“ There’s always been an increase in knowledge.”
If someone else in the world finds a bird marked by the Southeast bird’s center, the information will be sent to the Icelandic Institute of Natural Science.
“ We have been recovered from Cape Town in South Africa.
There was a crown that we had marked.
One crown from us was found later in the United States."
One bird is especially the bird’s mind, and it’s the shoe.
“ The bird is our bird, ” he says, pointing out that the birdhood center and its Southeastern National Institute are the assignment to observe his seed — which has become quite slow, and now he is on the vacant.
It is difficult to claim what has caused a decay in the base, but one theory is that the shoe made a seaside that was previously thrown from fishing boats and out into the sea is good than that it is now far better used and it affects the shoe.
Are you in the best place in the country to watch birds?
“ You do not naturally get me to say no, ” says Brunjulf laughing, adding: “When we are also chasing the birds of the flick, we must probably go abroad. ”
But surely the Southeast is special when it comes to bird life.
“ This area is like moving into the country from Europe, and then the birds are spreading from here.
Being here is very interesting, but there are fewer guns than many other lands.
It is not far from a feather and to a yoke, so that the area of such things is well suitable for the birds.
But Brynjulf's favorite bird?
He is thinking about for a short time before he answers.
I think the question is difficult.
“ I have found nine of the ten who have seen in the land, ” he finally answers.
“ I find one of the most enjoyable pictures of horsebacks.
It is always a pleasure to find birds that have not been seen before in this country or are rare, so I am not talking about finding a new species for Europe."
But they both have done so with Binni and Bjössi.
If you want to monitor the work of Binna and Bean at the Southeast Fuglite Centre, you can watch their work on Facebook and on the birds.is web.
Saudi Arabia — the sunshine of the future? No alcohol or bikini
The tourist industry has grown enormously widely in the past few years, and now the authorities in Saudi Arabia want to get their cuts off the cake.
Inspected authorities defeat some $60,000 million in the country to create a traveling paradise.
The Guardian reports this.
But this tourist paradise will not be in the way that Ishland and Iceland should be used in southern Europe.
Alcohol will not be offered, and women will not be allowed to sunk themselves in bikinium.
But how, then, should travelers be locked to this fierce Islamic land?
This should be done, for example, by building a new city where white beaches, moons (of course made by humans), drone - id cars, and robots who serve people.
The Guardian says it's Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Sadi Arabia who wants to invest in this investment.
Of course, the money will be searched for the oils of the country.
The crown prince says that there is no discussion that women can release axes and knees in public places but admit that it is not easy to create a traveler paradise in the country, because it is too hot as the sun is high and cannot be trusted in winding.
However, if they cannot buy alcohol, it would not also reduce the interest of travelers.
Francois Bozize, formerly awarded by the Central African Republic's presidency, announces a presentation of the President
On Saturday, the former president of the Central African Republic, Francois Bozize, who had been chaired, announced that he would offer himself in the presidential elections in December, despite the United Nations' penalties, and that an arrest order was issued because of his offensive crimes against humanity.
He announced his presentation in a speech before a large group of supporters at his group, Kwa na Kwa (“work, only work”), in the capital of Bangui.
In 2013, this 73 - year - old former army and military leader was elected in the U.S. rebellion of the largest Muslim rebels from the north, casting the nation, mostly to the Christian, into an overwhelming civil war and a serious and long - term humanitarian crisis.
“The country needs a man with experience, peace and conviction,” said Bozize in a speech criticized at the current President’s office, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize took the lead first after a presidency robbery in 2003, and had been a presidential office for 10 years before he fled the country in 2013.
The new government sought to arrest him for defective crimes against humanity and for encouragement to rhythm, but he has not been arrested since he returned from exile last year.
It is not clear how the arrest order or foreign punishment affects his presentation.
In January, Bozize said that he would ask the United Nations to relieve the penalties set in 2014 due to the impression of support to armed Christian groups of Anti-Balaka.
Touadera today supports the United Nations extensive peacekeeping, which counts more than 13,000 soldiers and policemen.
He was elected in 2016 and is expected to offer himself for a different period of time, but his presentation has not been confirmed.
The first round of the elections will be December 27.
In February 2019, the government signed a peace gathering with 14 armed groups who generally claimed to defend the interests of certain communities or religions.
Since then, violence has decreased, but there are still bloody events that are most often due to conflicts about resources, but the majority of this demantic country are not under the government.
Violence has spent over 1.5 million people to escape their homes.
The location of Gareth Bale at Real Madrid is “inappropriate for all” says Toni Krous
Toni Kroos, center of Real Madrid, says Gareth Bale’s position in the Spanish team is “unacceptable for everyone. ”
Bale did not participate in any of the last seven games of the team and he took a little part in the LaLiga joy of Los Blancos, and now in summer is up the place that the player intends to keep still before and let his contract expire, but the company hopes that he will move on the road.
“ There is no way to avoid the unacceptable situation for everyone, ” said Kroos in Lauschangriff Endlich was mit Sport.
“ He was not bought to play him as little as it is now.
I think he really wanted to leave the company last summer and that the company actually said "yes" but then "no" later.
I don't know if he's still somewhat angry about it.
When he was asked whether the circumstances had a negative impact on Real’s atmosphere, Krus said: “Not as much as possible.
I've known him for six years and we've worked a lot of important together."
The Chinese give smokejanes Bay 2,000 face masks to support the fight against the crown virus
Shipman of the Chinese, Jin Zhijian, delivered the city manager of the city of the Republic of Reychanes two thousand masks of faces over the past week.
The reason was the visit of the city manager to the Chinese Embassy last July 22th.
Wedding news first reported.
The city manager’s visit was reimbursing the Chinese ambassador’s visit in the city of Reykjanes, where he visited the city hall and met with the city manager.
Reports of the Wikar News that it was discussed to promote friendship between the towns of Reyken and the city of Xianyang, but the city communities started their cooperation between 2014.
The gifts, 2,000 face masks, are rooted in this friendship, but the Xianyang city authorities wanted to give masks and thus support the struggle against the crown virus epidemic.
According to the newspaper, the masks will be used in sensitive institutions and offices of the Reyyanes City for both employees and other guests.
In addition to the flags of Iceland and the People’s Republic of China, the inscription of the face mask box stands: “Behind is everyone, except for a brother. ”
Thomsen wants to leave KR - Calculator by lowering wages
Tobias Thomsen is going to try to come home to Denmark, from the Icelandic master of the KR, next month, and say that it is interest from the friends in the Danish first department.
Thomsen has played in Iceland since 2017 and has become Iceland’s master with both Val and KR.
On the other hand, this 27 - year - old attendant says that he is going to miss Danmark and wants to move there with his girlfriend, Stefania the daughter of Jacob.
The Danan Agreement with the CR is to the end of this festival, so it is clear that a Danish society needs to cooperate with the CR for sale to get it in August, before a new season starts in Denmark.
Otherwise, Thomsen would have to wait until winter by coming to Denmark.
“ Yes, I know that the Danish branches start again at the end of August.
It means, of course, that I had to break my deal with KR-inga, but I have told them that I missed Denmark, and they have full understanding of it," said Thomsen to bold.dk.
He added that he had a very good relationship with a trainer of Rúnar Kristin, who had shown his full understanding, and Thomsen said not to think that the price would be a great problem.
“ I have also had a conversation with two first branchmates after that department was finished, and I knew where they would end.
It has been a little concern already about the coming period so it may be that I go to Denmark before the Icelandic department stops," said Thomsen but added that it was clear that there were not many partners in Denmark who could buy up his contract with CR.
“ This is not quite clear now, but it has been interested.
I also need to find the best chance for me and my girlfriend, who is from Iceland and comes with me.
This depends on a few things," said Thomsen, saying, "it looked first and foremost to the Capeman's port.
Thomsen said KR-ings don't have to worry about that he didn't give himself all in exercises and games, even though he missed Danmarks.
“ KR knows what it gets from me, and that is that I do 100 percent of things.
I can quite look over because I miss Danmarks when I'm in practice or in games," said Thomsen, who clearly says he'll fall in the wages we'll leave the Icelandic masters to the next Danish department.
“ I will probably have to lower only in the wages, out of the crown virus crisis, which seems to have crushed the Danish companions just more than the Italian.
But I am also in a study, and one solution could be that a company made me a job.
Most of the companions in the first section are in agreement with strengtheners.
I'm learning sports management through the actors organisation and finishing the bachelor degree," said Thomsen.
Thomsen has only been in the beginning team of the KR in two games in the Pepsi Max Division during this playtime, but came to history in five games and scored one goal.
He started 21 games for the team last year and scored seven limits.
The KR is equal to the valley of the Pepsi Max's score and the game for good, but the team meets KA on Akureyri today.

The campaign is in progress at the same time as 30 years from the position of American law on the rights of people with disabilities that occur on Sunday.
In the video Spencer discusses the importance of seeing themselves and their lives in a real way reflected on the screen.

The clowns displayed on CBS between 1974 and 1979 were made by Norman Lear, and they robbed the way as the first joke factors that showed two parents, both of African origin.
Confessions against hunger push Yoho to side after events in the conference hall
WASHINGTON (AP) – Independent Christian organization that wants to end hunger said on Saturday that they had asked the Senator Ted Yoho to share in the government of the organizations, and that he had been able to do so, after what they called "attack" on the Senator Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez.
Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Demokrate in New York, accused Yoho, the Senator of the Republic of Florida, to use a low-course and male-breaking distress when he reproved her when they met at the stairs of the hall last Monday.
Yoho claimed that he had not used the words quoted, but a reporter who witnessed the event confirmed that the expression had been as she described.
Bread for the World announced that the government of the organizations had met Yoho on Friday and sought to “justify our commitment to stand with women and black people, inside and worldwide, leading us to the world with increased participation of all races and increased justice. ”
On the Bread for the World web page, their “Christian voice” pressed the council and governments to end hunger in the country and worldwide.
“ As Bread for the World is independent of Christian organizations that have the goal of reducing hunger and poverty with reliable public approaches, the organization keeps the respect, honor, and concern that Jesus asks us to show when we deal with people in power, wherever it is on the political color, ” says the statement.
“Our opinion reflects recent activities and the words of the Senator Ted Yoho, who was reported in the media, not the moral requirements made to our government members.”
During the work of the news, Yoho had not answered an e - mail with an invitation to respond.
In an incredible talk at the meeting hall last Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez dramatically spoke from the event and directed her words against what she called male penalty, which “accepts violence and violent speech against women. ”
More than a decade of her companions accepted her words that the event was an example of the very common behavior of men.
Yoho described the event as a short discussion of policy and that “no one had been agitated, insulted or attacked. ”
He said that he was looking after having shown “a contemporary approach. ”
The 30-year-old Ocasio-Cortez is in its first period as a advanced senator and has received both praise and lamentation for her purity.
The 65 - year - old Yoho is one of the most voluntary senators of the Assembly and will sit in a sacred stone after the end of his fourth term.
Wait until the 98th minute in the local index by scoreing the first target of the period
Jesse Lingard had not scored or posted in the English election department during this playtime, until he challenged Leicester today in a 98th minute during the final course of the department.
Lingard had not suspended in the English election department since he suspended twice against Cardiff in December 2018.
He came in as a spareman today for Manchester United when Leicester was a member of the Master Board.
When more than seven minutes were over the usual playtime, Lingard hired the ball by Kasper Schmeichel targetman Leicester and scored the empty goal.
The longest target of Jesse Lingard.
Players of Real Madrid Exempted Regulators of Disease
Zinedine Zidane and his disciples in Real Madrid will be able to meet England in their second game with Manchester City, in the European Master Board, without having to go to two weeks of disease.
The British Government has decided that travelers from Spain have to take two weeks of disease to begin the spread of the crown virus.
However, there are exceptions, as in the case of competitors at the highest stage of sport.
This confirmed the Department of Sports at Sky Sports.
The bureau says that those who are excluded from the rules will only be in limited areas, at the doors.
This applies to sports stars, judges, trainers, medical teams, and media.
Thus, the Madridians can meet Manchester City on August 7, without having to stay in England for a long time, but they are 2 to 1 under the single after losing Santiago Bernabea on February 26.
The victory team continues to be a 8 - year - old final in Portugal.
Rainless rain, and the land of the sanctuary
Reports of overwhelming hotels and tents to judge, in the least southern part of the world, make it clear that Icelanders have been able to travel within this summer.
If those who have undertaken land have been lucky with weather and the DV’s weather donors in one case that the summer has only been purely declared beautiful, to at least here.
But now it comes to a merchant sanctuary that has been the largest sanctuary of the year.
Yet, it is unclear how it will be this year, compared to other weekends, and now events that normally have brought a large number of people to not be held.
For example, it is enough to mention a festival.
The weather will, of course, play a great role, but now it looks like a gloomy rain across the country, but especially south and southwest to.
The weather room foretells a rainfall from Thursday evening and the least until Saturday night.
It should be noted that long - term scenarios are not sacred truth here in the northern Atlantic Ocean and are likely to be able to make changes.
The weather scholar Einar Sveinbearn son prophesied on his weatherweave, Bliku, says that there is a low expectation of the sales sanctuary.
Says he: In the hills with a coal that too often reaches down to the surface, a hot air from the southwest is only a low wind and a result.
Obviously, also warmer air that “smokes” over here north.
One presents his prophecy for support and says: “A small wave from America reaches eastward and with it summerly sound air.
When it approaches, it reaches to “blossoming” in the form of lowering air pressure and supposed summers."
The great prediction, the European calculator to the left on the map, and the U.S. GFS to the right are a little conspiracy with this development.
Understanding the slightness is the foretelling of late Thursday and early on Friday with a rush of A and rain in most of the land.
Afterwards, the 985 hPa medical station will follow.
At this time, some sound air in the North and Austria will be followed on Saturday and even Sunday as well.
On the other hand, it could be blown together.
A man was seriously hurt when a car with cattle chosen in Wexford
A man was seriously injured in a traffic accident earlier today at the Ferrycarrig bridge in Wexford.
A cattle truck ran on the bridge and chopped over to a manless car.
The 34 - year - old driver suffered serious injury in the accident, which occurred at 13:50 a.m.
He was transferred to the hospital in Wexford, where he is heavyly held.
The police's technical department is investigating the field, and the bridge has been closed and by-lined up.
The number of cattle died in the conflict.
The police encourage all travelers from 13:45 to 14:00, who and others who were in the area and could have witnessed the event, to contact the Wexford police station at phone 053 916 5200, police confidential phones in 1800 666 111 or another police station.
Following a Law and Order Player all the way to New York
“I was shot in it like a man gets such a youth shot,” says Birna Rönn Björn's daughter of Mariska Hargitay, the principal player of the Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.
She was then the mountains of the amateur that she was able to take the part and wait for her for hours, just to say hi.
When Birna Rahnn Björn’s daughter, the owner of the travel office Pink Iceland, looked like many Irish people at the Law and Order: Special Victims Unit from the old age, then she carbonized for the main players Mariska Hargitay.
Birna tells the story of her meetings and the actor’s meetings in the Love’s Stories on Rah 1.
When Birna himself was a teenager, at the age many begin to develop with an overwhelming love shot, she did not experience it as her associates because she stood in a struggle with repressing her own teachings.
She thought she was interested in boy - sound teams and young foolish cardiacs from movies, but at all they did not.
“ I was cutting out poppies and hanging pictures on a wall of Backstreet boys and Jared Leto.
But there was nothing behind it, it was just I'm hiding that I was a lesbian."
It says that when people get out of the closet, they sometimes go through a late castle.
“ We spend our teenage years in depressing these youth motives, these shots, and so on.
I think it was one of the things that drew me to her," says Birna about the actress.
“ And there was something with her.
I thought she was a good actress, beautiful and warm, and I was just shot in her look."
When she was supported in New York a few years ago, it ran on the snake of the actor.
One of her best friends, Erling Óttar Thoroddsen, was shooting a movie in the city and got Birna and their friend, Gunnar Helga Godjóns son, to help with the recording.
“ We were working for 30 people, spending a wonderful time with strangers.
This is naturally a warm atmosphere when you spend so long time together a day so it was spoken of everything and nothing."
One day Birna is a great fan of Marisku.
One woman in the team says that her friend knows the actor because he was in the team of the factors.
Birna could not stop thinking about that fact and regularly ask her new friend how her friend might work with her actor and whether Birna can meet her.
“She tells me to stop this, she knows nothing if she can let it happen,” says Birna.
When the film is taken, the group finally finishes, and Birna last time trys to convince the woman to try to get the meeting around.
"She had got a few glasses and said she would just weep it."
A few days later, Birna sends a message to the woman and asks if something is happening.
The woman doesn't answer, and Birna decides to give up.
One morning, she will wake up with a long - long message.
“ I’m watching the phone and screaming.
Gunnar Heilig wake up at the cry, and I say, I have to shower, and I have to make fun, and go down to town.
The woman had then written to Birna that her friend, actors, and the team Law and Order were supported on a hotel at the Times Square.
“ I don’t know when they start or when they stop, but this is the name of the hotel, you go well, ” says the message, and Birna is dressing quickly, asking where the group comes up and takes up the elevator to the 45th floor.
Birna comes and waits until a woman in the staff comes to her and asks this uninvited woman if it can help.
“I say I was looking for Jason and asked the woman to tell him that Birna from Iceland was here.”
When the friend finally arrives, he looks at Birna and asks how she came all the way to the end, it was supposed to be a strict security.
Birna explains that she just took the elevator and asked to meet Marisku.
“ Yes, I don’t know.
Sit down here," says the friend, and Birna's beating.
Besides her, there is an additional feature, and they begin to talk.
“ I say to him, ‘ I am a fan, but you? ’ says Birna.
“ I played this as if this was the most normal thing in the world. ”
It's time and Birna's waiting.
The players are regularly acting when pauses take, they get a snack, and Birna looks around, and they are looking for a Marisku that is nowhere visible.
Finally, the friend comes and tells her that he's sorry to go.
Birna asks him to get his hands on another employee, but she didn’t think she should go anywhere right away.
Astonishingly, the friend agrees with it and reaches another employee.
“He comes with his other friend and says, ‘This is the woman from Iceland who wants to see Marisku.’
Then he goes.
Finally, after two hours, the new friend comes running to Birna.
“ He says, ‘ Hurry. ’
These are unusual circumstances today, there are journalists with her so she won't stop.
She's going the most direct way into the car with them, so you have to take the chance and go down and find her bike.
It's white and it's marked.
Hurry up."
"So I look right and lose my face" Birna passes up and goes down the elevator to the Times Square.
There she finds about forty wheelchairs, some marked, and some not.
On the other hand, Marisku’s wheelchair does not find her, and then it is despair to be put on herself.
“ I feel that the bug is pouring over me because I had spent half a day in this, but I think so well, I tried.
That was fun."
Happy keeps Birna back to the hotel, where she sees through the window of the tape, looking at herself with gracious eyes, clear that Birna did not succeed in her purpose.
Birna agrees with the fate, and it begins to rain.
“ I’m going under a shelter to protect myself from the rain.
Then I look right and lose my face."
Nobody other than Mariska Hargitay stood in her pants, and Birna was well - known — but Birna was hardly able to move from psychiatrist.
“ I look at my body and my hands, and now you have to move.
Now you have to go towards her."
Birds do, and they remember to pitch in the shoulder of the actor's wife.
“ She looks at me, and I can hardly say anything.
But I just say hello," Birna cried up.
“ I say I’m from Iceland and a great fan.
She says, "It's great to meet you."
The interview did not reach much longer because Marisku car is coming and it is floated on it.
Mariska turns to Birna and says: “I have to go, but it was a great pleasure to meet you. ”
Show the god of belief, watch the car drive away, and then broken together.
“ I was calling in Erling and Gunna, and they thought that this wasn’t done.
But I was crying for excitement and joy.
I say, "Yeah, I've met her, you have to meet me now.
Then we pounded into the soda and tequila," says Birna.
She does not notice anything, though she admits that she would probably not repeat the game.
“ It is like this once in life, offering such a time and energy to make it happen.
But I will always be a fan of this woman."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to Birna Rönn Björn’s daughter in the Love Stories of Rah 1.
The police do not spread the virus
There is no reason to worry about the fact that the crown virus can be carried out by the police.
This is what a police officer in the police traffic department in the capital area says in a conversation with mbl.is.
Indications have been made by people who are worried about the use of the same mouthpiece for all drivers when the police take place, take care of a roadway, and let everyone who has a chance of bleaching.
Yet, the police tell the fullest cleanliness.
“ There are really no special mouthpiece, but we have a measure of beaks in which people blow up,” says a policeman.
“Some people want to put their lips on this, but we guide people to keep a little distance, up to a few ten centimeters.”
Ask if it thinks it's enough distance, the policeman says it's.
If it proves to be positive, the police will use another measure.
He has a mouthpiece, but it comes from a sealed plastic bag and is only used once.
Abdominal disorders: Among other things, anish can be initiated to reduce pain
The connection to depression is not random.
Individuals suffering from peripheral inflammation, a disease characterised by abdominal pain, cramps, themes, winding, constipation and diarrhoea, often experience anxiety and depression, which may lead to worsening of symptoms based on anxiety and depression (ADA).
“ This is because the giant is part of the nervous system that responds to stress, ” explains ADAA.
If the theme does not decrease, food intolerance may be considered.
Judge tries to stop the decision that children are released from the immigration of the Day Authority
In his decision on Saturday, Judge Dolly Gee disappointed the expected time limit by saying that the United States' immigrants and customs authorities do not have to release children if they cannot be done by any of the three ways described in their previous order.
However, Gee also emphasized it in its order that the immigrants and customs authorities should remain obliged to release their children without unnecessary delay.
The three paths to which Gee decided are to release families held by the immigrants and toll authorities, to put children into the hands of a responsible person or to release families from the federal judgment.
Shalyn Fluharty, chairman of the Agency Proyecto Dilley, who is giving families a legal service, condemned the decision and told her to put it in the hand of the immigrant and toll authorities to decide whether to continue to have children.
“The main point I feel is that children are being held in a premature prisoner, and they are not released unless immigrants and customs authorities agree to it or families agree to be distinguished,” said Fluharty.
Families are held at three locations of immigrant and toll authorities in Berks in Pennsylvania, South Texas, and the Karnes County of Texas.
The children in these places are between 1 and 17 years old, according to lawsmen and representatives who provide legal assistance.
In June, Gee, who supervises the Flores Convention on the Care of Children, said that, where “regulations on mascular use and social departure were not or not followed, it would be urgent to move children from these offices.
969 subjects in immigrant and tolly authorities have been identified with the coron virus and are in isolation or surveillance from July 23, according to the local authorities.
Of them are 25 confirmed cases in Karnes, one in Dilley, and two in family maintenance centers.
Over 3700 cases have been confirmed in conservation
Will review the law on the independence of governments
The presidency does not say unusually that life - ear taxes set themselves in their investment policy on the rights of workers.
The notes of the Supervisor of the Central Bank to ensure the need for independent governments, possible by law, are taken into consideration.
After Icelandair commenced discussions with the Icelandic Airlines Company and announced all airlines, VR announced that governmenters who were appointed by the VR in the management of the Life Rise of Traders, or paid a vote against the participation of the Bioseye Fund in the expected partial Islelandair edition.
Robert Thor, the son of Ingolf, President VR, continued to say that governmenters would be replaced if they did not go to the instructions.
Ragnar Thorr drew his statement back three days later and, like, the VR.
On Friday, the president of the banks, Mr Johnsson, said in the news of RUV, to guarantee the independence of the governments in the consent of the funds and possible legal change.
The Catholic daughter of Jacob’s presidency says that the rulers of life’s ears are independence, but it is already considered to be legally secured.
“The banking manager, of course the financial supervisor, who has to do with this, has said that it is necessary to consider the regulation around this independence, and we will, of course, take the view if something needs to go over there,” she says.
Katrina says that according to laws, life - ears should set moral standards in their investment policy.
It is important that it deals with the social and moral standards that they want to emphasise in their investments.
“ I did not think of anything abnormal, too, that life - ears also set up their policy of investment on the rights of workers.
But I normally think that such decisions are taken through a policy approach, not through individual investment decisions," says Katrín.
“Intolerant road trips at the Elf Bridge,” says the President of the City Government of Ireland.
The sanctuary of S. Haraldsson, President of the City Government of the Year, says a traffic approach, which is produced by an Elfbridge on Selfossi daily completely intolerant.
He hopes that for a new bridge over the Elf Sea will come to the autumn.
Now that the islanders are traveling through their country, and a high traffic on the country’s roads is creating a daily traffic struggle at the Elf Bridge when drivers are on the way to Selfoss or through the city community.
A long line forms at the edges and can take the patience of drivers to wait in order.
“ Yes, it’s totally intolerant, it’s one traffic stop here and not just on Fridays, because it’s only the word in the active days too.
There are long repentants, sometimes quite up to Hellisheet for those who want to come by on their way east of the country and those who are coming west, so it makes sense that we need to get a new bridge and not later than yesterday," says Saint S. Haraldsson, President of the city of Aurborg.
Helgi notes that the townry authorities in Árborg recently met the head of the Vegatype and the designer of the Vegatype, and that meeting was very positive.
“ If you have ever been optimistic about working in these matters, I think I can say it now because it is really working in this, and we should be able to see that a new bridge is being offered out in the autumn. ”
But is there any counsel to the drivers who are in the queue of an elderly bridge every day in the summer?
“ Yes, you can go through the triangles and through the Eyrarbakka, but those who are going eastward on the shore, they cannot be pointed out to travel to the Lyngdals, but those who are going to the upper forces should use the Mosfellsheet, the Devil, and the Lyngdalsheet. ”
The sanctuary of S. Haraldsson, President of the city government of the city, says the transport team, forming at the Elf Bridge at Selfoss intolerant.
Every day long prayers form at an elf - bridge, and drivers often need to wait for a lot of time to get over the brown.
Then the only way is to breathe deeply and think something positively.
The future of the coal barrels in the northern part of Brisbane prevails for organizational judgment
The city government said that, in addition to the vital home of coalabars, the sweeps, and the gray ghashock, it would be an important gambling between the Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek.
The operators have proposed the rejection of civil governments to the Court of Justice of the Organization and the Environment by reasoning that the construction is in line with civil society laws since 2014, would meet the organisational and social needs that have not been fulfilled and “can be done without an inadmissible effect”.
There is great opposition to these planned implementations in the neighborhood.
The executives argue that, despite the fact that the case is fully in line with the organization, it would be possible to change if it did not meet requirements rather than reject it.
As it includes many stages, including service stations, childcare, and 39 apartment houses.
Public broadcasts were more than 120 at a consensus time, and most of them protested the suggestion that it was too large and inappropriate for the area.
The leader of the minority in the city government of Brisbane said that the city had to buy the land to protect the coal tree.
“[Born Manager] Adrian Schrinner has to stop suspending taxpayers' taxpayers in the fight against the executives for judgment and buying this country to protect the natural and animal life of Brisbane," said Cassidy.
“ These are one of the most important homes of coalabars in the natural area Mountain to Mangroves and there is a number of coalabars.”
In the week, Schrinner said that the city government wanted the coal bears in the area to be defended.
"We found the fact not suitable for the area," said Schrinner.
“ I understand that this is now going through the judgment system, and obviously, we hope that it will result in a good and positive outcome that will help the home to be preserved. ”
Schrinner noted that a map of coalbear homes was a common responsibility of civil government and governments, but that the government is responsible for accurate maps of coalbear homes that local authorities support when applying for treatment applications.
Sunshine: Next step is to work something
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, trainer Man Utd, hoped that the team had secured a third seat in the English election department today.
The team will therefore play in the European Master's Board over the next period.
United needed a seal or victory against Leicester today and was the result of the 2 to 0 victory of the Red Devils.
“ A great achievement for the players to reach a third seat in terms of how the situation has been during the period.
I think that we could have overcome spiritual slopes by working such a great game, since we have lost twice in the outlook during this period.
We knew we needed an end today, now we can have the next chapter that is for these boys to win titles," said the sunshine victory.
Manchester United has still the possibility of working the title during this period, but the team plays in the European Department in August and is as good as the 8-learn conclusion there.
Arms breaking starts at midnight in the war-shaped East Ukraine
Chiev, Ukraine – the Ukrainian army and the opponent powers of the eastern Ukraine are now preparing a “complete” arms break that should begin at midnight and which representatives hope to be the first step towards peace for 6 years after a struggle.
On Sunday, representatives of opponents said that they had ordered their soldiers to stop weapons and issued a ban on the use of weapons.
The Ukrainian army said that his guns have been “prepared” for the gunshot.
If this was to be done, it would be the “suitable way for the implementation of other regulations” of the Minsk Peace Assembly according to the Statement of President Ukrainian office earlier in the week, where the arms break was called a time-to-date clause.
The Minsk Peace Assembly, which was made in 2015 by France and Germany, was to resolve the conflict between Ukraine and the separationists enjoying Russia's support, which began in 2014 following the entry into force of Russia on the Crimean and the support of the country to the separation.
More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict.
On Sunday, the presidents of Russia and Ukraine rejoiced the two arms breaks at the telephone, emphasizing the importance of implementing the convenience reached at the Paris meeting in December.
Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, revealed concerns about the call for a review of the Minks meeting and said that the opinion of Volodimir Selenskij, Ukrainian President, “the invariability of the Minsk Convention, which he again revealed in this conversation, should be reflected in real actions”.
However, Selenskij stressed the need to take action to liberate the Ukrainian prisoners of rebels in Eastern Ukraine, on the eminent Crimean and in Russia, as stated by the President's office.
According to the 2015 agreement, Ukraine can only be dominated over borders with Russia in the areas of the separation, when they have received a wide range of self-regulation and when the elections have been held in the areas.
The gathering decreased, but Ukrainian armies and rebels have continued to be shot.
When the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany met in Paris in December for other discussions, the support of the Minsk Convention was revealed and agreed to restart the peace process.
Selenskij, who won the elections in 2019 with promises to terminate the conflict, wanted Ukraine to take over the borders for the first regional councils, but the Kreml government demands that the agreement be made without any change.
On Wednesday, the new arms-off conference reached the three-way cooperation group, appointed representatives of Russia and Ukraine, as well as the European Security and Cooperation Agency, and was therefore welcomed by EU officials.
At the conventional Sunday blessing on Peterstorg, Pope Frans also referred to the arms break, saying that “rebuilding trust and setting the foundation for the very necessary and long - term peace with the people. ”

A wide moment of his first victory from June 29, the IA, 5 to 3, in the Pepsi Max Department of Men at the Copeavogsfield tonight, won.
On the other hand, men lose their third game in order in the department.
After working their first three games in the department, Broadcast five games played without joyful victory and had lost three in a row before the game with the IA tonight.
So it was to do or kill for Blika who came with great power into the game.
Alexander Helgi, the son of Sigurdar, led the team with a pleasant fee in 11 minutes after Christin Steindor, the son of Steindor, had sent him through the protection of IA.
Six minutes later, the Christian doubled the leadership after the special lawful preparation of the Son of Gisla Eyelf on the left.
There were neither lands nor beaches in the former halfgames, where the high pressure of the locals made them extremely difficult to connect shipments together.
In the 36th minute of the dance Thomas Mikkelsen had all the powers on the field, and the third target was cut in the corner of the Gunnlaug son’s throat.
Then Christ Steindor, his son of Steindor, cut his second goal, and the fourth mark of Blika only three minutes later.
However, the previous half-play did not end there.
Shagamans got a hopeful joy for the second time when Tryggvi Hrafn Haraldsson chose out of a quiz shortly for a pace, but Kwame Quee had then crushed the Viktori Jonah’s son in the Teigs Blika.
Thus, 4–1 was the place for a wide moment when the semiconductor flux was defected.
Only three minutes were over of the second half game when Skagamen scorched again.
So John’s son’s throne was alone and unauthorized on the marketmarket Blika, and easily directed the ball into the network after the corner of the quest of the Trojan of the son of Harald.
On the other hand, when he broke Alexander Helga, he became breached within the deck of IA only three minutes later.
The viticus was judged, and Thomas Mikkelsen chose for safety to bring the 5 to 2 wide moments when only seven minutes were over of the second half game.
Five minutes after Mikkelsen's goal, Skagamen again scored.
The son of Anton Ari Einar, the markkeeper of Blika, suffered pressure from the son of Viktori, John, and gave the ball to the foot of Viktors which the ball rejected in the network.
Unbelievable 5 - 3 situations were faced when less than ten minutes were over of the second half game, but it slowed down the target cut.
Despite fine, both joints could add to the limits, including two Kwame Quee's deaths from the Bretagne, they were not more than 5–3 winners of the Bretagne game.
From June 29th, the first victory, with 14 points at the third seat, two stages from Val, which is sitting above and three from the top of CR.
However, KR and Valur have both games in Blika.
IA needs to meet the third loss in order, but the team has ten points in the eighth seat, five points from the fall.
Despite the words of the White House, the Hvalpas team is not in danger
The manufacturers of the Hvolpas team had a privilege yesterday not to stand up to stop displaying the child’s material in the near future.
The announcement follows the words of Kayleigh McEnany, the White House's Media Representative, that the factors, inter alia, relating to law enforcement dogs, were the victims of "excluding cultures" (e.g. cancel culture).
Canadian producers quickly responded to McEnany’s words and stated that their fans would not have to worry about the future of the Hvolpas Army.
A number of television series dealing with police activities have been taken from a show in the United States after a protest against police violence.
However, the Hvolpas team does not include it, despite its reputation for the social media.
At a newspaper meeting in the White House on Friday, McEnany said that President Trump of the United States was opposed to "exclusion" and especially when it came to the police.
The term refers to when individuals or businesses raise a hard response to social media, and is called for a disproportionate approach.
“ A few weeks ago, we saw the stopping of showes at the Hvolpas team, a child’s material for cops.
The same is with the Cops and Live PD," said McEnany on Friday.
Then she added that the Danish toy manufacturer Lego took a lawsheet from sale, but there is no foot in that claim, according to the defenders of Lego.
However, the facts of the Cops and Live PD have recently been taken from the show of the West Sea.
Both participants are interdependents for showing images of real police activities without allowing individuals to be published there.
Together for 29 Years - Sometimes jealousy and ignorance occurs
Christin Tomas daughter - in - law family career answers readers’ questions about matters relating to the family, children, and love of the DV family.
This time, she answers readers who have never been single.
We have been together since we were 15 years old, have been together for 29 years and have two children.
We know nothing but being together, and we feel good, but both of us have felt like we're missing something.
We have never been with others, and we have no comparison of how this could be different.
This has sometimes resulted in jealousy and lack of confidence in whether the other party is looking around, thinking about divorce or even divorce, and changing.
When we talk about this, we agree on cultivating our relationship, but this is such a mare that always hangs over us.
Do you have any advice?
Thank you for a great question, and I am glad you have so open communication that you can discuss your complex feelings in connection with your relationship.
What would scare me would be if you were thinking this in each corner, couldn't talk about this and even step some steps that you could see later.
Everything on the tables, isn't it always the best?
Strong self - defining has the most predictable for happiness in the future and the stronger your self - style, the more likely you get a partner with a strong self - style.
The reason that relationships that begin in teenager years do not always last the whole life is often that people grow in each direction, but in those cases where they become more friendly, individuals can become stronger than many others.
Since your relationship begins to be made during your greatest formation years, you may conclude that you have grown together and have a positive impact on each other’s self - style.
In fact, we are encountered by our relationships.
The way I speak, is shaped by how you listen.
The way I show me depends on how you see me.
A relationship forms who we are.
Could you turn the example and think: ‘ What do we have that others do not have?
What does this year’s specialty give us?
I am allowed to claim that the benefits can be much more than the mistakes.
You have shaped each other for years, and for this reason, you are customized to each other.
That's more than many can say.
That's worth it?
You are talking about the experience that you have missed something, but it is important to remind yourself that major changes such as divorce and new relationship are also accompanied by companions for which you are not necessarily excited.
You may be losing from restarting, learning to be alone again, knowing a new person, and putting up a family.
They follow new challenges, different problems, and possible something new and exciting.
But this is not just a light cloud and luck, no, at your age, this can become a foolishly complex task, which may never be as good as you have already done each other.
Is that worth it?
Wouldn’t it also be recommended to put the ecclesiastes on what you can do to increase your excitement, unforeseenness, and new ones in your relationship?
You haven't put shoes on the hill.
There are so many things you can do to make this long relationship even deeper.
What attempts can you make in this regard?
What do you need from your mate you're not getting?
What can you give to your mate that you have never done before?
You may need to sit down and redefine your relationship.
Do you want to spend more time alone or together?
Do you want to try something new?
Today there is much more tolerance to various forms of relationship, and pairs are now defining their relationships in various ways, such as open relationships, multi - treasures, or choosing to cease temporarily.
I'm not telling you what you're supposed to do, but no expert in your solutions, but perhaps it would relieve this heavy maize that mourns over you, if you look into this and think in solutions.
So, what do you need to trust and fear?
You've been together for 29 years, it must mean that you're able to do things together.
Use it as strength and keep your hands in the direction of your solution.
We urge readers to send their questions and disappointments to Christine in e-mail at: hjonabandssaela@gmail.com.
The questions will then be answered here in the Family corner, of course unnamed and in full faith.

After conversations between the football mates went out in the dust, their acquaintances expect dramatic performance
Coleen Rooney has advocated the astrologer in the case of Johnny Depp to defend himself in his so-called "Wagatha Christie" law against Rebekah Vardy.
The Mail on Sunday suggests that Rooney was obliged to defend David Sherborne against the accusations that she had suffered harm against Vardy, claiming that personal information had been revealed to the media of her closed Instagram access.
A few days after data were submitted to the Supreme Court, reports that Rebekah Vardy, who is married to the attendant Jamie Vardy in Leicester City, suffered physically and spiritually after Coleen Rooney’s claim.
The 38 - year - old mother explains that the five - year - old mother “had been plagued with severe pancreas and anxiety so that she was afraid to go out of the house ” and that Vardy, who was then seven months on the way,“ had been put into hospitals three times... because of anxiety that could result in the entry and consequences of her. ”

Coleen’s lawyers have doubted these words and said that the claims on her suffering are only presented to the media and draw attention from the facts of the matter.
The author said: “The Becky’s documents are the result, this is all the source. ”
It is the lawyer Paul Lunt at the Brabner’s Law office in Liverpool, who deals with Coleen Rooney, who has four sons with the former British master Wayne Rooney.

The Cosningateym Bidens denies 'Fox News Sunday' on a one-week interview following Chris Wallace interview with Trump
Last week, Trumps interviewed Chris Wallace, President of the United States, doubted that the prospective President Promotion, Joe Biden, would handle the questionnaire that Wallace dropped on Trump.
That question may never be answered — at least not for a while.
On Sunday, Wallace informed the audience that the Bidens council had told Fox News that he was “not free” in an interview.
“In our interview with President Trump last week, he doubted that his opponent of the Democratic Group, Joe Biden, would plumb himself in similar situations,” said Wallace.
“ During the week, we asked the Bidens council for an interview, and they said that the former president of the reserve was not free. ”
“We continue to ask each week,” he added.
Trump’s Cosningateum has been criticizing Biden for months for avoiding elections and news meetings during interviews during the crown virus epidemic.
Although Biden has recently restarted his elections, Trump and his companions have continued to hesitate to the former President-in-Office of the Delaware's home because they were “safe” in their homes.
However, the danger of Bidens to meet a public event has not been delighted for his presentation, since recent studies show that Biden has a good presumption on Trump both nationally and in major battles.
Mean numbers of Real Clear Politics indicate that the president was 7 percent below in Florida, 6.7 percent in Pennsylvania, 8.2 in Michigan and 6.4 in Wisconsin.
Trump worked in all the four kingdoms in 2016 when he turned them over to the Repumbler class when he worked the fight about the White House.
In the latest research Fox News Poll, Biden has a forefront in Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, in all cases.
The research also suggests that Biden had a little advance in Ohio, North Caroline, and Arizona, three other important fighting forces in these elections.
And the research suggests that the former Republic of Republic of Reputations, such as Texas and Georgia, is now divided between Trumps and the former President of the Resurrection.
Presidential elections in which the chairman offers himself for another period of choice in the White House are often a vote on that president — and this seems to be the case in 2020 in the struggle between Trumps and Bidens.
The most important issues have been the crown and economics of the past – and the performance and history of the President in both categories.
Kanye West and his psychiatrists
Today, the musician Kanye West apologize for his wife, Kim Kardashian, asking for his pronunciation to fall into a prime case.
The president of Psychologists believes that he is taking his creative power into psychology, but a psychologist says importantly that people are taking medicines to keep the disease under control.
The Rape Kanye West is not only one of the prime and most powerful musicians at the same time, but he is not even famous as a man of the realistic star Kim Cardashian.
His personal life has been a great deal in front of open tents.
It brought great attention to him when he announced earlier this month that he was delighted to offer himself to President in the United States, and he held a emotionally obsessed talk.
Later, a few of his special tensions appeared on Twitter, saying that his wife was trying to put him into a hospital.
Kim Kardashian later published a statement on Instagram, as she asked people to show understanding to her husband and family; he had psychiatric illness, and it would be difficult for his loved ones to help him if he did not want to seek his own help.
Then he has apologize to her publicly.
This famous family is not the only one to deal with this problem.
It is estimated that about one percent of people have psychiatric disorders.
Ferdinand Johnsson is a supermedical psychiatrist in London, and he knows the disease well.
“ This disease can cause such an incredible distress for individuals, especially for the families and their loved ones.
This magnificent, or maniac, can destroy relationships and work and cause incredible grief.
And then the other sides, depression, it is often dangerous, because there is a high incidence of suicide in that group.
So I loved her saying that.
And it's just human and human," says Ferdinand.
The son of Unnstein, president of Psychologists, has struggled with psychology itself — and is a fan of Kanye West: “He seems to have a very violent imaginational power.
If we are four strings of earthly counterbass, he is a hundred strings of heavenly harp.
And he is so obscenely creative, excessively powerful, and smart in his powerful relationship thinking, because you will be with this connection thought that we have had to try to go into a prosperous state so well knows."
Kanye West doesn't want to take psychiatric drugs, because he thinks they're dragging out of his creativity.
He has been discussing the psychiatrists, including the Ye plate.
Yet, it is his choice not to take medicines.
“ Many people feel that this creative element is incorporated into this unhasty connection thought and overwhelming creative power of the fire that it has, but so naturally, the defects of this are often great suffering, and the aldus and darks of cellars and darkness. ”
On the other hand, Ferdinand says importantly that people with psychiatric disorders are treated.
“ If you have a lot of excellence or mania, you are not making great things, then you are just on the side.
And as when people go into severe depression, then people are completely paralyzed by that condition," he says.
So you would advise Kanye West to take medicines?
"Definitely," says Ferdinand.
“ And especially to work with someone to find the right doses and this way to make a balance between the medicines to help him as much as possible, and to destroy as he and his abilities and his creative power. ”

"Personal Disease" ambassador wants a gun, a car and a car injected - said the subscribers are the architect of the "deep kingdom"
A political ambassador of the United States here in the country, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, is said to want to carry a gun on him in the news of CBS today.
Said CBS: “Despite being placed in one of the most secure kingdoms of the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter is “sick ” about his security since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
Indicates CBS in 12 diplomatics, governmental agents, and former representatives, in addition to individuals who know about the matter.
Gunter’s conclusion was to demand from the U.S. Department that they wish the ambassador’s authorization to go through armed in this country.
He should also have desired a car that traveled between the locations in Iceland and the injection west.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to express whether there was a threat to the security of the ambassador, but representatives of the U.S. government said that the ambassador had been declared that Iceland was a safe country and that he was safe here.
Yet, the CBS said that lifeguards had been announced in Icelandic magazines, and if they were able to meet the ambassador’s requirements.
The newspaper CBS notes that the Icelandic Foreign Ministry did not want to comment on the matter with CBS.
However, according to its sources, the U.S. newspaper has said that no wish has been given to the national governments.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter was spoken by being armed because it would injure the host country, Iceland.
The Senator’s Majesty was paid for a great deal of support to the Donald Trump elections in 2016.

All of them had tried diploms from the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.

The next one disappeared for only six months.
Afterward, people were rooted and thought to let Gunter point as most people until he looked at one of them.
In addition, CBS says that Gunter had married the embassy staff to go to the field of the “deep kingdom” and to have buried off him against the Foreign Ministry of Washington D.C.
The Heads of the Foreign Ministry of D.C. are well conscious of the situation in their offices in Reykjavík, but have been hesitant to intervene in the statelessness of the Missionary in the light of Gunter’s relationship with the White House.
It is also said that Gunter had difficulty following the commands of the Foreign Ministry in Washington and, as he said, refused to return to the D.C. while the Covid-19 passes were suspended.
He left the post office in the hands of his employees for several months.
As he said, he was intended to work from his home in California except to be ordered by the foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, to return.
Snippet backwards
Finally, the owner received the order, turning Gunter back to Iceland in May.
His new underman, Michelle Yerkin, came to the country this month.
CBS has not received answers to their requests to the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not want to communicate with the CBS, nor with the question of DV.
Gunter is one of the many political organized ambassadors of the Trump Government, who has been paying attention to unusual behavior in the past months.
To form, Woody Johnson reacted hard when the day came that he was trying to move the British Master’s Congress in golf at the Gulf Valley of Trump.
The South African Senator has also ordered his number two and then tried to order her son to work.

Scientists have made a collection analysis of a coronary disease of over fifty decades.
The main signs of coronary arterial disease (also called cardiovascular disorder) are three: chest pain (arrhythmia), heart attack and heart failure.
Other symptoms of disease may be heart rhythm and high shortness of breath.
“Sucolate contains nutrients that are good for the heart, such as flavonoids, methylxantine, polyphenol and steric acid, which may reduce inflammation and increase good cholesterol."
Good cholesterol, also called high concentration fat protein, collects “slow” cholesterol – a type of cholesterol that tries the arteries of the heart – and moves it into the liver.
The “slow” cholesterol (low concentration fitoprotein) is broken down in the liver and then discontinued from the body.
However, the new study is unable to use doses or type of chocolate.
It is not clear whether participants ate dark chocolate, lactating chocolate, or other cookie guitars.
The results were based on an older study that concluded that the intake of cocoa (in chocolate) decreased the risk of heart attack.
Scientists believe that flavonoids found in chocolate reduce blood pressure and improve vascular function.
Vascular function means how well the blood distributes oxygen and nutrients to the body and disposes of waste.
No life-style factors were found in the results of the new study.
Dr. Alice Lichtenstein said that those who had acknowledged eating chocolate would be more likely to have a healthy body weight.
She added that they could regularly exercise physical training and feel less stressed.
“Every of these factors may have an independent effect on the health of the cardiovascular system,” she added.
Coles switches plastic to books in a new collection reporting campaign
“ We have really listened, and it was a complete key element in the preparation of a project, ” said Ronson.
“We do not believe that people want to rebuild the books – we think they will have them, but they can recover them at home if they want.”
Ronson said that the new presentation campaign has been working long before COVID-19 arrived in history and, despite the epidemic, it believes that the time of the new campaign has been “nothing good” because of the amount of time parents spend with their children now.
Articles have expressed concerns because consumers have become tired in the constant gambling campaigns of the largest markets, but Ronson says no signs of tiredness yet.
"We haven't seen anything like this yet, but we have our eyes constantly open to this," she said.
“ We report a lot of data, from week to week, month to month, to ensure that what we make from us feel is consistent with our clients.
It was Cloes who ran the path for collection campaigns like Little Shop, Australia, but the first of my year 2018 was the drive force behind the best quarter of the major market sales from the beginning.
Woolworth followed with Lion King Oosheis, who also helped large markets to increase their sales, and now the last offer the environmental presentation campaign Discovery Garden customers on free plants and flowers for planting.
However, this time the new collection strategy could have a lower impact, since the UBS analyses foretell increased sales in larger countries in Australia in the largest part of the financial year 2021.
Ronson said that clients could expect a multitude of collection campaigns in the future and that military trips such as Little Shop are likely to be more rare.
“ There is a lot about collective recruitment campaigns around the world that we look at and we are constantly inspired from other countries, ” she said.
“We need to do so to ensure that we do more and more with our clients.”
Five rings around the country in summer
The photographer and material manufacturer John Ragnar Johnsson, often known as Jon From Iceland, have been more and less in the area of Iceland since the world epidemic.
A few years ago, John completed a basic business study at the University of Reykjavík, but now work on traveling and producing market materials for individuals and businesses.
The summer began early with John, or April, when he traveled throughout the West River and stayed in his car.
What is over a year, he's gone about five or six circles around the country.
In addition, he has gone to countless day trips here and there.
What trip has happened?
“ For someone like me who is always on the spot and has seen everything, it’s hard to mention a favorite place.
It is more weather and society that matters.
Recently, after the opening of the roads in June, there has been a high level of landing.
These trips always stand up because it is so much adventure to get to the destination.
The last trip there is the possible favorite journey of the year, but then 25 of us went up on five large cars at the river side and from there to the Elfwater."
What's ahead of you last summer?
“ I am very exciting next time, but I was just finishing a high - time study with DIVE and now taking a headquarters around Iceland.
Then I was adding brimbret to the "dotakass" with me, so I'll be more out in the sea than before.
I'm then going on a 10-day “solo” ride with everything I need my back, but it'll come to light later in the summer where I go.
Otherwise I'll be very high in the nearest country where it is not possible to look at that area all year."
What place in Iceland is in favour of you?
“ Always find it difficult to choose one place, but the Jökulsarlon has been a part of my life since I remember.
Every summer, my family and I went to a place near the roots of the Great Mark, and then I have always felt well in that area.
I think I'm safe to say I've come there over 100 times."
What place in Iceland do you recommend that people visit?
“ I’m going to bring one pearl from each country, but that’s: Moelags in the south, the Eastern, the Aldeyarfoss in the north, the Red Age in the West, the Snow - Pearl in the West, and the last, but not the last...
What is vital in the journey?
“ I’m not going out to land unless I have the following in the car: Good vase light, hanging room, lopa peysa, hunting knife, cubbers, refrigerators, and cubits... those who know me know what I’m talking about. ”
Looking for 24 rests that fear drunk from a island in Malaise
COALA LUMPUR, Malaise (AP) — The authorities in Malasia said on Sunday that it was sought that 25 rohine refugees who were afraid to have been drunk after hoping out of boats from the traveler island of Langkawi, north of Malawi.
Zawawi Abdullah, a senior official of Malasia’s local security, said that the first information of the police revealed that only one of the 25 rohinists who had taken the boat would have swimed to the country.
According to Zawawi, the man who died was looking for help at the police late Saturday and has been held while the matter was examined.
Hundreds of thousands of Muslim rohines have fled Mjanmar because of military operations, and many of them live in overwhelming refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Muslims are the majority of Malasia’s inhabitants, who have been frequently targeted by a boat member who promises refugees better life in another country.
Zawawi said that two ships and airs were used to search.
He said that the land - shelter will also keep the seafarers in the area and the authorities of the neighbouring country of Tailandi in order to help with their search.
He didn't give more information about the boat.
In the last month, the authorities in Malasia took 269 robin refugees to guard and found a deadline on a boat that suspects that had been used to smuggle from the beaches of Langkawi, but they claimed that he had been injured in order to avoid returning to the sea.
Later, Malachi’s land - sanctuary said that the 269 individuals had been transferred from a larger ship with many people who were supposed to have died and that their bodies were floated into the sea.
The Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that Malazia could not accept any more rohine refugees, as they face economic problems due to the crown virus epidemic.
On the other hand, he said that those already in the country would not return to the sea.
In Malasia, more than 2 million illegal immigrants live in addition to about 180,000 refugees and refugees — including 10000 rows — recorded by the United Nations Refugee Agency.
Inhabitants of Aswan gather, watch and return a farm of chocolate to Sudan after cargo
On Sunday, there are many tons of chocolate on the international road between Aswan and Abu Simple, at the gateway near the village of Wadi Karkar, when the driver died because of a temperature.
Inhabitants grouped to help the driver, where he was lying and rescuing the goods that had caused.
One of them, Alaa Bahr, described his position so that the driver was “going by our village; we could not just stay by.
We should help people in distress, no matter where they come from."
He added that villagers had come to an ambulance to pick up the driver and then tried to save the carriage of the carriage, estimated on three million Egyptian pounds.
Bahr said that villagers have been in the area from morning to evening and saved as much of the farm as they could.
“ The most important thing we felt was to save the driver’s life, protect the ship and reopen the international road, ” he said.
The villagers were willing to provide the damaged drivers with water and a shelter, said Bahr, adding that they just wanted him to come safely from the village.
There were already brotalams at the conference, which could make them worse.
“ The history alone is called to our elected representatives for the leadership and vision we are expecting at times of difficulty, ” says a report that was developed from a interview series held by Leonard Steinhorn, a professor of communication at the American University, and Mark Sobol, author and expert in organisational development and governance.
“ But we are also faced with other debts relating to our nation’s inheritance sins and the racial disregard that has struggled our country from its establishment. ”
The study covers familiar substances related to the delicate state of the Assembly: lack of real relations between classes, program that limits the opportunity to communicate, excess co-operation of powers in leaders positions, constant demands for funds, discounts of cooperation between classes, negative effects of media operating throughout the day, the fact that the most important elections for seniors are often pre-decisions and finally silence of minority groups.
It is also warned that the conference will move more into the world because of the world’s terror, where such a system that permits votes by means of representatives without having to travel to Washington could still increase the problems that exist.
If the concept of a remote meeting approaches, it would be a serious reaction to attempts to increase communication between classes, as stated in the report.
“For the sake of the history of the world, the conference was forced to transfer most of its activities to the Internet, and we certainly understand why,” says the report.
“ But even though it was necessary, such things should not be interpreted as virtue. ”
The document states that the session needs “more than less communication between senators, face to face. ”
They need to know each other’s districts more closely, have polite conversations to find a common fleet and build a link based on trust that can lead to greater understanding and solutions."
The call for courtesy was particularly relevant during the week, when Ted Yoho, the Senator of the Republic of Florida, attacked Alexandriu Ocasio-Cortez, Senator Demokrate from New York, with advocates and his companions in the Rebumberna class, agreed to attack Liz Cheney, the Senator of the Republic of Wyoming, with hostile words.
The Senator Val Demings talks about the President-in-Office, Trump lets it hear for the merits.
The council of Val Demings (Democrates, Florida) was not embarrassed to discuss her interest in the office of the President of the Reserve in the possible government of Joe Biden and expressing sincere appreciation for being taken into account for the office.
This respected member of the group of blacks was interviewed with BlackPressUSA in a direct broadcast because of the #FIYAH! Live theme and told about her history, laboratory and commitment, which has brought her to the place she is present today, and began with the words “You know all my story. I grew up as a daughter of a worker and householder in Jacksonville, Florida.”
Demings was one of the four prosecutors of the Assembly in the court courts of Donald Trump in January.
Regardless of whether the elders infect Trump, it will be recorded in the history that he is the fourth accused president.
In a interview with the NPR of his office at Capitol Hill, the former prosecutor of the Assembly, said: “Is this worth it, and this has been worth it every day. ”
She added that despite the disappointment of the decision, democratics were obliged to follow the matter according to their outcome.
In the interview, Demings made clear that she was against Trump’s imprisonment sentence of Roger Stone, who was sentenced to lie before the Assembly (also other crimes) as and his achievement of other criminals who were sentenced to a similar crime, when she said: “The insidience of your friends, those who have been lying and deceived to cover your wrongdoing. ”
Deamings is the top of Joe Biden’s list of possible prosecutors to the President of the Reserve, which also stores Karen Bass foreman CBC (Demokrates, California), Stacey Abram’s former Senator of Georgia, the Chairman of Camöla Harris (Democrates, California) and Tammy Duckworth (Democrates, Illinois), Keisha Lance Bottom’s Citizen of Atlanta, Susan Rice former President of the United States, and some others.
On the other hand, she stated that only one person would decide who would make a job with Joe Biden in the autumn.
"It's Joe Biden."
Then she brought her hand to the mouth while she laughed and felt whispered at those who looked at the direct broadcast, adding: “If you want to call... you can do it for me. ”
There is no doubt that regardless of the political views of each one will be viewed in the history books of this period as a time when the development of American politics and attitudes became.
This didn't happen to Demings.
It pointed out that the number of women present to the United States President of the Resurrection of the United States is the opportunity to break through the remainder of the “glass roof” – especially for women of African origin.
“ It’s exactly these opportunities that I work so hard that I’m all my life to create for young boys and girls who have heard their colors are wrong, that they don’t have enough money or that they are of wrong sex, ” she said.
The Senator decided to ensure that the Democratic Group’s Committee and the Biden Councils would advertise and work with Black Press of America to get as many as possible to choose.
“ I will call Tom Perez (the leader of the Democratic Group’s Committee) and I will put it at the top of my list," Demos promised Demings.
She agreed that this would have to happen now rather than later in the election struggle.
When she answered the words of former foreign minister Hillary Clinton that Trump could refuse to leave the White House, he would lose his elections, and another editorial that says that the President is preparing for himself, lived over Demings: “As much as it goes up to reach himself, I was unhappy. ”
“ But who would ever do so other than Trump?
I think he hates this job.
It should not be possible to escape the breaking of laws and to ignore the regime in this work.
I think he hates the job, but he doesn't endure to lose.
I can quite believe that the President will not want to leave the White House, but we have our ways to take care of it, and if that happens, I just want to be with those who let it happen."

Gurugram, July 26: The company Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, have been addressed to the court in Gurugram after the former employee of the company claimed that he had been expelled for protesting writing and false news in the company’s programs.
The case is set out in Gurugram District Court, and Sonia Sheokand, a private court, has issued a policy for Alibaba, Jack Ma and more than 10 others, and they are invited to come to court on July 29, according to news.
The judge has also requested written replies from the company, according to Reuters.

“We stand with the company's commitment to the Indian market and its welfare of employees, and its approach is in line with applicable laws.
We can't communicate about the current case process," said the UC India in a statement.

Last month, the National Ministry banned 59 Chinese mobile programs, including UC News and UC Browser, in line with increased tension between the two countries.
Representative of the New York City's fireplace says it's 'complete' all right to exclude a white fireman from the honourable price.
A representative who deals with the matter of diversity in the city of New York says that it is "completely" in order to keep a white fireman from the honourable price so that all of us can be black, according to a new news.
The white fireman Daniel McWilliams has raised a matter of discrimination by race after he was taken from a group of flagberries at the Memorial Mesh in November 2017 to remember the fallen members of the Vulcan Society, a brotherhood of black firequakes.
The main representative of the fireplace in the field of diversity and accessibility, lawyer Cecilia Loving, also made the decision in the hearing of the New York State of Human Rights according to the New York Post.
McWilliams is one of the three firefighters of the Division, which can be seen in a historical picture lifting the U.S. flags at Ground Zero in the days of the attacks of September 11.
According to McWilliam’s dear friend, he had chosen to be alone for the flagkeeper’s honor of the memorial.
To be a flagkeeper of this act was “great honor and privilege” for McWilliam, as stated in the CNN Law.
However, when he came to the operation, he was meant to participate in the honorary prize of the then president of the Vulcan Society, Regina Wilson, because as it was claimed, she had asked that all the flagrants would be black.
She then asked McWilliams, a 29 - year - old laborer of the New York City, to help another way."
Among what is claimed that she asked him to do is to give unchanged citizens follow and set up uniquely dressed firefuckers from the fair.
McWilliams claimed in his lawyer that he asked Wilson if she was taking him out of the Honor because he wasn't black.
She confirmed that it was, he said.
Wilson, who has been working with the New York City fireplace for 21 years and who has also participated in the rescue work in September 11, will have replaced McWilliams to one of the Vulcan Society members.
McWilliams claims that he left the memorial act “to protect himself from further shame, humiliation, and shame, ” when friends and cooperatives heard what happened between them, according to the New York Daily News.
When Loving, a black, witnessed to court, she asked her lawyer, McWilliams, Keith Sullivan,: “So it is not a difference to pray that everyone is black in honor? ”
"No, that's not," said Loving, according to the New York Post.
Sullivan also asked Loving if it would be okay to pray that everyone would be black in honor, as she replied: “Fullly. ”
Loving explained that it would be okay to share a white person with a black person in order to “high up our specialty and different origins to create pride, consistency, and support for each other. ”
McWilliams first filed a claim on discrimination from races in the New York City fireplace in January 2018.
He then appealed against Wilson, New York City, New York City, and unnamed persons in May 2019.
Sullivan said that after McWilliam’s speech, Wilson’s supporters had revenged and threatened him.
At one point, one of her supporters will have put her hands on McWilliams and said: “I have heard of you, they told me that you would be like that, and now you know who I am. ”
In the outdoor, Sullivan wrote that it would have been “fabulous” to exclude McWilliams from the honorary to the fair, and indicate that one was not applicable to all of the fireplace.
“If you are a black person and different white person at the workplace, you are mostly reminded,” Sullivan said.
According to the law, Wilson received “advice for one hour” due to her treatment of McWilliam.
In the meantime, a white person who differs from a black person receives “great punishment, ” wrote Sullivan.
“The New York City has created a policy and a process that is intended to please the members of the Vulcan society, who act in a racial way, apologize for their actions and assist them ... and this has to stop," Sullivan also wrote.

Thousands of Khabarovsk inhabitants still require a resignation of Puerto
Thousands of citymen joined the Russian city of Khabarovsk last night and protested arrest of the district manager in the co-committed region south of Eastern Russia and the establishment of his inheritances, who have never lived in the region.
The former Commander, Sergei Furgal, enjoyed great popularity and tens of thousands of inhabitants protested when he was arrested and brought to guard in Moscow earlier this month, accused of ordering the murder of three businessmen for fifteen years ago.
During the last week, Furgal was formally appointed as a governor, and his 39 - year - old brother, Mikhail Degtyarev, was appointed in his place, at the small love of the locals.
When Degtaryev is said unreasonable and, worse, without any contact with Khabarovsk and called the inhabitants for his reputation the fastest.
Their calls have made Degtaryev a wind of ears.
Last night, the protesters were smaller than in the first protests, or fifteen to twenty thousand, and the demands were the same as before: the liberation of Furgal, and the resignation of Vladimir, President of Pútin, Russia.
“We want the Commander to be released, because we think his arrest is very likely to be illegal," the AFP newspaper has after a Protestant, Alina Slepovu, half thirty.
She claims that Kremlars arrested Furgal “to defend their own interests, but not the interests of the region. ”
In Khabarovsk, the police made protesters unfair, despite the uncertainly breach of the demand of the local meeting ban on the Cyrus virus.
In Moscow, however, the police arrested at least ten people who met at the Pusjkin Tower to show support to Protestants in Khabarovsk, says the newspaper of the British magazine Guardian.
The group of Furgals, Russia's Freedom of Democracy, is a group of hardline nationalists, and is considered to be a little loyal to the Cremlar government in most cases.
However, the same political reporters inform BBC that the victory of Furgal in the two years ago — great and indispensable — had been a significant shock for Puerto and the United Kingdom, and although it suggests that Cremlars in the eastern part of the world were weakening.
Furgal was arrested on July 9, and moved to Moscow, where he is waiting for judgment.
He is accused of ordering three murders during 2004 and 2005.
Two of them were done, but the third went out by the dust.
Sarah Rainsford, newspaper BBC in Moscow, says Furgal’s followers, who enjoy greatly popular homes, convinced that the accusation and arrest have political roots.
They want to know why governments have been waiting for him to be arrested until now, says Rainsford, 15 years after his wrongdoing.

And there are more women like Shanthi who stay in the city's gistyl for women with disabilities and put the fight against Covid-19 teams.

When Manimekaai is asked what she does, she says: “I use a mask, keep a distance, and I often wash my hands.
I also drink Kabasura Kudineer, a sittha drink that enhances the immune system."

Aishwarya Rao, physician and the director of the gistyl, who and the Dorcas study station that runs the shelter, says: “They are adjusting to the needs of each hour.
Before they needed masks, they didn't leave them.
Now they came into the community, and then they answered the call."

South Africa: Ashwell Prince and Marsha Cox tell about their experience of differentiation
The last few weeks have seen that there are still many bones in the cabinet in relation to race law in sports in South Africa.
Constructive conversations need to be conducted, and action is needed to ensure that everyone is welcomed in sports.
Ashwell Prince, the former Crown Star of Proteas, told his former white companions to hear it and accused them of racial prejudice by saying that he and other black officers were “people players. ”
Prince said the black players of Proteas have been officially called "cott players" by their white teams.
He added that it was sad that even if black players like Makhaya Ntini and now Kagiso Rabada had the highest metrics in sports, some people were still connected to the quitting talk.
Prince, who is now the trainer of the Cape Cobras team, made this statement fall at the United Coalition for Sport and Community Based Organisations (UCSCBO) website on Thursday evening.
The organization’s goal is to continue the ambiguous discussion of historical race law in South Africa’s sports.

"You're doing everything right, but you're infected anyway"
Paul Roberts, former musician and craftsman at NASA, is now working with a software company.
He and his wife, former nurse at the Metodist hospital, who viewed herself as an optimistic man, held out an interesting magazine on the Internet and attended Comic Con events earlier a year ago.
Once a week, they are hoping with two of their daughters, son-in-laws, and a 7-year-old child, and playing a lot of Uno games.
“ They are incredible north, ” says Roman, 38 years old, about his parents.
Sheryl Roberts, 65 years old, is aware of the dangers of the world’s epidemic — diabetes, asthma, and heart disease that may risk it.
Her husband has a chronic pulmonary disease and a stomach, which predominantly opens up a cranial.
“We have gone so careful, very careful, and stay away from people,” said Sheryl Roberts.
Her husband started working at home in spring, when the carriage struggled hard on Washington, New York and other areas around the country.
Paul has occasionally gone to a large market during the “old men’s time” and the only real meeting of their last month was, according to Sheryl, when they began to look through the wildflower through the car window.
Their younger daughter also went with caution.
But then she came home from work one day in mid - June and thought she had allergies.
She soon received cough, fever, headache and diarrhoea, and lost all taste and smell, which are typical symptoms of the crown virus.
“ She said, “I don’t know what’s going on, Mom, but I had a mask, had a glove, washed my hands, ” said Sheryl.
“ You do everything right, but you are infected anyway. ”
Elaine Roberts, diagnosed with a positive crown virus, did not become seriously ill.

The former royal couple felt that it was “hunsed” in the Queen's Christmas talk, according to a new book
MEGHAN Markle and Harry Bretaprins found his grandmother, the British Queen, “hunsed” them in their Christmas talk.
The new life story of the couple, “Finding Freedom, ” shows that they were overlooked by those in the gallery that could be seen in the Christmas talk.
Pictures on the table that the queen was sitting at showed, among other things, the Willhelm of the British Prince, Kate Middleton, and their three children, Karl Bretaprins and his wife Kamilla as well as Prince Philip.
But Meghan and Harry weren’t seeing anything, despite the fact that Archie had been born in May, but the boy was mentioned as “the grandchildren of her Majesty. ”
The new book, which comes out in August, also shows that Meghan and Kate Middleton were “never friends” because they“ made it difficult to overcome superficial kindness ” and met only several times.
Yesterday, therefore, it was claimed that Harry and Willhim’s brother’s dismissal began some years before his relationship with Meghan but reached a maximum for Willhim and Kate Middleton’s marriage.
The Duchess of Sussex felt that he was a “warsaver ” of events with his brother and Kate Middleton, saying that“ he wanted to change things long before Meghan arrived in history. ”
Senators of the Interpretation Group are accused of the leaders of the labour force to want to keep officials “the world forever”.
Senators of the Interpretation Group accused of the worker's wish to want officials to “reside forever” after the leaders protested Boris Johnson's call for people to return to work.
The officers were accused of wanting the staff to “speak forever at home” after they protested Boris Johnson's calls for people to return to work.
The Senators of the Interpretation Group rebelled when the Public and Public Workers Society told their companions to ask their feet when their superiors ordered them to return to their workplaces.
Andrew Percy, former Prime Minister, said it was “unacceptable” that necessary public service as if the version of passports would be stopped while employees in the general market had worked hard to keep society running in the crown virus epidemic.
“ It is unacceptable that people refuse to return to their work while workers in warehouses and plants throughout the country have continued to work so that officials can eat during this time, ” he said.
“ Many of these employees now want to go on a summer vacation, but they cannot be able to go back to their workplaces because of the people who refuse to go back to their workplace, although they are safe.
Officers cannot maintain this way of staying at home forever – especially not now when we know that people can return to work in a safe way."
After the call of a presidency minister last week, Alex Chisholm, a new corporate manager of official service, announced that a minister would “high away from working officials from home to work and hurry their return to workplaces until August 1st. ”
The Public and Public Worker People’s Association announced their companions, who counted about 200,000 people, that they would not have to comply with this requirement, and said that this was about politics.
A spokesman of the Public and Public Workers Society, the largest public trade unions in Britain, said that the requirement to return to work would not be “produced by the health and safety of our companions in advance, or to strengthen the economy.
This is done solely because of political pressure from the Senators of the Interpretation Group, which calls for public service to be used as an example to get others back to work.
Our recommendations to fellow workers are clear: If you do your homework and someone in your department asks you to come back to the workplace, do not take it as of course that you need to do so."
The dispute may result in growing discomfort with delayed passports because of the work at home, but some 400,000 people are now told to wait for their application.
The Ministry of the Intergovernmental Affairs has now announced that it will be “affordable to speed up” requests from the UK because of travelling over the next two weeks, and from those who have waited for a passport for more than four weeks.
The Public and Public Workers' Association has acknowledged that some have had to wait up to 143 days after passports, but claims that “small and often narrow offices” make the 4000 staff of the passport service difficult to keep the necessary distance.
The former Minister of the Government, David Davis, urged the leaders of the trade union to “successful” and seek to cooperate with governments to bring people back into their workplaces.
He added that if he was in a government, he would ask the captain of the worker: “What are you doing, that people should be at home all summers? ”
However, some of the largest British companies have ignored Johnson’s order to return to work.
A study in larger jobs with a total of 400,000 employees revealed that only about 40 000 of them have returned to their workplaces.
The focus on history may be important for satisfaction
Gyes have increased, but understanding and consensus should be the goal.
The school system is partly responsible for this knowledge and understanding card.
Too little is taught by Australian history.
The fact is that without a radical operation, the only teaching article that specially deals with our history – "Saga Australia" for 12th class – will die out within the next five years or even earlier.
In the last year, only 628 students in the Kingdom of Viktoria graduated in the history of Australia of a total of 49,324 graduates, or only 1%.
Over the past six years, this number has almost decreased by half, but nearly 100 less students are recorded each year.
The main reason why so few students choose to learn about Australia’s 12th class history is that little has been done in the past years to raise their interest.
History is not even a unique field of study, but is covered by the more widespread “consensus. ”
Therefore, students in the 7th and 8th class only complete one short unit on “the inhabited and the island of Torres and their culture. ”
In the 9th and 10th year, there is another unity on Australia during the world wars.
For many students in Viktoria, this is all that is taught about Australia’s history during the primary school years.
In the 9th and 10th year, another optional unit for the period 1750-1918.
It is important to take three actions to save the Australian history in the schools of the Kingdom of Victory.
First, history needs to become an independent study article, such as English, mathematics, and science.
Since history is only educated as part of the senses, it has little space in the study program.
It is usually instructed by people who have general education in the field of intelligence but have not learned in history.
Historic performance, such as the analysis of information, is complex.
We need to advise more special historian teachers to ensure that such skills are taught in an accessible and exciting way.
Third, Australia’s history must become an obligatory article from 1788 to 1914.
Students appreciate what they know.
So many of my former students did not choose to learn Australia’s history during the 12th study year, for they would have had to learn the material from the foundation.
Knowledge of history alone does not show a deep gap between races.
But without it, as can be seen in Victory’s study book, the task is hopeless.

Aron Elis in the final game of Europe - Isaki divided from a velocity to a half game
Aron Elis Trándarson is in a final game about Europe in the Danish election department in football.
Isaac Bergmann Johannesson played only the first half game with the top of Norrköping against Falkenberg’s base in Sweden.
Aron Elis was a member of the OB in Denmark when the team continued to play a final play in the precursorship of the European Department.
OB will meet AGF or FC Köbenhavn in the final game, but it depends on whether the joints end up after the end of the top of the Danish election section later today.
Aron Elis played the whole game in a 1-1 parallel to Horsens on the field today, but OB had won the first game of the teams in the home field, 3–1, and thus earned a unique number of 4–2.
Isaac was in the beginning of the North Creation, which was unexpected 2 to 0 after the first half playing against Falkenberg's base in the Swedish election department.
At the beginning of the second half, Norrköping made a threefold division, and Isaac was one of those who needed to change.
Norrköping was equally evaluated, but Falkenberg arrived in 3 to 2 in 89 minutes.
However, it was still time for Norrköping to eliminate in the last hour, 3 to 3.
Norrköping continues on the top, with 24 points, four points ahead of Elfs City, and five points ahead of Malmö, which plays for good later today.
The hill of Falkenberg was able to get out of the bottom for a while, but the team is a step above the city of Helsing, and Calmar, who has a game for good.
Collects Tribunal Reports on Crown Virus Times
Anna Lilia Victory set up the Facebook group “My Nations Festival 2020” to collect the sources of the National Festival that the Eyjamen are going to celebrate for the next weekend.
Many are going to tent in their trees and rejoice with friends and relatives.
Anna Lilia talked to Hvata in the Helgin section on the Bylg.
“ There is nothing yet that is very exciting, too, because there are 600 people in the group so that they are clearly going to do something, ” says Anna Lilia.
Something is about the Eyes are going to have tents at home in a park.
“ People have spoken of being with their own [feast], perhaps tent in the park, and threatening the family as they always do at this time, ” says Anna.
“ A man expects to spend time with his people.
However, it is likely that many people are not going to be in the place, “but yet to hold a small national celebration somewhere else. ”
The National Festival Committee is now working hard on reimbursing the notes purchased, but Anna believes that many residents are rather going to guarantee their attention to the next year’s celebration.
“They are even investing in the centres and being valid for 2021.”
“ I am a great People of Nations, I love the preparation and all around this, but sometimes something comes into life that you do not control, and then it is just like that, ” says Anna, but accordingly there has been something that people have asked whether the Eyahs can’t release the National Festival “thought once. ”
Anna Lilia claims not to have set up the group for himself or to encourage people to hold their own National Festival, but to gather sources of commercial celebrations in the Eyes this year.
“ What did people do in these weird times?
I'm not going to use this in something or anything but then come to figure out someone who uses such permissions in something but I was just creating some area where people can put in what it's doing."
There is also a burning of the Fireworks that is turned on each year.
“ I think many are excited to get burned on Friday night.
The only thing that, of course, makes a step in the account is that the prophecy isn't a spice."
“There will be a fire in this burn, but it must only be revealed how it will be,” says Anna Lilia.

Will Prince Andrew be mentioned in new cases of sexual abuse?
The British royal family now prepares for reaction to possible new information in legal documents on his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
A U.S. Judge has ordered that secret documents on Epstein and Maxwell be made public
Among those found in these 80 pages of documents, parts with a witness from the year 2016 Maxwell
The display of these pages could also put great pressure on Prince Andrés, where there is a communication between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015
Virginia Roberts, the sexual slave of the shameful American financialman, claimed in 2015 in court that she had been forced to have agreement with Prince Andreas.
Prins Andreas now prepares himself to defend the possible publication of information during the week with the even more harmful accusations of his friendship with the child assassin Jeffrey Epstein and his intimidated coward, Ghislaine Maxwell.
The U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered the week for the publication of 80 secret legal documents related to Maxwell and Epstein, who count hundreds of pages.
The displaying of these vastly extensive documents would be a shock for the 58-year-old Maxwell, where they have a large part with its witnessing before lawyers in 2016, including what her lawyers have said to be “available questions” about her sexual history.
They could also put great pressure on prince Andrés, where one of the documents contains communications between Maxwell and Epstein from January 2015, when Virginia Roberts, the sexual slave of the shamed American financialman, claimed in 2015 that she had been forced three times to have contact with Andrew.
Andrés repeatedly rejected these statements.
A computer mail from 2015 that has been released and BBC published last year appears to indicate that Andrew asked Maxwell to respond to Robert’s claims.
We have no doubt that the Duke will be rebelled
There he said to the chief lady: “Let me know when we can talk, with certain questions I need to ask you about Virginia Roberts. ”
Maxwell replied: “You have information, call me when you have a free time. ”
Last night, a writer near Andrew said: “The Lord of Jorvík has done nothing wrong, so we are not worried about the opening of courts.
As courts in the United States have tried to point to them, this does not mean that a accusation is true even if it appears in court documents.
American courts have encouraged media and publicity to take care of the most precautionary treatment of the causes of court documents.
We totally agree.
We have no doubt that the Duchess will have a full rebellion in the next weeks."
Maxwell is now in the Manhattan Maintenance Centre and is waiting for courts to find and deprive some of Epstein’s victims under law age from 1994 to 1997.
It is also accused of an insult because it refuses knowledge of his abuse report.
She's rejecting all the accusations.
Maxwell last talked to lawyers in April and July 2016 in connection with Robert’s Mortality Head, who are now under the surname of Giuffre, which she recorded after marriage.
Some 40 counts of a total of 418 were made public in the last year, but after the decision of the Judge Presna in New York last week, several parts could be opened first on Thursday.
Maxwell’s lawyers had one week to make a suggestion.
Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in New York last year when he was waiting for courtship for sexual violation.
Research Police seeks a crime scene for violent attack on the streets of Edinburg
Three assaulted a man in Edinburg and hurt him who could prove to be lasting.
The 29 - year - old victim was attacked in Drum Street, Gilmerton, between 3:00 and 23:30 on Saturday.
The police in Scotland reported that he had been transferred to the royal hospital with serious injury.
The investigator Dale Miles, who is conducting the study, said: “This was a violent and unreasonable attack. ”
The suspects fled to Newtoft Street.
One of them was considered to be in the age of 40, about 180 cm high, and strongly grown.
He was cut short and dark in a white ball, dark pants, and dark shoes.
The police officer Miles said: “I pray all those in this area when the attack was made, and I saw something suspicious about giving up. ”
The messenger wants to carry a gun in Iceland
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the U.S. missionary in Iceland, wants a gun in this country and wants to increase security.
It has been said that he has been “sick” about his security since he arrived in the country last year.
This is seen in a CBS newspaper, which also states that this will Gunter, despite his work in “one of the most secure kingdoms of the world. ”
Gunter has been told to ask the U.S. Foreign Ministry to be obligated to the Icelandic government that he may carry a gun.
Then he has prayed for a car and a vest that resists his knife tongues.
However, CBS authors have repeatedly announced Gunter that he is not in danger in Iceland.
The newspaper CBS notes that Iceland’s Foreign Ministry did not provide information on whether a request from the United States had been submitted to Gunter for possible weapons, because the authorities did not communicate to foreign security measures.
The newspaper’s authors say that no request was submitted.
Then CBS also, after its authors had been told Gunter that he should not seek to carry weapons, so it would be taken as an offense in this country.
Gunter is an inexperienced physician in California for years.
He is active in the U.S. Reputation Group and active supporter Donald Trump, President.
He recently raised attention here in the country when he tested about the “invisible Chinese virus. ”
The CBS’s authors also say that Gunter had dealt with the U.S. Embassy in Reykjavík.
He had already had seven next council staff from May in the past.
He has, among other things, accused them of being part of the 'Deep Kingdom', so called to be the network of U.S. officials working against Trump, and was angry with the fact that one had snow in his office.
The Senator traveled to Washington DC in February for a conference and refused to return to Iceland for a few months, according to CBS.
Gunter is said to have wanted to work from California, but at the end, Mike Pompeo, the U.S. foreign minister, had to order him to return and do it in May.
The home game form is a key element for Jose Mourinho, which says Tottenham has easier moves in the future when adhesives get back to play
With the help of Jose Mourinho, Tottenham Hotspur has not lost a game in the home since the elections started again, but he says that it would be much easier to maintain a good walk at home if the audience had been released.
Spurs has won 12 victories at home during this playtime, but has lost four times — only one of the six joints above them has lost more in the home field.
The trainer Portuguese said that although such victory would be possible without the attendants, it would be easier to maintain it if they were there.
“We have to do this with the fans, and without them, some kind of activity can be built, where the playtable is in the forefront,” he said.
“ But I think it would be much more powerful to do with the fans, for then the emotional sides of the game, which will only be next with the help of admirers in the home scene. ”
Mourinho believes that with stronger rivals, it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the long periods of victory in a home area that he knows from Chelsea, or that Liverpool has built in the past three seasons.
However, this is also a key factor in determining whether the past reaches its goals at the end of the period, especially in equal games and neighborhood laws, where the atmosphere of the field can divide.
“ I believe that the course of the election department is that it is becoming more and more difficult now to strike these unlikely estimates, because what has been done well. ”
“ However, it is important to be strong in the home field and at the end of the theatre to have loaded a number of stages with victories in home games. ”
“ I am pleased with the finals of home games in the past, without the fans, but we need to get them back.
I see a victory against Arsenal with the ground full of Tottenham's winners.
This is compassion that is built up small and small."
Buyers excited for the desired lifestyle in Lovely Banks
'More is better' is obviously the motto of new owners of huge property in Lovely Banks, which was recently sold on 1270 Australian dollars.
Interesting purchasers in search of lifestyle property near the middle town of Geelong increased to look at this 1,35 hectares of land, where there is a car cover for 14 cars, swimming and viewing the Corio River.
Joe Grgic, a real estate sale in Harcourts, North-Geelong, said that the offer in the landing area that Cuddihy Court 1 had been approved within 10 days from the time she was placed on the market.
Broome Cottage in Ocean Grove again for sale
Selected home for isolation
“We received a number of bids from various parties,” said Grgic.
“The property was sold to a very excited householder.”
The property follows four rooms on two hills, including a special bathroom that is large enough to bed.
The new owners have a choice of three rooms and can use a kitchen and upgrade a area with a view to the swimming pool.
“ This was in how the property was composed, that she was three cars, and that she was in this place,” said Grgic.
“ Interesting merchants from Melbourne came here, wondering what the property was in the middle of the area, but still with a countryside.
“ I have people who have lost and buyers who are still looking for. ”
He said that the soft storage area, which includes a double garage and a free - standing shelter of 10 - 12 vehicles, was perfect for professionals or to store wheelchairs and trailers.
Counting its security threatened in Iceland
“ Despite being appointed as the safest country in the world, Jeffrey Ross Gunter has been patient for his safety since he arrived in Reykjavik last year. ”
This is how the CBS News starts a detailed discussion of the US ambassadors in Iceland, which simulates numerous CBS records from the U.S. foreign service.
In the CBS, Gunter claimed to request the U.S. Department for Foreign Affairs that he would be given a special license to the Irish authorities to carry weapons.
Then he should also have desired a car, in addition to the ideas of the West that could protect him from knife attacks.
The United States Foreign Ministry refused to publicly say whether Gunter’s safety is really threatened in Iceland, but according to officials’ information, Gunter has often been declared that he is in no particular danger.
Despite this, the U.S. Embassy in Iceland recently announced that it was done to suspend the concerns of Gunter.
The U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs does not express itself on the specific security measures associated with its embassy, but it always states the objective of preventive security.
The board does not answer questions relating to Gunter’s wish to be armed and the Icelandic Foreign Ministry would not indicate whether the United States had formally requested that the messenger could carry a gun and normally say that he would not express himself to security matters of foreign offices.
However, the CBS, following its Irish authors, has never been requested, and according to three U.S. officials, Gunter was given up of his plans, where they could be injured in Iceland.
The CBS also discusses the various problems that have been the anticipating United States Embassy in Iceland since Gunter was appointed ambassador last year, but he will already have redistributed his Reservoirs seven times.
In this way, it is said that the first reservoir has been preparing for a long time for his work and learned in English only to have been rejected at the last moment because Gunter ‘does not look at it’ at their first meeting.
His followers have not been much better under Gunter’s rule.
Directors of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs are said to be aware of the positions of the Icelandic Embassy, but they hesitate to intervene in a matter closely linked to the President.
Besides all this, Gunter is said to be insulted to comply with the different rules of the foreign service and to respect the rule of authority.
Gunter traveled to the United States in February to participate in a conference in Washington, and it was said that he refused to return to Iceland afterwards, leaving a temporary local member of his work for months, and so in the middle of the world.
Gunter would even have desired to do his job in a remote job and said that he would not return to Iceland unless the foreign minister, Mike Pompeo, wished to do so in particular.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Gunter had decided to take a personal permission to the Conference and the CRC warfare further delayed, but, according to CBS’s claims, many would have asked Gunter to return to Iceland, but he did not until May, after Pompeo had contacted him, and please asked him to return to the Icelandic Missionary.
The CBS also reports that Gunters in Iceland are inconsistent, especially in the context of tigers, where it calls the "invisible Chinese virus" and has been very critical.
Gunter is one multitude, almost unexperienced in the field of ambassadors who have been appointed during the government of President Donald Trump of the United States.
Sachin Pilot against Ashok Gehlot; the Bharatiya Janata Group says a government crisis; the Congress Group wants a vote
Ashok Gehlot said that if this was needed, the Congress Group would have to go to a office protest outside the home of a presidency minister.
On Saturday, a day after a peaceful conflict with Raj Bhawan, Jaipur, Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister Rajasthan, said that if this was needed, the Congress Group would need to meet the President and make a statement of office outside the presidency’s home to lead the crisis to smell.
At the Assembly meeting of the Congress Group, Gehlot indicated that it was planned to hold a vote to check whether the majority of the senators and co-operators were with him in the power struggle.
“ He said that the government had a majority and wanted to go to a vote, ” says Mahesh Joshi, the principal group of the Congress Group, after the meeting.
The Assembly meeting was held on a hotel where the congregators who support Gehlot have held their last days.
“ The Prime Minister asked us to be prepared to stay longer in the hotel.
If that was necessary, he said, he would meet the President and also hold peaceful protests outside the home of the Prime Minister," said a group leader.
On Friday, Mr Rajasthan may call the Assembly together and let the Congress Group show its majority, said the leader of the Group Rahul Gandhi, and indicated that the Bharatiya Janata Group had failed to cast up the State Government of Ashok Gehlot of the chair.
“ The country is now governed by law and regulation.
Governments are established and served by the public’s mandate.
Bharatiya Janata has been discovered in order to cast up a government of Rajasthan from the chair.
This is an offense against 80 million people of Rajasthan.
The Prime Minister must call together the council for the truth to come before the land," said Gandhi in the tisty of Hindi.
Ashok Gehlot, Prime Minister Rajasthan, said on Saturday to the Congress Group that he was ready to attend the meeting of the President of India to ensure that what he calls "Bharatiya Janata" in order to allow for a declaration of confidence with a vote will not be achieved.
Gehlot, who protested for hours at the home of the Governor of the State of Kalrai Mishra on Friday to take a meeting, met with the Congress Group and the State Government on Saturday, and after the meeting, new proposals were made and agreed by the Government.
Last night, Mishra asked Gehlot to return the Assembly request and pointed to six oppositions.
The event will soon be sent to a governor.
Gehlot has accused the governor of delaying for the Assembly meeting, where he is “under pressure” to delay for the voting fee that defers confidence in his government.
When Gehlot met its government, the Bharatiya Janata Mission Committee was headed by the leader of Satish Poonia and the leader of the Gulab Chandra Kataria with the Head of State to discuss the status of COVID-19 in the State.

Player Spencer Grammer given surgery outside the restaurant in Manhattan
NEW YORK — Player Spencer Grammar said that when he cut her on her arm, he cut her friend in her back outside a restaurant in New York City last Friday.
Grammer, who is 36 years old, said that she and her friend had done what everyone else had done in the same situation and that they were trying to prevent the situation from getting worse when they were attacked.

“ I don’t want to be like McGregor and show my money...
I'm here to help people" – Chimaev after a historic evening on UFC Fight Island – RT Sport News
The battle champion Khamzat Chimaev from Russia is now referred to as the next star of UFC after registering in the history of Fight Island, but he does not say that he is going to flag his riches in an extreme way like Conor McGregor.
Chimaev drew the North-Irian Rhys McKee in their battles in a chariot in Abu Dabi on Saturday night when he conquered his rival when three minutes and 9 seconds were over of the first cycle by letting the hit fall on him in the floor.
The victory recorded the name Chimaev in the history book UFC for the last time between the victory in the modern history of the race, since only 10 days had passed since he conquered the British John Phillips in a similar decisive way, then in an interim.
Chimaev, who has a victory ratio of 8-0, has received 50,000 American dollars for the performance of the evening against McKee and has taken the attention of the MMA world so fully that he is now called “Khalib 2.0”, which can be said to be an inevitable comparison because of the great gap between the superior Chimaev and the UFC master in light and where he is born in the nearby home-headed Khabib in Dagestan.
Despite newly found famous and financial benefits, the translated Chimaev has said that he would not like to flag his wealth like the MMA money machine Conor McGregor or his companion in the boxing world, Floyd Mayweather Jr.
“ I do this not just for myself, but for all I can help.
“ I don’t want to be like Mayweather and McGregor, show my money or something like that.
I want to help people," answered Chimaev when he was asked for it on Fight Island how he would use the bonus.
He has, among other things, raised the observation of Conor McGregor and the active Twitter-user Dillon Danis, who wrote to the community that he could “easyly” victory Chimaev with a survivor.
There was no toxic response from the fighter that is under the name “Borz, ” or“ wolf ” in his native language of the Czech, who said that he would “paint Danis with his eyes closed. ”
Chimaev, who is now living in Stockholm, Sweden, after having moved to the country 19 years old, may have little to do with his financial power, but he is obviously indispensable to flourishing his fighting forces.
“ I can paint anyone...
How many fighters are in the chariot department?
I can paint them all," he said.
"Give me some 77 kilos Master, 84 kilos Master (millivy), I paint them both, the same day."
Israelites continue to protest against the reactions of the Prime Minister to the world’s era
JERUSALEM (AP) — Thousands of Israel protested against the presidency in many parts of the country on Saturday, and were the greatest contradictions outside the official office of Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
The protests have been over for a few weeks, but they began because critics believe that the government’s neglect should respond to the crown virus epidemic after they initially succeeded in keeping the threat of the virus in progress.
The accusations of Netanyahu’s corruption have further led to the protest.
"Bibi, go home," stood on the sign of one of the Protestants.
On the second panel, “All see that the emperor has lost his clothes. ”
Also, hundreds of Protestants were gathered outside Netanyahu’s coastal house in the prosperous city of Caesarea.
Last week, the police used water guns to divide groups in Jerusalem.
Following what has been called rapid and unorganized reopening of economic life in May, the average number of new cases per day fell up to 2000.
The economy of the country has been injured due to the limitation of the virus and unemployment has increased by nearly 20%.
Protestants say that the government’s financial aid is not sufficient.
The protests took place in the shadow of the courts of corruption against Netanyahu, which began again in the month.
Discussions start in January.
He is accused of deceit, deceit, and misfortune in order of distress.

50 men's target in mosques at the Eid Festival and no prayer meetings in Eidgah, says the government of Karnataka
The Festival of Eid-ul-Azha, or Bakrid, occurs on 31 July and 1 August.
The Karnataka government has announced that only 50 may meet in mosques for Eid-ul-Azha and have banned prayer meetings at Eidgah and other sites due to the crown virus epidemic.
Guests who want to pray for in Moscows must have masks and keep away, according to the order from AB Ibrahim, the ministerial manager of minority groups and Wakf.

The order states that although prayer meetings are one of the most important muslims at the Bakrid Festival, such events will be banned at Eidgah and other sites due to the COVID-19 passport.
However, prayers will be allowed in Moscows, in order that no more than 50 share in one.
If more than this is to be done, the ministerial board says in the order.

The Karnataka governments allow the temple, mosquitoes and other prayer sites to be opened to those who wish to pray for from June 8th, giving good attention to the infectious agents due to COVID-19.
The U.S. Messenger wants a armed lifeguard
Jeffrey Ross Gunter, the U.S. missionary in Iceland, counts his life threatened in this country and wants to walk with weapons.
At the beginning of 2020, the U.S. embassy recruited the "bodyguard" of the Irish newspapers and actually used the word bodyguard in the advertisement.
According to the facts of Kneik, the main reason why these jobs were announced is that Jeffrey Ross Gunter considers his life threatened in Iceland.
In Iceland and abroad, a clown has been discussing with the authors who convince the ambassador that he is in a great danger, and the reason is that he is from the Jewish family.
Any threat is not as clear, but Kveik’s respondents said that Islamic terrorists had been called as a threat.
The CBS addressed the matter on its web this morning, and according to Washington’s sources, Gunter is being persecuted, demands to carry himself weapons, to get injected westerns and armed followers alongside gun - safe cars.
According to the CBS, Gunter has been withdrawn from the fact that there is no threat and that the advertisement of "bodyguard" is only to sleep Gunter.
According to Kneik’s claims, the positions in June were not available, but the request for application was expired in February.
According to the facts of Kneik, the U.S. Embassy has not submitted formal statements because of these changes.
Neither has been formally requested for an increased guardian or a copy of the laws of lifeguards to walk around the walls of the embassy.
Icelandic laws determine that this is not permitted except with a special copy of the Kingdom Police Officer.
Kneik’s respondents in the control system say no information is available on any kind of threat.
The latest risk assessment of the National Police Officer is quite decisive for terrorist threats.
There are no examples of terrorism in Iceland and no evidence that terrorist or peripheral groups are working here.
The heads of admission of the armor of a foreign embassy in the streets of cities and cities in Iceland, according to the claims of Kveik, are not present.
Gunter raised considerable attention in this country when he divided the Chief President of the United States and called the CVID-19 "China virus".
With the tits, he had the American and Icelandic flag.
A radioman in Seattle who feared Trump’s reactions to protests says that now it needs to get a gun after Starbucks Cafe under his apartment was put in ruin – RT USA News
Paul Gallant has received a new view of violent protests after he sucking at President Donald Trump in June because he said anarchists were burning and robbing Seattle City.

"Now it's enough, it looks like a street party down the street from me, very angry now."
The difference was quite different, as Trump complained for the last month that Mayor Seattle would allow violent Protestants to take over the city.
“ These liberal Democrats are unclean, ” said the president.
“ The terrorists burn and rob our cities, and they just think it is wonderful, even death. ”
Gallant, a co-director of the Danny & Gallant at the ESPN Cooperative Radio Station in Seattle, answered with a titt: “Go through there for curiosities last night, and he does not burn, robbery or death.
Gallant said last night that the police had advised the inhabitants to stay away from his apartment building where explosives could be found in the damaged Starbucks caffeine.
He published pictures of the damages, saying, “Good done, dumb, ” and said that he had also seen a few gates away.
"Have no idea what's going on, but we're going to find out."
The advertisement did not overcome people who feared that Gallant would be in his first view and chest messages such as “Just relax on lax, ” and “Yes, Trump may have been right. ”
Jason Rantz, another radioman in Seattle, said: “If we are not finally going to this viewpoint we talked about. ”
"Wached and seen that a bunch of people was cracking "snake on lax" to me. I laughed."
He said he was standing with his first statement, where he had passed through the CHAZ self-regulation area of an anarchist and although it was not as bad as it had been reported as.
“ Then they were burned and robbed after all, ” he said. “ Justified. ”

Counts too early to claim another wave here in the country
An adhesive specialist in the farm healthcare professional advises too early to claim the other wave of the epidemic.
Three new inland smits were diagnosed last night at the National Hospital’s Antiviral Department, and tens of them have been in a nutrient.
Two inland smits were diagnosed on Thursday, second in a man in the twentieth age but the other in a man in the 20 ’ s.
Then no infection had been diagnosed since the beginning of the month.
Last night, there were three additional inland smits, of which one had been at the Rey Cup Knight Congress in Laugardal.
In a conversation with a newsroom, John K. Johannsson, State Police Officer for Information, says that fewer had to be shown because of this infection than was originally considered.
The second is infected in a person who came to the country from the country on July 15th.
At that time, the rules on the so - called home permit had been valid.
However, Kamilla Ruth Sigfus daughter, a psychiatrist in the Medical Office, says that the respondent followed the old course.
His vision was negative when he arrived to the country, and he became sick and isolated, and has been seen in a disease.
All of them are on their way to show, but two of them are starting to show signs.
The third infection has been associated with the elderly man who was diagnosed on Thursday and has been put in a disease associated with it.
It has been seen that during the journey the new variation of the crown virus that has not been identified earlier in this country.
“ We don’t know exactly where this virus comes from, but we haven’t seen it before.
He who is considered to have carried the virus to the land had been in Israel, but also in other European countries."
It believes too early to claim that the so-called other waves of the passport have gone on this country, just as other countries in Europe fear.
“ While the majority are still expensive, it is not a table.
But we're on our toes and are watching, thinking of ways to fail if something like that could happen."

I'm interested in star signs, and I immediately knew that my twinshal was about it," says Fox, 34 years old.
“ The twins are when the soul has arrived sufficiently in existence so that it can divide into two different bodies at the same time,” explained Fox.
“ So we are two helmets of the same soul, I think.
I told him that as soon as we met.
I found it immediately."
“ When we had known for two days, I asked him to meet me at lunch, and I taught him about the stars and asked him in his life.
I decided to go to the depth immediately."
Machine Gun Kelly takes the same string, but they met with a movie.

Increased Strongness in Protests against Racial Rights in the United States
Protestants have walked through the streets of a number of cities in the United States to draw attention to race law.
There have been two months of protest in Portland, Oregon, since May 25, when George Floyd killed police in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Trump government has sent FBI officers to Portland, and thereby still under the protests.
Protestants are now also opposed to be the federal police officers in the city.
On Saturday, in Seattle, the police used bombs and tear gas and arrested 45 people after a protest meeting for supporting the protests in Portland was resolved in violence.
According to the police, over 20 policemen were hurt.
One died on Saturday night in Austin, Texas, when a gun ran into Black Lives Matter's demand walk.
The sources of the media say that the man may have gone up to a guned gun before he was shot.
“The core of the matter is that it is horrible that someone dies in protests, ” said Steve Adler, Chief of the City of Austin, in a statement.
Adler claimed to be “wrong and wordless. ”
In Lousville, Kentucky, a group of armed Protestants demanded justice in the case of Breonna Taylor, a black woman who died in Louisville when the police broke into her home, with a source of entry without banking, and shot her.
The loved Taylor had first shot to the police, because he thought they were infrared thieves.
One policeman has been fired because of Taylor's death, but the other police haven't been charged.
The president of the NFAC group, a armed group of black rebels who have participated in the protests, calls for more optimism in a police investigation on Taylor's murder.
According to police information, three NFAC members were injured on Saturday when accidental shooting of weapons in the rebellion army ran.
Possible group infection in conjunction
Five have been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection this week outside border skiing.
Two of them had previously diagnosed the unspecified variations of the virus and seemed to be quite unclear to the origin of three of the five infections.
It is uncertain whether the individuals have been infected by a tourist who has gone back from the country or the unidentified Islander, who would probably have been more infected.
An adjunct-resistant physician says that possible group infection may be in a conjunctivity associated with one of the infections.
Two were diagnosed with Covid-19 on the country last Thursday, with the type of virus.
The origin of the infections is still unclear.
Three were then diagnosed with the virus yesterday; one of them has been infected by others who were diagnosed on Thursday, another came to the country on July 15, and probably was infected outside, but the third is also infected with unseen origin.
Following a series analysis in the Icelandic genotype analysis, the two subjects who diagnosed the virus and associated with the virus have a new variant that has not been identified earlier in this country.
Camilla Joseph’s daughter, a diagnostic in the field of antibiotics, and a standard antiphylactic physician, says that the Iceland genetic analysis is now to examine the most likely presence of this type of virus.
“ The other case was a similar virus that has been active in Switzerland, but not quite the same.
They're going to look at this and try to map it better and lead the likes of which part of the world the infection comes out," she says.
"It seems, however, to be here on the edge of the Atlantic."
Thus, the infection is unrelated to the two who arrived at the beginning of July and were expelled to the United States.
Are you going out from the fact that this new species has come outside rather than having hoped out here in the country?
“Yeah, this is different from what has been found here before that there is really no chance that this was something to template here,” Camilla answers.
“ It is all likely that these individuals in some way have come to an end with a person who has just arrived outside, without knowing themselves. ”
Asked, it says that there is still no evidence of what this new virus might have come to the country.
“ Of course, it could be a traveler who has gone back from the country, but it could also be someone who does not get any signs and fails to realize that he has been infected, and that could naturally result in more infections.
We'll be on the toes next days to watch it."
“ Still, there is nothing that is clever group infection.
But there are individuals who went into a disease in connection with one of the infections yesterday, who have symptoms and have already gone to show," Camilla continues.
“ We haven’t had results from them yet.
Thus it could be a group infection in the consignment."
Do you suppose there's a social problem in progress now?
“ It is not excluded.
It hasn't been late, but it's not excluded because we don't know who has given this infection in these individuals, which were diagnosed on the other hand on Tuesday and yesterday."
Could it be said that this is now starting a new wave of the virus?
“ No, not yet.
But, of course, we need to be very carefully alert, and we need to keep in mind that even though there are such limits for how much we can take of people’s visions.
We don't take any signs in people without symptoms, but first we're getting infections that seem to be incompatible, we need to be given a little more free hands by taking a vision from people with symptoms," she says.
In this way, it is expected that the National Hospital Department of Antibiotics and Virologics will be present in the show in the next days to try to clarify the positions in this country better.
Does the National Hospital have the ability to increase the national display and to provide a distinction at the border?
“Not unlimited, no.
Therefore, there is a need to be a basis for taking a show in individuals who are not in the skiing tasks; the person needs to be in a pathologist and show symptoms, or then have had symptoms and suspects of having come into line with someone who is new to the country or something like that," says Kamilla.
It notes that the infections identified yesterday are still undergoing and that much work is now being done to obtain information about individuals’ journeys.
It says that the origin of the inside smits seems incompatible, but it does not exclude that any of those who have now been infected may bring evidence that eventually leads the infectious team to the original infections.

The fight against racial hatred and police violence has arisen after the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis in May.
On Saturday, protesters in Seattle screwed on wheelchairs and broke windows in wheelchairs on the protests, which led to police declaring inheritance and clearing the streets with pipars and bombs.
Protestants also set up in wheelchairs in a building area for a prospective youth prison.
The police had arrested 45 people, but 21 policemen would have hurt.
The protests were held to support the protests that stand in the neighbouring city of Portland, Oregon.
Portland is in the field light after Trump commanded very radical action by the Federal Police, in unthankful local authorities, who say the police use excessive power.
Contests have been held in Austin, Texas, and Louisville, Kentucky, New York, Omaha, Nebraska, Oakland, and Los Angeles, California, and Richmond, Virginia.
In Austin, the capital of Texas, one was shot to death in armed conflicts in the middle of the city on Saturday night, according to police.
Together with the protests, Trump is increasingly difficult to re-elect in November, and has adopted a harsh policy of law enforcement.
