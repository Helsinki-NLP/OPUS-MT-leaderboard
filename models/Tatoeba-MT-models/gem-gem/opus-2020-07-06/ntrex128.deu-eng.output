Members of the National Assembly for Wales Fears Deviations with the Muppets
The proposal to amend its title in MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Welsh Parliament) in some Members of the National Assembly disrupts.
This is why plans are to change the name of the National Assembly in 'Welsh Parliament' (Walisian Parliament).
National Assembly members of all political directions fear to become the target of the spot.
One member of the Labour Party of the National Assembly said that his group was concerned because the name is ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.
For non-walisian readers: In Wales, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A National Assembly Member of the Plaid Cymru Party stated that the whole group was not happy and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said that his group was open to the change of name, but pointed out the great similarity between MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the Wales letter w is expressed similar to the letter u in the English language spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission (National Assembly Committee), which is currently drafting a law on the change of names, said: “The final decision on the names of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, with the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public hearing on the proposals which showed wide support for the name 'Welsh Parliament' for the National Assembly.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Committee 'Welsh Parliament Members' (Walisian Members) or 'WMPs' preferred, while the 'MWP' option found the greatest support at a public hearing.
The Members of the National Assembly seem to propose alternative options, but the ringing of a consensus for President Elin Jones, who is going to present a draft legislation within weeks, could constitute a problem.
The law on the reforms will include further changes in the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules for disqualification of members of the National Assembly and the design of the Committee System.
Members of the National Assembly may finally vote on their names in their debate on the Law.
Macedonian votes in a referendum on a change in country name
The voters decide on Sunday whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was appointed to present a decadent dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the similar name Macedonia.
Athens has long been saying that the name of its Northern Neighbour means that this right is raised to the Greek area and has repeatedly spoken against its entry into the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not accept the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is the price to be paid for accession to the EU and to NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's silence in view of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people with whom I spoke said that in the past there had been a bar and a church at every corner,” said Adams.
"Today, there are both things no longer."
He said the disappearance of the bars is perceiveable.
“The social life of people looks different today,” he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people are regularly invented."
In the churches he fears that the money from the sale of assets is not enough as long as the church leaders accept, and that they “will be at the beginning before or later”.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with property apartments where people who do not support the remaining refugees.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these property apartments become members of these churches.”
Both churches were established by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
In the 1930s, the original white methodist community moved out.
A black congregation that held their worships nearby became owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black municipality under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a Boykott by retailers in the 125th Street, a large shopping street in Harlem who refused to set or support blacks.
At a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson’s members planned to rebuild, they ordered the bell game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly referred to the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who said the bell game in July, used other words: "A Cultural Treasure" and "an inconsistent historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had changed to the bigger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has been played in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors, which have been added partly by the leaders of the church and partly by the Bishop Diocese.
In July, the municipal leadership – the leadership body of the municipality – expressed written concerns to the Diocese that the diocese would try to forward the costs to the local board, although it had not been involved in the commission of architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
Some members of the municipality complain about lack of transparency on the sides of the diocese.
Hai injured in California 13-year-olds when diving to praisers
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, a shark, according to official statements, attacked a 13-year-old boy during diving to praise stars.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told the sender KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends on Saturday morning for about half an hour when he heard the boy's help cry and with several others padled to the boy to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy was happy to have caught a praiser, but then he realized that the boy cried “I was biten!
I've been bitched!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his whole key leg had been screwed up.
“I cried that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flew to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in a critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Captain Larry Giles said to the media that a few weeks before a shark had been seen in the area, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
For investigation purposes and for safety reasons, officials blocked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swaami's in Encinitas for 48 hours.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but mostly not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plant support for the cosmetic market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's attacks with convenient cosmetics divisions occupied with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs and debenhams.
In the framework of a large-scale promotion of the 2.8 billion UK pounds of cosmetic market in the United Kingdom, which continues to grow while fashion and budgetary product sales fall, the larger cosmetic distributions in 11 branches are tested throughout the country. If they prove to be successful, they will be expanded to further branches next year.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to the search for supermarkets for opportunities to use store areas used elsewhere for television, microwave and household products.
According to Sainsbury's, the scope of his cosmetic offer is doubled for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and brand areas similar to those in shops like boats.
In addition, the supermarket runs a relaunch of its makeup series “Boutique” so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance shop is tested in two Sainsbury's family sales sites. The first sales office was opened last week in Croydon in the south of London, and one second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham in the next year.
Online shopping and the transition to daily purchase of small quantities of food in local needs articles means that supermarkets need to do more to allow customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the sales sites are increasingly looking like shops, as the supermarket chain with more services and non-food articles attempts to fight against the discounts of Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has since the purchase of the chains Argos and Habitat set up in hundreds of branches of Argos sales offices and also a number of Habitat sales offices. This has increased food turnover and the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats at the beginning of the 2000s, but after a dispute on the distribution of revenues from the branches of the drug dealer in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's sale to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million UK pounds three years ago.
The company indicated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan in the way that, in four branches, an extended range of luxury skin care brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy will be added.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our cosmetics divisions to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is cut to all needs. Due to the encouraging environment and the favourable locations, we are now an attractive goal for cosmetic purchases that challenges the previous type of shopping."
Peter Jones “wrong” after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a business worth 11 million British pounds
“Dragons” Den” Peter Jones is “wrong” after the TV moder Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from an 11 million UK pound with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the common homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared with Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The “This Morning” fashioner, 37, announced her withdrawal to Instagram.
Holly Willoughby indignated “Dragons” Den” star Peter Jones through its very short-term withdrawal from her luxurious lifestyle brand company to focus on their own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones was supposed to have been angry when the "Golden Girl" of the television at an excited meeting on Tuesday in the central of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted to the unable to devote time enough due to its new businesses – up to 1.5 million British pounds – to the common homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The company was compared with Gwyneth Paltrows Brand Goop and would probably have doubled Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million British pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly at Instagram, Jones left Britain on the way to one of his holiday domains.
One source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly with distance.
It should guarantee her future for the long term over the next decades.
Their decision for the withdrawal was completely surprising for all stakeholders.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, as soon as the market was introduced.
In the central in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” modernator, which belongs to the most promising stars in the UK, could cost millions of the company due to high investments in products from kisses and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in the introduction of the market.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been closely friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a share of 40 percent in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is intended to be a brand messenger for M&S and to replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of the ITV broadcast "I'm A Celebrity".
A nearby source Jones said yesterday night: "We don't comment on his business matters."
Heavy words “and then we fell in love”
He spoke about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider as "non-president" and for such positive statements about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said that the voice of a newsmoderator imitate:
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the first meeting in Singapore was praised by Trump in June as a major step towards denuclearisation by North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have been staged.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the top diplomat of North Korea, said on Saturday against leading politicians from all over the world at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see any “compliant” response to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he found that the United States held sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his advertisement speech.
"We are very successful with North Korea," he said.
“We faced a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim showed positive results: the end of the rocket tests, the support for the release of hostiles and the return of the mortal survivors of American military members.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside and trying to come into this overfilled arena, about 200 people would stand here," said Trump, pointing to the crowd directly before him.
Tsunami and earthquakes ruin a island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of human lives
For example, after the earthquake of Lombok, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population were displaced from Lombok, no national emergency was declared a prerequisite for mobilisation of international aid.
“In many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international support, so that's a little difficult," said Summung.
While Save the Children creates a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet sure whether foreign employees can work on the site.
Sutopo, spokesman of the Catastrophen Protection Authority, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to whether international bodies would be able to participate in the aid measures.
In view of the shaking of the earth that Indonesia has constantly to fight with, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While accommodations were built in Aceh Tsunami, they are not a everyday view on other coastal stripes.
The obvious lack of tsunami warnsirene in Palu, despite a warrant, has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is a challenge in the optimum case.
Through natural disasters, logistics becomes even more complicated.
A Lazarett ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but will reach the place of the new disaster at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure to the core of his election campaign and has spent plenty of money for roads and trains.
However, the government of the next year's re-electing Joco suffers from financial deficits.
Furthermore, Joko is under pressure by persistent confession tensions in Indonesia. Members of the Muslim majority there practice a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes and apartments when bands of Christians and Muslims fought on the streets with mashes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.

The Cromwell State before Parliament will be the subject of the dispute on the rewrite of history as a new monument
Their exile would be poetic justice for his memorable destruction of the Taliban so many cultural and religious art products of England by his fanatic puritan attendants.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as “tority” and “request to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was unavoidable in the current debate on the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's standing was the goal of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not arrange or perform the picturestorm in the English civil wars.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell is proof of the opinion and part of the history of a figure, which is still worth celebrating in the 19th century.
Goldsmith said to the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, as one who defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether it is an entirely applicable representation, it is subject to continued history debates.
Certainly, the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognized figure that represents one side of this gap.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating them and remembering them."
Killer Swine bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer on a market in the southwest China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the surname was called “Yuan” was found dead with a divided arthritis in the vicinity of a pigstall on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is ready to inject pigs vaccines in the province of Qinghai, China, on May 30, 2005 in Xining.
He was reporting on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pigstall was open.
He said there was a big male pig with blood on the snail.
According to the report, a forensical investigation confirmed that the 250 kilograms heavy pig had beaten the farmers dead.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and diminished," the cousin, called "Wu", was quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings of a security camera showed how Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan nor his cousin.
A market manager said to the Evening News that the pig was locked in to prevent attacks on other people while the police collected evidence at the crime site.
Yuan's family and the market authorities, according to reports, negotiate a compensation for his death.
Although it is rare that pigs attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on her farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290 pounds of heavy pig had a whale farmer between herself and a tractor until the farmer's wife could hurry the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs would normally not be aggressive, but that the taste of blood could act as a “extractor”.
“You're only played.
They're very curious, they're not trying to hurt someone.
It is only necessary to treat them with the right degree of respect," he said.
The remains of Hurrikan Rosa brings widely widely spread strong rain into the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurrikan Rosa is weakening on the way over the colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring overflows of rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock East Coast Time, Rosa showed wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to an ornament of category 1, and was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form over the Pacific, which moves towards the east to the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported to the north in the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will trigger up to 25 centimeters of rainfall on Monday in parts of Mexico.
In the coming days the tropical moisture generates widely widespread downfalls in the southwest by interactions with the trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of decay can cause dangerous flood-like flooding, water-driving guns and possibly earth-roads in the desert.
High tropical humidity leads to decay rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 inches of defeat is expected.
Due to the spread of the tropical rainfall, there is a possibility of flood-like flooding with rapidly worsening conditions.
Given the threatening tropical defeat, it is urgently advised to go to the desert.
Strong rainfall can result in the beating streams of Canyon, and thunders locally bring windbows and wind that leads dust.
The nearest trough brings locally strong rain in parts of the coast of South California.
The total amount of downfall may be more than a centimeter, which can lead to low-scale shoes in the water and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in this region.
The first single tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains.
On Tuesday, strong rain spreads into the Four-Corners region and holds on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the United States, as the Arctic is cooling, while the tropicals remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of nearly 12 oC.
In the next days, the continuous summer heat tries to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the Middle and East of the United States, a warm October beginning with widespread temperatures is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach on Tuesday 27 oC, which is about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above average temperatures in the first October half of the East of the United States.
More than 20 million spectators have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million spectators have seen on Thursday at six television networks the impressive statements of the Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political patt situation stopped. On Friday, the television broadcasters interrupted their regular program because of a change in the last minute: one agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, so the FBI will conduct a weekly examination of the accusations.
Ford said to the Senate’s Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, insisted on her and tried to remove her clothes.
In a passionate statement, Kavanaugh said that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20,4 million spectators reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company determined the average spectator numbers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen usually has problems with measuring spectator numbers in offices.
To get this into the right perspective: this corresponds in about the spectator numbers in a play-off football game or in the Oscar rental.
The Sender Fox News Channel, whose measuring moderns strongly support the nomination of Kavanaughs, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million spectators of the whole day hearing.
ABC came with 3.26 million spectators in second place.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million spectators.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Drama of Friday.
After the office of the modest Republicaner had published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras by CNN and CBS, as protesting him in the wheelchair on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee with words.
He stood with a reduced view for minutes while he was swallowed. The scene was transferred live at CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you believe that he tells the country the truth?"
“You have power while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said that his office had published a statement and supplemented before the lift concluded that he would have more to say at the hearing before the Committee.
All cable and radio networks sent hours later live when the Judgment Committee should vote to the entire Senate on the forwarding of the nomination of Kavanaughs for the vote.
Flake, however, said that he would do this only under the precondition that the FBI, like the democratic minority, demands the accusations against the candidates in the next week.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with a friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance, since it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes for the confirmation of Kavanaugh.
President Trump has made an FBI investigation of the charges charged against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics to use the Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper of her plans for departure from the European Union to use the future of Britain for political purposes and to undermine the nation's interests.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May joins the Conservative Party party in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview published with her on the page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on its so-called "Chequers Plan" for the Brexit by calling for a proposal which provides for the mutual entering of customs by the UK and the EU as "voluntary absurd".
Fatal shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrests suspects Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shots on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned by the police of Baton Rouge for death.
The Authority published video recordings of the dispute between Sims and Simpson. According to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.

On Friday morning, the basketball trainer of the LSU, Will Wade, said that the team was “cooked ” over Wayde's death and “stay under shock”.
"You're always afraid of such a thing," said Wade.
Vulcan spit ashes on Mexico City.
The southern quarter of the Mexican capital has reached ashes ejected from the Vulcan Popocatepetl.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity had increased in the crater and was registered within 24 hours 183 emissions of gas and ashes.
The Authority monitored many cases of shaking and shaking.
Pictures in social media showed thin ashes on the windshields of cars in quarters of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.

The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Conflicts between police and Catalan separatists before anniversary of independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after collapsing between the peace police and pro-independence demonstrators. Thousands participated in other demonstrations to remember the first anniversary of the Polar Independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists retained by the rescue police was thrown with eggs and also sliced colour powder, so that in the normally populated streets of dark dust clouds.
During the next day, there were also handmengs with the police who used their strokes to control the fights.
For several hours, pro-independence groups "No forgotten, no forgiveness" were scanned, while Unionists called "Long Living Spain".
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for smaller injuries in the protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was seen illegally by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region is still very excited.
The voters had decided with an overwhelming majority for independence, although the participation in the elections was low, as the distortors were mostly bocottating the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in violent collapses before the elections.
Pro-Independence Groups had fought outside on Friday overnight to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the protest of the separatists with his wife, said that he sees the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose, but now we hang fast," he said.
Despite an important, although narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan Pro Independence Partys of this year had difficulty maintaining the swing. Many of their most famous leaders are either in exile or in prison, where they are waiting for their procedures because of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanist who recorded the protest to the police on his phone, said that the conflict was cut by politicians on both sides.
“The situation becomes increasingly excited,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in investigation since the end of last year, announced his candidate for the election to the European Parliament next year.
"As a candidate for European elections, it is the best way to stimulate the degradation of democratic values and the oppression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after the house had been hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been buried several times by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 p.m. after the British summer time.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
In addition, a bracelet may have been shot on the car with a bracelet.
Menga hits means for Livingston 1:0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first gate for Livingston secured the victory.
The upcoming Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Association.
Dolly Mengas hits proved to be crucial for Gary Holt's team to be like Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team stays in this season without outward victory in the premiership and stands toward the Hearts, which are eight points behind the next Sunday.
Previously, the Rangers are hosts in the Europe League for Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
Livingston can in the meantime increase his victory series in the division to six games, that is, Chieftrainer Holt has no defeat since his acquisition of Kenny Miler in the last month.
Livingston misses opportunities for freely playing guests
Holt's team had to be in charge for a long time before the hit, as his directness faced the Rangers with the various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the gate. Then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he was here to meet Craig Halkett's head shot by the gate.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of themselves because they knew they could hinder the guests at standard situations.
In this way the decisive gate came.
The Rangers allowed a free jump, and Livingston prepared a chance to bring Menga together with Declan Gallagher and Robinson into a gun position. This shot the gate with a ball contact from the middle of the Criminal Area.
During this phase, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but the host's defense could not overcome, and torkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unhealthy.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos Kelly once forced to warn.
Scott Pittman was warned by the Rangers Tower Guard Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow cut the ball out of another standard situation of Livingston.
Flakes were repeatedly brought into the penalty room of Livingston and were regularly taken out of the danger area, while two required penalties were refused – one of Halketts against the interchanged Glenn Middleton and one for the purpose of manoeuvre.
"Phenomenal" of Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont by BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally excellent and have overcome the expectations of this upward trend.
Their playstyle and team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt is a great commendation for the way in which he has watched the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and launched an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held on the trab throughout the game.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as in time under Gerrard, they couldn't achieve this standard.
Their last ball was inadequate – only once they could pass through the host's team – and this is something like a week call for the Rangers that are in the middle of the table.
Received Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29th, leaming faces and blue heavens were prevailing when the government chiefs of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO's allies.
There had been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and the accession of the EU to Turkey.
Then Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is the home of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police mentioned safety reasons for preventing a 25,000 people from gathering before the mosque, but many followers found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurds – also received hearing. They condemned Erdogan's policy as well as the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The contradictory protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German Turks as a hero and smashed by others than carcrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicycle drivers die in collapse with car
A cyclist died in London in a collapse with a car.
The collapse took place at about 10:15 o'clock of British summer time near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a trafficy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and sanitary cared for the man, but died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another bicycle driver had died in an accident with driver flight in the Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the accident from Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and to notify his next family.
Road locks and switches for buses are set up, and the drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six officials injured on unrest
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in an emergency prison for men.
The rests broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. of the British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still stopped.
Specialized "Tornado" officials have been added to end the distresses in which eight insassesses are involved and are limited to a wings.
The officials were treated locally for smaller injuries in the face.
One spokesman of the Prison Service said: “It was used specially trained prison staff to fix an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to clarify that the police responsible will be handed over and may spend a long time behind grids."
In HMP Long Lartin there are more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals of the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison leader was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, officials were sent to prison to deal with severe distresses in which the staff was attacked with pool balls.
Hurrikan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with floody floods (through areas may benefit)
It rarely occurs that a tropical depression at Arizona, but this will probably happen early next week when the rest of Orkaan Rosa moves across the southwest deserts and brings the risk of flooding floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about flooding floods on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada as well as the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday evening and travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix informed in a Tweet that “from 1950 only ten tropical cycles have reached Phoenix as a tropical storm or tropical depression up to 320 kilometres!
Katrina (1967) was a Hurricane within 64 kilometres from Arizona's border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of decay with up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including the central rockies and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5 to 5 centimeters and a total of up to 10 centimeters possible.
For those in whom there is no risk of floody floods, the depressions associated with Rosa may be a blessing due to the dryness in the region.
Although floods are greatly concerned, these rains are likely to be partly useful, since the southwest is currently dry.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, some more than 40 percent of Arizona appears at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reported Weather.com.
First, the path of the Hurricane means that Rosa will meet on land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have an orkan starch with maximum winds of 136 kilometres per hour and is located 620 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico. Then the orkan will move to the north with 19 kilometres per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will meet on colder water and thus weaken.
It is therefore expected that Rosa meets in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm on land.
The rainfall may be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora desert, rainfall sums are expected from 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible”, reported Weather.com.
Then Rosa will, as a tropical storm, move northward across Mexico, reach the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as tropical depression, and then move up to the south of Utah until late Tuesday evening through Arizona.
“As a major danger in connection with Rosa or its remains, very strong rainfall is expected in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora desert and the southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center informed.
As a result of these defeat, life-threatening flooding floods and water-driving guns are expected in the desert as well as in mountainous territories.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murders
After the discovery of a 16-year-old who was in Somerset, three boys were arrested in teenage age and a 20-year-old man under the suspicion of the attempted murder.
The teenager was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 a.m.
He was brought to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to the police of Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested in the bike area overnight.
The officials asked everyone who had records of events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered “under the community, the anger of the Democrats”.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the creepy and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats," said Trump at a announcement in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during the entire nomination process Kavanaugh suffered “under the common, the angry of the Democrats”.
Kavanaugh said out on Thursday before the convention and rejected the accusation raised by Christine Blasey Ford, he had sexually offended them decades ago when both teenagers were.
Ford also declared her accusation at the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw the brillance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on this day.
“A voice for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal heads of our time, a lawyer with an excellent balance in the service of the general", he said the amount of his followers in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our life.
I don't touch, but actually I'm going to go on," he said.
"This is why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the Democrats were seeing their mission to “standstanding and blocking”.
The first important procedureal vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place at the Senate at the latest on Friday, said a high staff of the GOP leadership against CNN.
Hundreds killed at earthquakes in Indonesia, numbers of victims increase
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people were killed. Many of them were flooded away when, due to a strong earthquake and a tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, gigantic waves hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people had met on Friday at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when the inbreak of darkness hit up to six metres high waves on the beach, and there were many people dying and destroying all that was in their way.
The tsunami had preceded a earthquake of strength 7.5.
“When the threat of the Tsunami came up yesterday, people continued to pursue their activities on the beach and did not run away immediately, and they fell to him as a victim,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, speaker of the Indonesian Catastrophen Protection Authority BBB at a Jakarta conference.
"The Tsunami didn't come alone, he swimed cars, trees and houses, he met all the land," said Nugroho. He added that the Tsunami had moved over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he met to the coast.
Some people were climbed on trees on the flight from the tsunami and had survived, he said.
Approximately 16.700 people were evacuated and placed in 24 centers in Palu.
Air recordings published by the Catastrophen Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, curved and crashed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town was shaken by other neighbors.
The earthquake series was found in a area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a declaration that in the massive cube released from Friday, energy corresponded to the 200-fold energy of the nuclear bomb thrown on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
Due to the situation of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the Tsunami could have grown, said the Authority.
Nugroho described the damage as "inclusive" and indicated that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were collapsed.
According to his data, the bodies of some victims were found under the casualties of injured buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damages along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in a area named Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the population, could have been higher.
The communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a Red Cross declaration, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on the way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse," said the declaration.
On Saturday, the Authority was often criticized that she had not informed about the fact that a Tsunami Palu had met, although the waves appeared in official information at the time of warning.
Amateur recordings published in social media show a man in the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the street under him from the nearing tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall powers on the shore and swims buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not check the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
By cube and tsunami, there was a massive waste of electricity that interrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue measures.
According to the authorities, the military has started to send freight aircraft with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuates still need food and other vital goods.
The airport of the city remains closed until October and was only opened for assistance.
For Sunday, a visit was planned by President Joko Widodo to evacuation centres in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala have securely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are in tent accommodations in their office's courtyard, but according to the words of Dosebas, they came across scenes of destruction.
“They told them they had seen many destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Even when the auxiliary groups began to launch disaster aid, some assumed that professional foreign helpers would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, delivery and staff from abroad are only possible when the place of an accident has been explained to the national disaster area.
This hasn't happened until now.
“The moment is still a disaster at province level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'okay, this is a national disaster', we can accept international support, but this status is not valid until now."
While the second night since the earthquake and the tsunami fell over Palu from Friday, friends and family members of the missing ones hoped for one of the miracles that revealed the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was pulled out of a wastewater channel.
On Sunday, rescue forces liberated a woman who had been knocked up under drums for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indian Paragliding National Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders to finish Asia games for the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Other of those in the Roa-Roa hotel were prisoners, as Monday added, his students.
"As senior at the paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon explained how he had sent in the hours after the message of the crash of the Roa-Roa hotel among the paragliders, desperately whatsApp messages to the racers from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
His news, however, only led to grey question marks instead of blue chicks.
“I think that means that the news was not posted,” he said.
Diebe steal 26.750 US dollars while filling a money machine in Newport on the Levee

According to the press release, Witnesses saw several suspects flee from the crime scene, but the police did not indicate how many people were involved in the incident.
People who have information on the identity of suspects are asked to contact the police of Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name – in Ye.
At the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West” (The officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has used the nickname Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eight album published in June.
The change precedes its appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the publication of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
It appears in the consignment as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, which, according to the producer's information, has rejected for 'emotional reasons'.
The word is not only a shortening of its current professional name, but it, according to its own statement, has a religious significance for West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘du’”, said West this year in a conversation about his album with radiomoderator Big Boy.
"I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only’, only ‘Ye’ – just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album reflects rather what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with which West worked earlier, has already written his name with and without binding and uppercase letters.
Mexico's AMLO promised not to use the military against civilian population
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador praised never to apply military violence against civilian populations while the 50th anniversary of bloody repressals against students in his country is nearing.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, “never the military to undermine the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers had fired on a peaceful demonstration on the spot and killed 300 people. At that time, left-righted student movements were working to establish themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador praised to support young Mexicans through monthly support for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of education led young people to criminal bands.
The United States should double financial resources for artificial intelligence
In view of the increased Chinese activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double their research expenditure in this field, says Investor and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who was active in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow on KI announcements from various areas of the US government, although the United States generally lacks a formal KI strategy.
In the meantime, China presented his plan last year: the country intends to become the No. 1 in the area of KI innovation by 2030.
"The duplicate of the budget for the KI research would be a good start in view of the fact that all other countries are so much further behind the USA. We are looking for the next breakthrough of the KI," said Lee.
The double of the financial resources could double the chances that the next big KI outcome would be achieved in the USA, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of the company Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University at a KI system that conquered the highest positioned American Othello player. Later he was leader at Microsoft Research and President of the Google office in China.
Lee appreciated former technologie competitions from the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and asked for the time of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Read Words, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies.
“Not China takes the academic tops away, but the companies,” said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have set up Korypees from universities to work at KI.
According to Read, a changed immigration policy of the United States could also be beneficial for the United States' KI activities.
“I think that in the area of the KI promovated people should automatically be offered Greencards,” he said.
In July 2017, China's State Council presented its plan for the development of the next generation of KI technology (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Read Words, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people to academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations donated money to US researchers, but the quality of the academic work in China is lower.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defense founded the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to be involved in the partner of industry and science. The White House also announced the establishment of a Special Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month the investment of 2 billion US dollars in the ‘AI Next’ initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million dollars per year in the KI research.
In the meantime, nothing has been done in US terms about the education of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonian votes in referendum on a change in country name
The population of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would bring a decade of old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's requests for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours means that this right is raised to the Greek territory, and that is why Greece has introduced a veto against the entry of Macedonia into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments concluded an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavian majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum. A Boykott campaign doubts that the election participation reaches the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the voting point was: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belong, argue that the price for Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the entry into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the screen of the European Union, as this means a safer life for us all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would follow the result so that it is crucial.
The amendment to the name would require a second-third majority in Parliament.
The State election Commission said that there had been no reports of irregularities until 13.00 p.m.
However, the participation in the elections was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last elections in 2016, where 66 percent of the registered voters had voted.
"I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko departed on 30 September 2018 in Srumica, Macedonia, their voice in the referendum on the change of the country's name, which Macedonia would open the way for accession to NATO and to the European Union.
Before the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs before tents, set up by people who wanted the referendum to boycott.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads raised, not by the back entrance," said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of integration between Europe and Asia."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will have urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be for it, as more than 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," said Zaev after his vote.
According to his words, a “Yes” result would be a ‘continuation of our future’.
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of the voters would participate in the referendum. This number is below the necessary participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian Sender Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote with 'Yes'.
In order to succeed the referendum, the election participation must be at 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first difficult struggle for the policy of the prowest government since its powers took place in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero by Manchester City Manoeuvred by the whole Brighton Defense to reach the gate
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling passed the Brighton defense on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester at the 2:0 victory of Manchester City.
Aguero made his match look ridiculously easy in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle field.
He rushed between three Brighton fighters and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green tricots.
He played around a defender and then picked up several other defenders at the edge of the Criminal Area of Brighton.
Then he shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the Criminal Room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overwhelmed Mathew Ryan with his right shoe Brighton torque guard and shot to the right side of the network.
"Aguero fights with problems in his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We had told him to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he had reached a gate at this moment."
It was Sterling, however, who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier-League valley.
This gate fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this train far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steilpass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to drive Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky-Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net just before he kicked out.
City plays in the Champions-League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the rockies the game
Since the nationals are excluded from the Playoff competition, there was little reason to force another effort.
However, the always volunteer Scherzer hopes to stand against the Colorado Rockies on the hill on Sunday, but only if this is relevant to the rockies that have a game precursor before the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies achieved at least one wildcard with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still wants to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can throw at least because we know the atmosphere of the audiences here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that would meet me this year.
Why should I not want to participate in this competition?"
The nationals have not announced a starting player for Sunday, but, according to reports, they are inclined to let cheers throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th start player, practiced on Thursday in the Bullpen and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington Judge has a statistics of 18-7, an ERA of 2,53 and 300 Strikeouts in 220 2/3 Innings.
Trump stops customership in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation in connection with the situation in relation to the Brett Kavanaugh, which he selected for the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the participation of the Republican voters in the interim elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our life.
This is one of the big, big – I don't get on, but in reality I'm attracting, that's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happen at the moment.
And they are determined to take the power again with all means, you see the commonness, the disgustingness.
It doesn't matter who they hurt who they have to cross to receive power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we will not give them."
The Democrats, he said, are seeing their mission in "to resist and block".
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, and he referred to the Democrats as "wrong and malicious and disgusting and dishonest."
He called the highest Democrat in the Senate’s Judgment Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud Buhrufe at the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document come out?
Oh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for you one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer allowed to apply all opinions.
The party is intolerant to those who say their opinion.
When the Momentum-Activists in my local party voted for tormenting me, this came a little surprising.
Finally, I am the last of a number of Labour Members who are told that they are not welcome - only because we say our opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had intensely opposed antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the Tadels' request that I had a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar topics that Jeremy did not agree with former politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour session on Friday stated that 'the meetings should be all included and productive'.
Most of the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as local Labour Member were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most meetings today have not been influenced by this tone, and the promised 'friendlyer, more cautious' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever started.
It becomes increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that every opinion will be assessed afterwards whether it is accepted by the party head.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a party leader.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn't matter what I say –, a shamefirade in the social media that calls for my abstract will appeal to the political center and say that I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I'm not alone.
In fact, I know that I am better than some of my colleagues, as the comments made to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of the colleagues who face daily a flood of sexist or racist insults, nevertheless giving up little.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that humiliation has become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn asked the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance last week.
In fact, we are not all of our opinions, and with every mistrust request and any change in the rules of election, the party becomes more closer.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to take my head and not to express my opinion so clearly, and then I would not have any problems.
But I did not go into politics for this purpose.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, I have struggled for better public services for those who need them most urgently – as a municipal council as well as as a cabinet minister since my classroom was literally distinguished in the entire school, as a student party.
I never made a hehl from my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
I would just like to say to the supporters of the Friday request: Given the fact that the country will rest on a breexit, harm the households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I am proud of serving you, not Nottingham Momentum, but of my voters, regardless of whether they are labor members or not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that so many dismissal threats or political purpose threats will not prevent me from acting in my opinion the best interest of you all.

Ayr vs melrose 38:17: Unwrought Ayr team rises up at the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this extremely entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams on the top of the table.
Finally, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as to their better use of opportunities, and trainer Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in our games until now, and we are still unfeeling, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Recognition for Ayr, they have better valued their chances than we."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, Melrose, due to a yellow card for the Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game from the Warriors, was able to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot started an unelevated attempt.
Climo built the leadership of Ayr with a penalty before he reached a hit right at half time and then made an increased attempt in the single instant so that it was at the break 17:5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half-time well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
Afterwards, there was a longer interruption due to a severe violation of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the field of the game. After continuing, Ayr built his precursor through a attempt by Climo increased by Stafford McDowall.
Then, as the captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose returned to pay the additional man at the end of a phase of enormous pressure by a non-elevated attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for thanking without ball against Climo, MacPherson obtained from the criminal gas from a touchdown behind the backing Ayr package.
Climo increased almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong's box kick and the flank player Gregor Henry sent off to the fifth attempt of the home team.
“Still Game” Star seems ready for new career in gastronomics
“Still Game” Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a change to the host industry after it became known as the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, whose turnbooks he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the coming nineth staffels will be the last of the mission, and Kiernan seems to plan a life after Craiglang.
According to official registrations, he is Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a source of the Scotish Sun claimed that Kiernan was interested in getting into Glasgow's "blomming restaurant shop".
“The sea belongs to us” means the Bolivia incorporated by the country hopes that a court will open him the way to the Pacific
Matrosen patrouillizes before the diving headquarters in La Paz.
On public buildings a seal blue flag.
Flotten base from Titicacasee to Amazon wears the motto: “The sea is our legal property.
Recovering is a duty."
Everywhere in Bolivia included in the country, the memory of the coastal section that was lost in a bloody conflict of resources in Chile in the 19th century is still as vivid as the desire to drive over the Pacific.
These hopes may not be as strong as for decades since Bolivia is waiting for a judgment of the International Court of Justice, which will be taken after five years of discussion on 1 October.
"Bolivia has the vibration, a spirit of unity and patience and expects the result of course with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are prosecuted by the IGH's judgment on large screens, in the hope that the court in the Hague decides for the benefit of Bolivia's demand. According to this, Chile is obliged to negotiate on the sovereign access of Bolivia to the sea after decades of sporadic discussions.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic Indian president, which is a controversial struggle for his re-election next year, the judgment on Monday is also at stake.
“We are shortly ahead of returning to the Pacific”, he praised at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court decides to benefit Bolivia and believe that it would also change little.
The UN body with a headquarters in the Netherlands is not empowered to speak to the Chilean territory and has decided that it will not decide on the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the IGH's judgment has been held six months after the final plea, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, suggests that the case was "non-complicated".
Apart from supporting Bolivia's case, the last four years could also be a relapse.
"The current Bolivian government has raised the issue of access to the sea," said Zárate.
She suggested that Morales' warrioric rhetoric has knocked every remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue their discussions, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the view that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia has “a extraordinary opportunity to introduce a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to“ bring an end to the 139 years of disputes for the benefit of each other,” he said.
Calzadilla also contests that Morales – still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America – uses the theme of the sea as a political crochet.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to recognize that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament only takes place if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons first if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made in Singapore during a summit between the Heads of State of the Rivals.
His statements come at a time when the U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, appears to be shortly in line with the Nordkorean Head of State Kim Jong-un, in Singapore, to restart the solid nuclear diplomacy.
Ri referred to the idea that further sanctions and opposition of the United States against a declaration of termination of the Korea war would ever force the north to the knees as "heartspinst".
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the statement without taking essential steps to disarmament first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pjöngyng seriously means it with the absence of an arsenal where the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjöngyng for next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Mode views in Paris show the latest collections for huge head covers that will be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hut collection or fully protect the sun, you don't have to look for it anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a range of crazy overwhelming head covers for their summer collection 2019, which fascinated the fashion world at the Paris fashion week.
Extremely unpractical hats have flooded instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their exciting creations over the course.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige-coloured hat with a featherlike wide edge, which just pushed the heads of the models.
As other overdimensional accessories, water melons occupied with jewels, a magic hat and even an ananas were shown, but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a number of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were equipped with lips and had more similarity with Hannibal Lecter than with skin couture.
One creation was similar to a diving equipment, including snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a smolten ice cream.
And if you want to put another huge fashion record, you'll be lucky.
Mode observers predict that the huge head covers could find their way in shopping streets near you.
The overdimensional huts follow directly on “La Bomba”, the Strohhut with 60 centimeters wide edge, which all wear from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractical hat, which hit large waves in social media, sent another big creation over the walking steps: a beach bag of straw, which was almost as large as the bathing suitcase that held the pocket.
The bastack in red orange with bast french and a white leather hill was the highlighting piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris fashion week.
Professor Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: “I expect large shelters and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets for the next summer. The designer has been so excited that the demand for over-dimensional accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills for world citizens indispensable
Scotland's independent schools continue to be characterized by academic excellence. This has continued in 2018 with further outstanding test results and is only supported by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other Community businesses.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools pursue the goal of preparing their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their elections and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector, which can make a customized teaching plan and actually implement it, we see that modern languages are still popular and desired in schools as electoral fields.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak with someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart."
This is an impressive reminder that we cannot only rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current test results of this year we find that languages with the highest existence rates are at the top of the ranklists of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved note A in the higher trials.
According to the data collected by 74 SCIS member schools, 72 percent of the students in Mandarin achieved note A during the higher trials, while 72 percent of the students who learned German, 69 percent of the students who learned French, and 63 percent of the students who learned Spanish also achieved note A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today languages are considered as electoral fields as well as STEM fields (natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the teaching plans of independent schools and other places.
According to a survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014, 17 percent of the reasons which employers mentioned for the problems of occupying open offices were associated with lack of language knowledge.
Thus, language skills are increasingly required in order to prepare young people for their future profession.
Since more open places require languages, these knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the job chosen, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage by such lifelong ability in the future.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, multilingual people will automatically provide a precursor to fellow candidates.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent could not speak well enough foreign languages to lead a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language of a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language education.
Children who speak several languages, especially languages from developing countries, will have better chances of finding a meaningful employment.
In Scotland different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught, which are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, for example Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests are, in independent schools, a number of languages with specialized teachers will always be chosen.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares the children and provides them with the skills needed for their success, whatever the future is.
At that time, in a global economic environment, it is not possible to deny that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, and that is why this must reflect in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be considered as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il runs bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron for Lakers-Debut on Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James arrive for the first time for the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting soon ends.
Lakers-Trainer Luke Walton announced that on Sunday James will play against Denver Nuggets in San Diego in the opening game of the presaison.
How many minutes he will play, however, is not yet firm.
“It will be more than one and less than 48” said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twittered that James will probably play a few minutes.
At the beginning of this week, James was asked after training after his plans for the six games a comprehensive presaison game plan of the Lakers.
“I don’t need presaison games in this phase of my career to prepare myself,” he said.
Time for Trumps Customer service in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, a number of election campaigns.
This is the first of Trumps five announcements planned for the next week, including well-minded places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In view of the floating vote on the confirmation of his election for the vacation at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the forthcoming half-time elections in November, as the Republicans are in danger of losing control over the Congress.
When does Trumps announcement take place in West Virginia tonight, and how can you view online?
Trump's quest in Wheeling, West Virginia, is planned for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can track Trump's customership in West Virginia below as a live stream at YouTube online.
Trump will probably respond to the hearings of the Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, on accusations of sexual misconduct that were conducted this week in an excited atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on confirmation remains up to a week in the sweep while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main objective of this survey series is to support Republicans who have to make a difficult election in November.
Consequently, President Trump's election team against Reuters stated that these five advertisements will serve the next week to mobilise volunteers and attendants, while the Republicans are trying to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and the representative house.
“The control of the Convention is so important for its plans that the President will travel in as many states as possible while the operational election season is near," said a Trump voter who did not want to call his name, Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling for the evening, an attendant from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and report media from Pittsburgh”.
The visit on Saturday is Trump's second visit this month in West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidates from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey.
“It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the President must come to try to drive him into the surveys,” said Simon Haeder, policeologist at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The team of the United States shows fighting willingness to maintain the hope for the individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the four parties may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed on Saturday afternoon.
The swinging pendel of the momentum as a sport concept is a pure invention, but one that the players really believe in, and that especially in competitions like this.
So where is the moment they think is now?
"They were in the leadership with six points, and now there are four, so I think that this means a little moment for us," said Jordan Spieth when leaving the playground.
Europe, of course, is in favour and lies four points ahead, while twelve more follow.
However, according to Spieth, the Americans feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which have played together all day and each can present three of four points.
Spieth was incrediblely strong from absorption to green and goes forward with a good example.
The good-tural enthusiasms were more loud in the course of his round when he sank an important poet to decide the fourth match with four points for both for themselves, after he and Thomas had relocated after two holes with two points.
His poet, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar cry that suggests that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"I really have to kneel in and take care of my own game," said Spieth.
That's all that the individual players remain.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have achieved more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days and have undoubtedly written the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's inequal, but sympathetic duo is at four of four points and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood” was not the only couple who had not slaughtered Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the back nine holes on Friday morning Bogeys.
This series and the apparently between them and the outdated amount of flowing energy supports that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players who conquer a possible European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Preferred both at the same time at different holes.
However, speaking of European fame would be early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia, the four hero of the morning who played with Alex Noren.
One Bogey and two doubles on the front of the nine holes brought the Spanish and Sweden into a clamp that they could not almost overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the bracket.
The four and four pairs are fascinating because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or do not give, and the way a strategy can change quickly, so fascinating from the close.
The Europeans have so far played better as a team and are clearly in leadership on the last day. However, this four round has also shown that the team of the United States is ready to fight, which some have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe goes in lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is located in front of the four and four parties from Saturday to the United States with 10:6 and goes with a solid spring in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The genius played Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went forward with two victories over the tiger Woods fighting and thus booked four points in Le Golf National.
The European team quoted by Thomas Bjørn, who wanted to recover the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the fours in the morning against the misplaying American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the four parties, the United States made more resistance and won two matches, but the remainder could not be recovered.
Jim Furik's team needed eight points in the 12 individuals played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points as the first European newling, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend, won four points only as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After slaughtering Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized excellently and struck the enthusiastic woods and the American newling Bryson Dechambeau with an even more profound 5&4.
Woods, who had slept through two matches on Saturday, sometimes made his brilliant light, but now 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in sequence.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played the four parties as a partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris did not go everything according to their ideas.
The three-fold major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the measuring chart for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
In the fours, they achieved a tough 2&1 victory over the Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter played for Spain and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3, after they had lost the first two holes.
In the history of Ryder Cup, it was only two times that a team came back after it had gone to the individual with a remaining of four points. However, as a title holder, Furik's team is a disagree to keep the trophy.
After they have only been on second place for two days, it doesn't look like they could start a counter attack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
On Saturday before the United Nations, North Korea's Foreign Minister said that continued sanctions would deepen their mistrust with the United States and, under these circumstances, the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho said to the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken important measures last year, for example, to stop nuclear and rocket tests, to degrade the nuclear test areas and to oblige itself not to increase nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We do not see any appropriate response from the United States,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not be able to resolute ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri confessed North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a “phase-wise” approach to denuclearisation, in which North Korea was rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed to be significant when it did not reject unilateral denuclearisation from the front, as it had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an official US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June. In this, Kim had assured to work on the “Denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump promised guarantees for the safety of North Korea.
North Korea aims at an official end of the Korea war led from 1950 to 1953, while the United States said that Pjöngyng had to give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposes demands for a relief of the strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is on "first denuclearisation" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve their goal by force and even against the "Declaration of the End of War", said Ri.
“The assumption that we can force sanctions into our knees is a brain pain of people who don’t know about us.
The problem is, however, that the continued sanctions will deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not refer to plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. Head of State had highlighted at the beginning of the week with the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korean Head of State Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea instead of the United States would be the other party in the denuclearisation question, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have resulted in this silence.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris spoke was enormously different from his speech last year when he said to the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target with North Korea's rocket on the continent of the United States, after “the wicked President” Trump Kim had called“ Raketenman” on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened the "voluntary destruction" of North Korea last year, praised Kim with the United Nations for his courage in terms of desolation, but he said that there was still much work to be done and that the sanctions had to remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timeframe for it: "Where it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pjöngyng for the steps taken.
However, on Thursday the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: “The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must, in any case, be strongly continued until we have achieved complete, final and verified denuclearisation.”
The Security Council has strengthened the sanctions against North Korea unanimously since 2006 to wipe out Pjöngs programmes for nuclear weapons and ballistic rockets financially.
Pompeo met Ri at the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said he would again visit Pjönjong next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, he said when he left from Pjöngyng that progress had been made to be accused of North Korea only about hours later, he made “gather-like demands”.
North Korea praised this month at a meeting with Moon, to degrade a rocket base and a nuclear complex when the United States took “accessive measures”.
He said that Kim told him that the ‘compliant measures’ sought were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in a course to sleep enough
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep during the basic study this year. This is a measure against the widespread macho culture to keep awake with caffeine and learn about it all night.
A scientist has found that students at the world's leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to watching themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, and he believes that it is the first course in the United States.
He was inspired to bring the course into life after he had held a lecture on the effects of sleep withdrawal on learning.
“On the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why do I know about it now, in my last year?’
According to her words, no one had ever told her how important sleep is. That surprised me." he said to The Telegraph.
The course for the first time this year explained to the students how the foundations of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve the general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor for Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after she had found that students suffered severe sleep loss during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, the students see the picture of a room in a living house and click on coffee bags, curtains, training shoes and books. They will receive information about the effect of coffee and light as well as on the effects of a lack of sleep on the sports performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep loss can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cancer.
Afterwards, they are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine by using a map of the university area with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change the conduct of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a "night layer" is still widespread, he said and added that modern technologies and the constantly growing pressure on students made the lack of sleep a growing problem.
To ensure adequate sleep, the “home weapon” of all students should be against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said. Furthermore, a weight gain could be avoided since sleep loss puts the brain into the famine mode, so that they were constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who was studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had proved one of his courses last year in Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push him to a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step all postgraduate students will be invited to complete a similar study programme before they start their study at the competition-oriented university.
According to Professor Czeisler’s recommendation, the students should be awakening for the sleeping time and the wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” that are based on electronic screens and LED lights and can bring the circadian rhythm out of the tact, which leads to problems with sleeping.
Livingston against Rangers 1:0: Menga-Tor forced Gerrards player
The Rangers lost another outward game when the hit of Dolly Menga for Steven Gerrard's unanimous team meant a 0:1 downfall at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to book her first outward victory since the 4:1-Triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holts team added Gerrard the first second defeat in 18 games as manager, so his team is back eight points behind the heart leading in the Ladbrokes Premiership with distance.
Menga met seven minutes before half-time, and the inspired ranks seemed to have no chance to compensate.
While the Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third place and lies only behind Hibernian at the Tordifferenz.
The Rangers are also threatening further trouble after the linen judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which Ayr overtake and reached the halffinal of Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, remained with the same 11 Livingston players who took the Heart a point last week, and must be enthusiastic as his well trained team held their opponents on step and Tritt under pressure.
Although the Rangers dominated the ball possession, Livingston reached more when they had the ball.
They should have reached a gate after just two minutes when Mengas' first charge led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregors Tor. However, the middle field player missed his chance and shot then.
Then a long release of Keaghan Jacobs reached the captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot over at the back of the patch.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that after a quarter of hour, he had had to have a penalty struggle between him and Steven Lawless, but arbitrary judge Steven Thomson did not apply the complaints of the Columbianer.
In the first half of the time, the Rangers only reached two ports, but the former Ibrox Torkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a shame shot by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's matches in the 34th minute may not match the game course, it is not to deny that they had earned it alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the rest and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted half-time and exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent. The change almost immediately showed effect when the wing player made Morelos position, but the impressive Kelly rushed from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued the guests to play exactly the game they're playing, while Lithgow and Halkett received a long ball after the other.
Holt's team could have expanded its leadership during the last phase, but McGregor kept standing well and defended Jacobs before Lithgow shot a headball out of the corner.
The Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also demanded a penaltiest after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geyer Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanach: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the beef counter.
Since then, the gey counter who became the standard element of science also became a standard element of pop culture, for example in the film "Bells of Coronado" of 1950 with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this in all the world?"
Rogers: “This is a gig counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "In fact, I hear a knock!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, the invention that wears his name continues to live.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” depleted cells
A new cancer vaccine can help the immune system to “see” and destroy depleted cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect deteriorated cells in the course of treatment.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient that are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a lot of common protein types and will then be injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovary cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect deteriorated cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient that are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” the many types of cancer common protein HER2. Then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 promotes the growth of various types of cancer, including breast, eggstock, lung and intestinal cancer, as explained by Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method in which patients are taken immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped to treat a leukaemia type.

It didn't work well.
Kanye West was buried out at Saturday Night Live in the studio after he had commended a widespread US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to join as presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, "Ghost Town", and carrying a Make-America-Great Agaïn cap, he continued with a shame canonade against the Democrats and again stressed his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by Whites, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s Rassist.’
So if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America for a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the mission with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood Star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate’s Judgment Committee to the accusations of sexual offense brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's Schimpftirade was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by the competitor Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of the publication about West.
West also complained to the audience that he had problems behind the stage because of his head coverage.
“They have shiculated me behind the stage.
They said, ‘Don't go out with the cap’.
You shyed me!
And then they say I'm in a distorted area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Would you see the distorted area?” He said he’s going to dress “my supermancape, because that means that you can’t tell me what I have to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love."
His comments triggered at least twice Buhrufe from the audience, and SNL co-operators were embarrassingly touched, reported Variety. One person said to the magazine: "It was dead silent in the studio."
West had been obliged to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
In West, many were confused with a lecture of the title "I Love it", where he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, director of the Conservative Group of TPUSA. She twittered: “On one of the most courageous spirits: Danke, DANKE, THAT YOU THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THE MASS."
The Talkshowmoderator Karen Hunter, however, twittered that the West was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes a ideology that is harmful to my community and gives of itself (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘Art’).
He's free.
The same applies to us." she added.
Before the broadcast, the Rapper had announced at Twitter that he had changed his name and now was "The Being formally known as Kanye West" (The officially known as Kanye West).
He is not the first artist who changes his name, and he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the dead musical teachers, changed his name in a symbol and then in “The Artist Formerly Known As Prince” (The former artist known as Prince).

“Game of Thrones” Star Kit Harington attacks toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword of violent Jon Snow in HBOs of forced medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones”.
The 31-year-old actor, however, attacked the stereotype of the Machoheld. He said that such roles on the screen would have resulted in that boys often felt to have to be strong to be respected.
In conversation with “The Sunday Times Culture” Harington said he believed that something had gone wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic maleness in the #Metoo age.
Harington, who recently also married the Rose of Thrones, also 31, acknowledged that the solution to the problem was "very important" to him.
“I personally find the question of what has been wrong with the male at present,” he said.
"What have we taught grown-up men about the problem that we are watching now?"
Harington believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxicity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught in the television and on the street that gives boys the feeling of having to embodie this certain side of a man?
I think that is really one of the major questions of our time: how do we change this?
For the young men have clearly gone a little wrong."
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series in the next summer he would not take part in prequels or sequels by "Game of Thrones". He had "good of battlefields and horses".
From November, Harington has been seen in a new edition by Sam Shepard's "True West", the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently told him that he was the best of "Game of Thrones" that he had met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife at this mission, so I have received my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie played in the great fantasy series of Ygritte, the lovers of Harington's Character Jon Snow.
The two married Leslies in Scotland in June 2018.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 only about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the transfer took place in most of the new cases by sex.
So far HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people in this way infected with HIV had been almost reduced to zero, Chinese health officials indicated at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, in the annual comparison, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The HIV transmission by sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated in China in 1997, however, the discrimination of members of the LGBT community should be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men finally marry women.
Many of the disease transfers are due to inadequate protection in the field of sex in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters contests that employees have transmitted the data of the GOP sensors, criticizes "threatening lies" and "consumption theorys"
Maxine Waters, Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, contests on Saturday that a member of her staff has published the personal information of three republikan US senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Members.
The Democrat of Los Angeles believed that the claims of “ultra-righted” experts and websites would be spread.
"Lyes, lies and even more disgusting lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is intended to include the private addresses and phone numbers of the US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday. They were published during the hearing of a Senate Committee on the accusations against the Supreme Curt candidates Brett Kavanaugh of sexual errors by an unknown person in the government quarter.
The publication took place after the three senators had consulted Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pondit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the contributions, was assigned to the Waters Office and published the information of a member of Waters’ Personal, reported The Hill.
“This unjustified accusation is totally wrong and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were threatened by these fraudulent and false accusations – was in no way responsible for transmitting this information.
This unjustified accusation is totally wrong and an absolute lie."
Waters’ declaration quickly triggered criticism online, including those of Ari Fleischer, an ex-pressive speaker of the White House.
"This dementi is angry," said meater.
“This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a Congress member.
People who are accused of something they have not done may not be angry.
You can't be detestable.
You must not question the motives of the complainant.
You must be calm and loose."
Meater seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of by critics to have angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who arrived at the half-time elections to dissolve waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great thing if that is true," he twittered.
Waters said in her statement that their office has informed the competent authorities and criminal prosecutors about these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the offenders are revealed,” she continued, “and that they will be taken into account for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous for all my staff’s members.”
Critical to “Johnny English – You live only three times” – weak spying parodie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to search for Brexit references in each new British colored film. This also seems to be true for this relivery of the action comodien parodie franchise “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spion, who was working it” and lived again in 2011 with “Johnny English – Now first right”.
Will an ironic self-parodie about the subject, how obviously we are, become a new export chance for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glotsy, gricy-cuting and incompetent Johnny English was extended for the second time for the mumbling. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for cinemas in the non-English-speaking space.
Of course, he is again the cracked secret agent, who bizarrely thinks cool and world-human, while in reality he has contributed to a little clouseau, a prize Mr. Bean and a cock of this guy, who has contributed to the opening of the Olympic Games in London at the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games, a single note on the title melodie of the “The Hour of the Victor”.
In addition, the figure was originally based on the chaos of travelers behind themselves and international secret agents, which Atkinson played in the past forgotten Barclaycard television spots.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor, and the redor leaves briefly pinched on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics occurs, but the humor seems quite weak and strangely overflowing, especially because the "serious" film series such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-safe comodiantic elements.
The humor appears to be more directed to children than to adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy miscreations are not as infallive and focused as Atkinson's stupid film gag in the role of Bean.
The eternal present premise is now that the United Kingdom is in great danger.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the supersecret British spying network and revealed the identity of all British agents in operation, very much to failure the serving agent, a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last strike for the Prime Minister, a blown and intimidated figure already standing before the complete collapse due to her political inappropriation: Emma Thompson gives her best with this Quasi-Teresa-May character, but the script does not give much for her to work with.
Their secret service advisers inform them that all the active spies have been distorted and therefore have to get someone out of the retirement.
This includes the tolpatchy Johnny English itself, who now works as a teacher in a postal institution, but there is unofficial lesson in the work as a undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a "School of Rock" academy for the memory of the "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall to an emergency meeting and reunited with his former severely tested Kumpan Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a U-boat commander, a nervous woman of the higher society in whose role Vicki Pepperdine has been scattered.
So Batman and Robin, who always make everything terrible wrong in your Majesty's secret service, are in action again. They meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerous in the ban of a charismatic Tech millionaire, the dark Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve the computer problems of the UK.
English and Bough start their Odyssee of the greatsque Spaces: When Kellner dressed, they put a nice French restaurant in fire, they provide chaos when they smuggle on board of Voltas luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy when he attempts to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house with a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence all registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny they are, the topic is already detailed in child television.
Very moderate substance.
As with the other Johnny-English films, I had to ask myself: “Can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not play a role that is really justified by his talent?"
Labour contests to work on a plan after which the British are to work four days a week but for five days to be paid
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is supposed to consider a radical plan that provides that the British work four days a week but pays for five days.
The party claims that business leaders will forward the savings achieved by the KI Revolution (Artificial Intelligence) in the form of an additional free day to the workers.
This would mean that the employees would have received a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same payment.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to move the balance in the country to the benefit of workers is "fixed".
The conversion to a four-day week was encouraged by the trade unions Union Congress as a possibility for workers to benefit from the benefits of the changing economy.
A high - level source from the Labour Party said to the Sunday Times: “There is expected to be a directive examination before the end of the year.
"A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort that is in line with the approach of the party to restore the economic balance for workers and with the general industrial policy strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first party that supports such an idea. Already the Green Party promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign 2017.
However, the approach is currently not supported by the Labour Party.
A speaker of the Labour Party announced: "In a four-day week it is not a party policy and it is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancell, John McDonnell, concreted his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to recover the power of "anonym directors" and "profitmakers" in public supply companies.
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water supply companies may not retain their entire share, as a labour government could take 'deductions' due to supposed misconducts.
It also confirmed the relevant plans to call workers in the boards of companies and to set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the private company's own capital to the employees who cash the annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say in the news magazine “60 minutes” whether the FBI's investigation could change their opinion in the case of Kavanaugh
The FBI investigation on the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has a final vote on his appointment as Judge at the Supreme Court of Justice for at least one week and raises the question whether the results of the Republican Senators' Authority could affect their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the 60 minute Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could show something, which could finally change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I told in the negotiation that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, that claim was expressed, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and incomprehensible."
Graham's voice, however, seems to be measured in stone.
“My opinion is firm as to Brett Kavanaugh, and there must be a bomb,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has fought this," Graham added and moved to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all they called couldn't confirm it."
It's now 36 years.
And I can't find any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has been helped to reduce poverty in the framework of this festival?
On Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival in New York takes place to fight poverty in the world with an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and a similarly impressive mission.
Tens of thousands will visit the Global Citizen Festival, which takes place this year for the seventh time, not only to experience the appearances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to strengthen consciousness for the actual goal of the event: the fight against extreme poverty until 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. In the context of this project, an international group of interests seeks to fight poverty by increasingly motivating people to participate actively in poverty fighting.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option to buy a VIP ticket) you need to complete a number of tasks. These include actions such as volunteer work, communication with a leading politician worldwide (e-mail or telephone) or similar measures to increase awareness of the goal – the fight against poverty.
How successful is the project when you think that Global Citizens remain 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of putting a cool free concert in view, a useful way to convince others that it is time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think to change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizens announced that the project has been able to carry out more than 19 million actions from its supporters since 2011 and achieve various goals.
These actions should have contributed to stimulating world-wide leading politicians to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group 390 cited commitments and announcements resulting from their actions, of which at least 10 billion US dollars have already been paid or received by fundraising.
According to the Group's estimates, the guaranteed funds have so far direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments are the project The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and implementers in the United Kingdom who have committed themselves to support children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million in fighting undernourage in the country after receiving more than 4.700 Tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the United Kingdom’s government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history”, the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, informed the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve the food situation of mothers and children, the government announced the financing of the project The Power of Nutrition, to achieve 5 million women and children and to provide food interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely the question of the reasons why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
they answered: “It will be a long and challenging way with heights and depths.
But similar to the major civil rights and anti-party movements before us, we will be successful, as we are together stronger and more influenced.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who are presenting this year's event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as modernists.
The United States could use the Marine for blockage purposes to prevent Russian energy exports – Ministry of Interior
According to Washington Examine, Washington can take back to the marine where necessary so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, the US Minister Ryan Zinke informed.
Zinke claimed that Russia's use in Syria is a prerequisite to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently working on the invitation of the legal government in these areas.
'I believe that the real reason for Russia's use in the Middle East is to negotiate new markets in energy, just as in Eastern Europe', he said.
And according to the official there are means and ways to deal with this.
“The United States, together with the Marine, can ensure that the sea roads remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market”, he informed.
Zinke addressed the participants in the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which is understood as the "stimm of the electricity consumers" in the United States.
He made a comparison between Washington's approaches in dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are practically identical.
"The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia," he said, while he referred to Russia as "One Trick Pony" with a economy depending on fossil fuels.
The statements were made when the government under Trump was in order to expand the export of liquid gas to Europe and thus replace Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including US President Donald Trump, try to convince Germany to withdraw from the “unadjusted” pipeline project Nord Stream 2 which, according to Trump Berlin, became the “fänge” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2-Pipeline value of $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusive economic project.
The Kreml argues that Washington's massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all believe that energy should not be used as means of exercising pressure and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves,” said Russian Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has received opposition from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the German Industry Federal Association (BDI), has invited the United States to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral contracts between Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a major problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," the BDI Dieter Kempf board comments after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Wladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “reasonably” a presidential candidate in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts.
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would "check out" a presidential candidate after the interim elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she considered a candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which includes women at the top.
Warren intends to examine a candidate for the Presidency after 6 November.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump leads this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy,” she said.
Warren, when criticizing Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court, did not take a leave before the mouth.
In a Tweet on Friday, she announced that before the vote, of course, a FBI investigation is necessary.
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe that it should be able to administer for 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe survey, 58 percent of the potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not be able to change.
32 percent of the voters supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for a candidate of the former governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent who support a potential candidate and 48 percent who are opposed to it.
Among the further names of prominent Democrats, which are in question with regard to a possible candidate in 2020, the former Vice President Joe Biden and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden announced that he would decide officially until January.
Sarah Palin expresses himself on the Donald Trump-Ralley to posttraumatic load disorder under track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged for domestic violence on Monday evening.
“What my son experiences when he comes back, which can reflect everything other families who feel the effects of the PTBS and some of the wounds with which our soldiers return,” she told the audience at a Ralley for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to his arrest as "Elefant in the room" and said about her son and other war veterans that they were coming back changing that they were coming back, and wondering if there was this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military gave to the country.
On Monday he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of a woman for domestic violence, so Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police authority of Wasilla.
18 States and D.C. support a legal aid for new asylum policy
18 States and the district of Columbia support a legal aid to the new US policy which refuses victims of bandage activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a court expert declaration in Washington on Friday to support an asylum applicant who questions the policy, NBC News reported.
The complete name of the applicant in the Grace-gen sessions complaint, which the American Civil Liberties Union submitted in August against the Federal Policy, was not announced.
She announced that her partner “and his violent band sons” abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace referred to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people make an application for asylum in the United States, as nations who are dealing with major problems with criminal bands and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy suspended a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals of 2014 which allowed illegal immigrants to apply for asylum on the flight from domestic violence.
In a statement on Friday, Karl Racine, the General Federal Lawyer of Columbia said that the new policy “decades of legislation ignores at state, federal and international level”.
"The Bundesgesetz prescribes that all asylum applications are assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application and that court violates this principle," was stated in the Judge Declaration.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy that immigrants refuse access to the country is inappropriate to the economy in the United States, as immigrants could be more entrepreneurs and could provide the necessary labour forces.
In June, the General Federal Advocate Jeff Sessions ordered that immigrant judges who flee from domestic violence and the violence of criminal bands would no longer give asylum.
"Asyl exists for all who leave their home country because they are persecuted or because of fears of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political conviction," said sessions in its announcement of the policy of 11 June.
It was never the plan to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems with which people have to fight every day around the world.
Destroyed rescue attempts in Palu, as the number of death sacrifices in the race doubles with time
The situation was increasingly worse for the survivors.
“It’s all very excited,” says the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma and rests her little fiery son in a rescue centre in the destroyed city of Palu.
“ Every minute a new car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Inhabitants returned to their ruined houses to gather their nests of possession and good and to mountain everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the hospital staff damaged by the earthquake with the strength of 7.5 were totally overloaded.
Some of the injured ones, including Dwi Haris, who went to wrestling breachs and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu military hospital, where patients in the outdoor areas were treated due to the persistent strong survivals.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the intense earthquake shake the hotel room in the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“All things went too fast.
I think I was knocked into the walls,” he reported the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s calls for help, but then I was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my child.
I can only hope they're in a safe place."
U.S. messenger accuses China of Tyrannei with “propaganda advertisements”
One week after an official Chinese newspaper had made a four-sided ad in an American daily newspaper in which the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China were announced, the U.S. messenger in China accused the country capital of Beijing to exploit the American press for progaganda purposes.
The United States Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily's paid contribution in the Des Moine's Register, the most sold magazine in Iowa, after he accused China to intervene in the United States Congress Elections on 6 November, an accusation contested by China.
Trump's accusations that Beijing tried to interfere with the US valleys are in line with the communication of U.S. officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign, which is triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to make advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an outrageous trade war, with customs duties on imports for both countries.
The Chinese remuneration duties at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in countries such as Iowa who supported the Republican Party by Trump, said Chinese and US experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. messenger in China and former long-term governor of Iowa, who exports largely of agricultural products to China, announced that Peking workers, owners of farms and companies have damaged them.
China, so Branstad, in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, now doubles these Tyrannei by switching propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
“With the spread of their propaganda, the Chinese government claims the best practice of freedom of expression and the independent press in America by switching the country paid advertising into the Moines Register,” wrote Branstad.
“In contrast, you will find only in a limited number of oppositions to the newspaper skies here in Beijing and do not find any real reflection of the different opinions that Chinese could have on China’s disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media are firm in the hand of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that one of China's most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but he did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans prescribe voters before the interim elections with the debakel around Kavanaugh, warn observers
Since many of the most influential Republicans support and defend the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in view of several accusations of sexual violence, observers have warned against a reaction during the present interim elections, which could be particularly from women.
The vote in this context was extremely excited, and most Republicans have already stated that they continue with a vote.
Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University The Hill, announced a article published on Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubted that the load-minute precursion of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was sufficient for a FBI investigation to reduce angry voters.
"Women don't forget what was yesterday, they don't forget it tomorrow and even in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the newspaper in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called in the river area of the Senate "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who control the Justice Committee, decided to hold on the nomination of Kavanaughs and reported that despite the statement of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, told Stu Rothenberg, an unpartial political observer of the news page.
“The people say it's already high, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially for voters in the premises and younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they do not like the President, often do not choose."
Even before the public statement of Ford, in which its accusations of the sexual attack against the applicants of the Supreme Court are detailed, observers indicated that a counter-reaction could be the result if the Republicans were proposing the confirmation.
“This situation is a violent controversy for the GOP”, said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, in the beginning of the last week,” says NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the body, the final vote or the review of Kavanaughs; it is also the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated it," said Guy Cecil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be disagreed with who they should believe because of the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly greater share on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of the respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford's statement, while 35% indicated that they gave definite or probably Kavanaugh faith.
38% also indicated that they believed that Kavanaugh had probably lied to or definitely in his statement, while 30% indicated the same about Ford.
After the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations brought by Ford and at least one other applicant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford gave last week before the Senate’s Judgment Committee an idle statement that she was attacked by the drunk Kavanaugh at the age of 17 years.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court had blown her gentiles to her when she was at a party during her study period in Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, currently brings a startup to the market with the aim of establishing a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology-leading, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to select where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee gave the best that the intent behind inrupt was the "Weltherrschaft".
"We have to become active now," he said on startup.
"It is a historical moment."
The app uses Solid's technology so that users can create their own personal data store or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library as well as other tools for the private and business sector.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content in a browser are available at the same time.
The special in the personal online data storage is that the user can decide who to access the data alone.
The company refers to this concept as personal strengthening and development of data.
According to CEO of the company John Bruce, the idea behind inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes and appropriate skills so that Solid can be available for all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers who have been set up for the work on this project, as well as a Community voluntary programmer. Furthermore, a security platform acquired by IBM will be used.
Starting this week, technology developers can create their own decentralised apps worldwide with the tools available on the inrupt website.
Berners-Lee notified that he and his team will not exchange with Facebook and Google about whether a comprehensive change is to be made, in which all their business models are completely transformed overnight.
"We do not ask for their permission."
In a contribution to the medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy production and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solidly based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee provided a reconstruction of the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been significantly involved in the debate on network neutrality.
Even with the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely confident about this new era of the web," he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, carryer of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded as a fighter with the Viktoria Cross during World War I, was honored 100 years later in his home city.
Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a shake shooter and never learned that he had won the highest British war mark.
His two grandsons revealed a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the hero, for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Oberstleutnant Vann conducted his Bataillon on September 29, 1918 through the Canal de Saint-Quentin; by thick nobles and under a severe shot of field canons and machine guns.
Later he pushed to the fire line and led the line forward with the “greast braveness” before he speeded up with a field weapon in the single entrance and switched out three of the military units.
Colonel Vann was shot on October 4, 1918 by a German shooter; a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the deeds of his grandfather were something he could never be justified, and at the same time something that makes one humble.
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid a crown after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he feels very honored to be able to participate in the parade and added that the courage of a real hero would be visible especially by the support of many people.
MMA fans have been awake all night to watch Bellator 206 instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed awake all night to see a exciting bellator 206 and then you can't see the main event.
The invoice of San Jose contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the United Kingdom to Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock then, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, the viewers in the United Kingdom were not surprised when suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained unroused after staying awake to the early morning hours to see the fight in particular.
A fan described on Twitter the switch to the trick film figure as a somewhat bad joke.
“On the basis of a regulation by the Government, these content will be classified as not youth-free, so that at 6 o'clock it had to be changed to a child's broadcasting,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President in the Marketing and Communication area of Bellator when he was asked for the transfer.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
The Executive Board of Bellator, Scott Coker, informed that the company will edit the run-up plan to take into account viewers from the United Kingdom in the future.
“I think that the problem could already be solved in the repetition game,” he said.
“But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday with the viewers in the United Kingdom, and we will not solve the event until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stay there.
It was quite a lot communicated during the change. It was quite nice and it wasn't always nice.
We have tried to solve the problem, and we have assumed that it is a technical disorder.
What was not the case, it was a problem from the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will reduce the whole to 5 instead of 6 fights, as in normal case, and we have tried to offer the fans the best possible experiences.
The whole situation is quite unfortunate."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “defeated” on the subject of sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated in various Olympic games as a springer, says that he has grown up with the feeling of being subject to all others because of his sexuality. But this feeling had motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized in the secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said that he spoke on the subject of homosexual rights to encourage others.
He also thought that since he became a father, the victory in the Olympic games is no longer so important for him.
The actual leader of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses the disease condition for a few months.
In Laverne's first mission, he said he had previously regarded himself as disadvantaged compared to others, since love for boys and girls was socially completely inappropriate.
He said: “To this day, the feeling of being submissive and different from the others is the reason for my power and strength, and finally for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality to disappoint no one when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-fold bronze medal winner in the Olympic Games is today a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to promote the decriminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said that he spoke about this subject because he luckily could live without restrictions and without discrimination and want to encourage others.
The three-fold world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The knowledge of being in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
In the previous year, Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner, but he shared that the age difference was never a topic.
As a child and a youth, he thinks that if you had to go through so much – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first 14 time and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in the same age with similar experiences.
Since June, the couple has had a son who has the name Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley believes that his entire vision has changed since.
Last year, he'd have turned everything around gold medals.
But for him there are now more important than Olympia Gold Medals.
His son Robbie is now his main win.
He wears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after the diagnosis of the brain tumor.
Daley said that his father did not accept the nearest death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London in 2012, as he wanted to be in front of it.
"I couldn't tell him that he would no longer be there," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only afterwards I finally realized that he is not invincible,” he continued.
In 2012, Daley won the bronze medal in the Olympic Games.
“I just knew it was always my dream of dying before a homely audience in Olympic games,” he said.
His first selection of songs – proud of Heather Small – was also influenced. He heard the song in the front of the Olympic Games and still cared for gänsehut.

Mickelson, which is not currently in shape, sits at Ryder Cup on Saturday on the replacement bank
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he must strive very much so that the whole thing will not become a debakel.
Mickelson, who plays at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the replacement bank by Captain Jim Furik for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing at the centre of the event, the five-fold Major Victor spent his day in hiring others and working on his game, in the hope of resolving the problems that burden him.
Even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus no ideal occupyment for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misleading balls are regularly punished.
And as if the place wasn't even discouraging enough, Mickelson meets the perfectionist British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined Tommy Fleetwood, newling in these tournaments, in the ninth game on Sunday to win all four games this week.
If the Americans have four points back at the 12 single games, then Mickelson's game could prove absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
“He was perfectly clear about his present role, gave me a lap on my back and put his arm around me and meant he's ready for tomorrow,” said Furik.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He belongs to the world-known personalities and has done so much in the past and this week for these teams.
I hadn't thought he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that's how it went and that's what we expected.
He wants to be involved as everyone else."
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldos record for most Ryder Cup games performed on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup track that never matched all the peaks of his personal record.
Mickelson can see 18 victories, had to sign down 20 deposits and reached seven half-times, although Furik announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He is funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few spices, and he is a great person who is popular with the whole team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to meet him a little closer this week. It was fun to watch them.
He is a really interesting person that gives many impulses."
Captain Thomas Bjørn knows that it can be over with the spring soon
Thomas Bjørn, Captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great precursor that leads to the last single games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team of Seve Ballesteros had five points toward the Americans, but barely came over the target line and took the leadership with the smallest possible leadership, with a victory of 141⁄2–131⁄2.
“The thought remains that we had a great spring in Valderrama, we had a great spring in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that is just a little," said Bjørn (figured on the picture), after he had seen the victory of the Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it's not over.
Tomorrow's going right.
Put yourself in the stuff and do exactly the right thing.
The whole thing is over only when the points are on the display table.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and there is our focus.
I've always said I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we are fully aware of what stands against us on the other side: the best players in the world."
Happy about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overcome that.
Tomorrow another caliber is going to be.
Tomorrow the individual services are at the forefront and that is a completely different thing.
It's great to work with a partner when things go well, but if you're alone out there, you'll be tested to the limits of your skills as golfers.
This must be made clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he also needs to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furik will be careful that his players are better cut off individually than in the team, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three of four points.
Furik himself stood on both sides of that big turning on the last tournament day. He stood in Brookline on the winner side before he stood on the sides of the losers after Europe's "wonder of Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word," he answered the question like Ben Crenshaw, Captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start you've seen in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum strikes in a direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our boys out as we feel, you know, we're trying to magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of retrieving the countervailing, he must join the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the upper half of the ranking list.
"I have decided for the boys in this order, as I think it covers everything," said Bjorn about his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's new warship is delayed again
The latest fregate of the German Marine should have been put in service in 2014 to replace warships coming in the years from the time of the Cold War. However, according to local media, it is delivered only early next year, due to defective systems and rapidly rising costs.
The entry into force of the ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the headship of the brand new Fregatten of the ‘Baden-Württemberg’ class, was now moved to the first half of 2019, according to the time called on a military speaker.
The ship should have been put in service in 2014, but the ambitious project of disturbing problems has been plagued after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were already ordered by the Marine in 2007, are to replace the old fregates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a number of flight guns and sea target aircraft, as well as tarn technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflexion.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest fregattes do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the persistent delays may lead to the ageing of the high-modern war vessels that Germany is supposed to represent as a marine force at the time of their inclusion, says The Time.
The Fregatte F125 followed by the accident last year came into the headlines when the German Marine officially refused to take off the ship and returned to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Marine returned a ship after its delivery to the ship.
There was little known about the reasons for returning, but German media mentioned a number of significant “software and hardware errors” that would have made the new ship unusable in a fighting situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are used by a crew of only 120 matroses, only about half as many as on the older fregats of the Bremen class.
It was also known that the ship is too difficult, which leads to performance damage and prevents the marine from carrying out renovation measures in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of heavy Rhineland-Pfalz seemed to be twice as heavy as ships with a similar class used by Germany during the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the costs of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, have also become a problem.
Apparently, the costs increased to a stunning €3.1 billion compared to the €2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest fregates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's marine power is crumbling.
At the beginning of the year, Hans-Peter Bartels, warrior of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the Marine was “out of the capable vessels”.
Bartels said that the problem grew up with time, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the fregats of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Marine.
National Trust listens to the secret life of the Fledermuses
New research work is being carried out in a site in the Scottish Highlands to show how Fledermuse uses the landscape in the search for food.
It is hoped that the results will allow further insight into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to lead future natural protection activities.
The study carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will explore dwarf and moulded leather mice as well as the brown longhorn and water leather mice in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are set up at key positions on the property to record the activities of the Fledermuses throughout the season.
Employers of the NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a sound analysis of all the recordings by experts, the frequency of the Flederm calls is determined and the species is determined.
Afterwards, a map and a report of the habitat is drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Protection Adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will show the areas of the living room are most important for the Fledermuses and how they are used by each species.
These data will help to determine the advantages of measures to manage the habitat, such as the creation of wheat, and to show how to obtain forest areas for Fledermuses and other related species.
The Flederm stocks in Scotland and the entire United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping places and leads to loss of living space.
Wind wheels and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as flyers and chemical treatment of construction materials or attacks by house cats.
Fledermuses aren't really blind.
However, their ears are more useful because of their nightly hunting habits than their eyes when it comes to catching belts.
They use a delicate equation to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the topic of the Fledermuse very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct investigations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only fledermuit reserve in the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home for eight of Scotland's 10 fledermauszies.
Guarantee Manager David Thompson explains that the presence is the ideal living room for them.
"Here in Threave we have a great area for Fledermuse," he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent living area.
But there are many things we do not know about Fledermuses, so we do these work here and on other goods that will help us to learn more about what Fledermuses need to feel well."
He emphasizes the importance of killing up to 400 females and virgins before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the unwilling destruction of a single nestplace could kill up to 400 females and virgins and eliminate the entire population on site.
Fledermuses are under protection and it is illegal to kill them, plague them or destroy them or their nesting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, schottian officer of Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to assist.
She explains: “We still have to learn a lot about Fledermuses, and in many of our species we do not know how it is about their populations.”
Ronaldo deprives rape proposals while his lawyers want to accuse the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo referred to rape claims against him as "Fake News" and said that people want to be "famous" by using his name.
His lawyers plan to charge the news magazine The mirror that published the charges.
The storm of the Portugal National Team and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
He claimed to pay her $375,000 to buy her silence to the event, said The Mirror on Friday.
In an instagram live video to his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports only hours after their publication as "Fake News".
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News," said the five-time winner of the ballon d’Or to the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous with my name, but this is part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is good," added the player smiled.
Mr Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to charge the mirror on the basis of the accusations they claimed, according to Reuters, as "inappropriate reporting on suspects in the field of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player demanded a compensation for “moral damage in a height that corresponds to the gravity of infringement, which probably represents one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The supposed incident should have occurred in 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga claimed to have raped them anally in the player's room, where they were reported to have been raped at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to the knee after the supposed incident and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy", which was the "a percentage".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but say it had been unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had been able to make photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later came to an extrajudicial agreement, since she had “angst of remuneration” and was concerned to be ‘degraded publicly’.
The 34-year-old said that she is now trying to cancel the agreement, as it was still traumatized because of the claimed incident.
Ronaldo was short to change from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the supposed incident and switched this summer into a 100 million euro heavy deal to the Italian Giant Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would ‘repently’ the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would “everlastingly regret it” if it, after the Brexit, lost its status as a global leading manufacturer of cars, says Greg Clark.
He continued that it was “anging” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would prematurely interrupt production in Burnaston at Derby, the UK should leave the EU.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese automotive manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border on a non-deal brexit could lead to the loss of jobs.
The work in Burnaston, where Toyota's Product Lines Auris and Avensis are produced, finished almost 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will experience production stops in our work at an uncontrolled Brexit end of March,” says Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s manager in Burnaston.
Other British automotive manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also caused fears of a harsh EU exit without agreement and its influence on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says that it will close his mini work in Oxford after the Brexit for one month.
The main ideas, according to the automotive manufacturers, are associated with risks within the supply chain at a hard Brexit.
Toyota's production system is operated on a “Just-in-Time” base. This means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the United Kingdom and the EU to make the cars on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, the limits could be interrupted which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortcomings in the parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to carry a stock stock in Derbyshire in the work, which was more than one day, the company explained why the production had to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa Mays Chequers Plan on future relations with the EU “is designed to avoid such controls at the border”.
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that, as I said, enables us not only to enjoy the current success but also to take this opportunity,” he explained in the broadcast Today of the BBC Radio 4.
"The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far."
Toyota could not indicate how long the production had to be interrupted, but long-term warned that additional costs would reduce the work's competitiveness and eventually lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been busy in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest functioner of the Unite trade union, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “My experience never comes back once they are gone.
A government speaker said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trumps planned meeting with Rosenstein could be re-disposed according to the White House's information
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Vice-President of Justice Rod Rosenstein could be postponed “a further week” while the dispute about the candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, said on Sunday from the White House.
Rosenstein has examined the supervision of the work of the special mediator Robert Mueller, who examined the election interferences by Russia, connections between Trumps Consultants and Russia, as well as possible legal disability by the President.
The question whether Trump fires the Vice-President and thus threatens Mueller's independence has been subject to rumours in Washington for a month.
At the beginning of the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of a secret recording of his conversations with Trump and the President's office with the 25th Constitution supplement.
Rosenstein demented the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his suspicious withdrawal were announced.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced at that time at the UN General Assembly in New York for the next Thursday,
Trump explained that he would not prefer to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to prevent it from colliding with the hearing before the US Senate’s Justice Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, declared.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the presumptions against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trumps press speaker Sarah Sanders was published on Fox News on Sunday.
On a question of meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been fixed. It could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed for another week, in view of all the things that are just going on with the Supreme Court.
That will show you, but I always like to keep the press on the run."
Some reporters would probably contradict this statement: Sanders has no longer held a press conference of the White House since 10 September.
Mother Chris Wallace asked her for the reason.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of press conferences does not play in a refusal to the “effective hashing” of the TV reporter, but confessed: “I wouldn’t disregard that they operate effective hashing.”
She then claimed that the direct contact between Trump and the press will grow.
The President makes more questions and reply rounds than any President before him," she said without precise evidence: "We have viewed these figures."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders, but it should be, “if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, but far better than to speak to me.
We are often trying to do this, and you have seen that we have done this many times in the last few weeks. This will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions if he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visitors.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the President may have shown why this is the case when he dismissed a bizarre and sometimes bizarre appearance from the robbery.
The Minister for Health writes on the Brexit memory of EU workers of the Scottish NHS
The Minister for Health addresses people from the EU foreigners who work in Scotland's National Health Service (NHS) to express the country's gratitude and to express the desire that they stay in the country after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom exited from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already declared itself willing to pay the costs of applications for residence titles for EU citizens working in the decentralised public service of Scotland.
In your letter, Freeman wrote: “In the course of the summer, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued, and decisions are expected to be made for this autumn.
However, the British Government has also strengthened the preparations for a possible non-deal scenario.
I am aware of the alarming times this must be for you all.
That is why I wanted to express again how much I value the contribution of each and every person who is working, regardless of nationality.
Members and colleagues from all over the EU and also bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie was undertaken after a head injuries of an emergency surgery
The line backer of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, was undertaken an emergency surgery on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, Chief Coach of Tennessee State, explained that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
“He came to the side line and just collapsed there,” said Reed.
Trainer and medical staff provided Abercrombie on the side line with oxygen before he was put on a carry and transported for further investigations.
A speaker of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie left the OP in Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details of the nature or extent of the injury” are known and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Butcrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays at Tennessee State in his first season after switching from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 thankles, thus rising his total number to 18 thankles during the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for real estate purchases in the United Kingdom
In the future, investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom. The additional revenues will benefit from the new plans of the Conservative Party.
This step aims to end the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp fee will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance calculates up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy properties in the United Kingdom, with more revenues to benefit homeless people.
This step represents an attempt to reduce Jeremy Corbyn's success with young voters who promise to provide more affordable living room and take top earners in the vision.
The increase in stamp tax is charged on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenues will be added to the government campaign against homelessness.
In addition to the current stamp tax and including the two-year increase in two-two apartments and the rent of lodged residential houses, it may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance calculates by the step up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by investors who are not resident in the United Kingdom. This drives prices to the height and it will be more difficult for first-time buyers to take foot in the real estate business.
Many prosperous areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “geist cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the United Kingdom.
The new strategy follows only a few weeks after Boris Johnson has spoken for a reduction in stamp taxes to allow more young people to have the first home.
He accused construction firms to keep the real estate prices by buying land without using it and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable apartments to end the UK 'Wohnraumschande'.
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a spectacular series of proposals for living room reforms, which are sufficient from a rental price bond to the prohibition of spaces without a good reason.
He also wants to give city councils more powers in building new apartments.
May explained: “Last year I said that I would devote my time to the restoration of the British dream, according to which the life of generation to generation should be improved.
And that means repairing our ruined housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build up a life.
However, it can not be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in Britain as well as for companies with a foreign seat to buy real estate as for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of the home has become too far for too many people, and the unworthiness of homelessness remains a too big problem."
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says that it is his “great goal” to become the manager of the Scottish team at some time.
The 42-year-old castle enjoys the challenge of hooking up the club from the north-east England's new life, which is just on the third place in the League One and lacking the three points at the top.
He moved this summer to the stage of Light after he brought St. Mirren back to the first Scottish League during the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it on the bank and that was 's'," Ross told the BBC Scotland broadcasting sound.
“But as a child I have often seen Scotland play in Hampden with my father, and this is something that always draws me back.
However, this option would only come if I was successful in the association management."
Ross predecessors in the role of Sunderland include Dock Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic claimed not to be afraid of walking into such etablier names at such a club after he previously rejected offerings from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The success will now be measured by me whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and the possibilities in this association, he is no doubt a member of the Premier League," he explained.
"It is not a easy task to get him there, but I would probably only appreciate my time here as a success if I brought the association back there."
Ross can present a three-year management career, after a phase as a vice-chairman at Dumbarton and a 15-month activity as a trainer in Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the delegation to the third League and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the delegation to win the mastership during the following season.
Ross says he feels better than ever in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“This was probably a real breakway,” he recalls when he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really believe that management was the right thing for me, more than to play.
It sounds funny because I didn't have a bad job, could live well, and experienced some very pleasant high phases.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still do this in terms of stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I've done it. I've never felt so well in my skin all my life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 17:30 a.m., so a study
The heat wave in summer has missed the revenues of British crippling pubs, while restaurant chains were under greater pressure.
In July, Pub and Bar companies recorded a turnover growth of 2.7 per cent. However, the revenues from restaurants decrease by 4.8 per cent according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the CGA company consultant, who compiled the figures, explained: “The persistent sunshine and England’s continuing participation in the soccer world championship meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous June, in which Pub’s turnover increases of 2.8 percent could be recorded.
The fall of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with focus on beverages showed with distance the best performance, with a surface-recovered turnover development, which increased higher than they sank at restaurants.
Pubs with focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastic as the restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go to a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, drink turnover increased by 6.6 per cent in the month, while food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, of the analysts for the RSM recreational and restaurant industry, stated: “These results continue the trend that we have been able to observe since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sports events remains the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-Home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight with problems, but sales of 4.8 per cent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer for operators of companies with focus on food could not have arrived at a worse time and it remains to wait for the more damaging temperatures in August to provide the urgently needed atempouts."
The overall turnover growth for pubs and restaurants, including the new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July and reflected the decline in the trademark rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyses performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognised industry benchmark.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that hide it from his parents
One study shows that every fifth child, some just 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that keep it secret from parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools has found an increase in so-called "Fake Insta" pages
The message fires fears that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students said to have a "head account" to show it to their parents.
One of five children, some just 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that can keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called "Fake Insta" accounts, a reference to the Photo Sharing website Instagram.
The message fires fears that sexual content is shared.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have a clean “head account” which they can show their parents, but also to have private accounts.
One mother, who struck on the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, found a teenager who invited others to “rape me.”
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, with the half of which admitted to own private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Chairman of the HMC, explained: “It is stunning that so many teenagers are enticed to create online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be “Stimm of the athletes” in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected at his annual General Assembly as a non-executive member of the Council of the Scottish Light Atletics-Dachverband Scottish Athletics.
Doyle is Scotland's most excellent athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sporters to benefit from their extensive international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is respected in Scotland, Great Britain and the world in the light athletics community, and we are sure that light athletics in Scotland would benefit very much from their choice in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I look forward to working as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 meters at the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996, called four Olympic Gold Medal its own and today often appears as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a transient bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't run anymore.
The doctors say nobody can say whether or how far I'm being cured.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and to do motion exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps comparing mothers with cows provides excitement in the network
A producer of milk pumps was excited in the network with an advertisement, where breast-feeding mothers are compared with the milking of cows.
For the introduction of the market of the ‘first-sounded milk pump’, according to its own claim, the manufacturers of consumer technology Elvie publish a non-serious music video to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a shine filled with hooe with cows in the background of a song that contains text lines like: “Yes, I milk me, but you don't see a dick at me” or “if you have not noticed it, these are not eagles but my breasts.”
The refrain continues: “Push it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising published on the Facebook page of the company has caused a controversy in the network.
With 77,000 accesses and hundreds of comments, the video was based on mixed reactions in the audiences, many of which say that it is harmless of the "schrecken" of the milk industry.
“It was a very bad decision to apply this product with cows.
As we do, they need to get drunk and bear a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their boys are taken away within few days after birth," said a comment.
The milk pump of Elvie fits down into a still BH (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: “Mamma and baby are traumatic.
But why don't we use it to apply a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another person added: "Such a realistic advertisement."
Others defended the advertising and a woman admitted that you found the song “urcomic”.
“I think that is a brilliant idea.
I would've bought one if I was still breast-feeding.
When I pumped off, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpretate it.
This is a genius product," wrote one person.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement that is directed to mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or toilets) and feel like “cows”.
This is not an advertisement for or against the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone has danced with the discrete pumps in their BHs.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who use milk pumps indicate to feel like milk cows.
However, the pump of Elvie is totally noiseless, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly into a still-BH, allowing women to move, keep their babies or even go out during the pump process.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother explained: “The pump of Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserved a expected and provocative market introduction.
By comparing breast-feeding mothers with milk cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges associated with that, while at the same time presenting the incredible sense of freedom that enables the new pump.
This is not the first time the pump of Elvie came into the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a double mother on the Catwalk appeared for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were brought silently and quietly to a tent city near the Texan border
The number of internal migrant children is as high as never before, although the number of monthly crossings has remained relatively equal, including since intensified rhetorics and measures of the Trump government have made it more difficult to place children in the career.
Traditionally, most maintainers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become the target disc for an exhibit when they are reporting to take a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential maintainers and other adult members of their households had to give their fingerprints and share these data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high official of the customs authority, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared before the convention that the authority arrested dozens of people who had acquired care for unaccompanyed minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no previous records in the criminal register.
“At most 80 percent of persons who are either maintainers or members of a household of a maintainer are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we will continue to persecute these people," explained Albence.
In order to handle the children's cases faster, the officials introduced new rules which, according to employees of the accommodation in some children, require to appear before court within a month rather than 60 days after the inventory, what was the standard before.
Many will appear by video switching and not by personal means to join an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the case of negative decision-making, the person will be suspended quickly.
The longer these children stay safe, the more likely it is, according to the information of the accommodation staff, as well as reports known from the system in the last month that they are worried and depressed, which may lead to violent outbreaks or outbreak attempts.
Defenders say that these concerns are strengthened in a larger facility such as Tornillo, since there are signs that a child has problems is easier to overlook because of the size.
They also explained that Traumata, many of the children already suffering, could be strengthened if they were brought into a tent city without emotional preparation or enough time to adopt friends.
Syria urges American, French and Turkish ‘besatzungstruppen’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Moualem, also vice-premier minister, explained that the foreign forces are illegally founded on Syrian ground with the presumption of the fight against terrorism and are treated accordingly.
“You have to withdraw immediately and without preconditions,” he explained to the congregation.
Moualem claimed that the "Krieg against terrorism" was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011 and millions more were displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus “will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleaned up” by both terrorist groups and “every illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has stationed about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly trained and advised both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soil troops in the war-built country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem explained that the conditions for their return were given and accused of “a few Western countries” to spread“ irrational anxiety” to prevent refugees from going home.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to allow return," he explained.
'They are actually politicsing a pure humanitarian matter.'
The United States and the European Union warned that there would be no building aid for Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and Opposition to end the war.
Diplomates of the UN explained that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last big rebel hochburg Idlib provides the opportunity to promote political discussions.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a wide range of openness of Syrian forces supported by Russia to the province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem emphasized that the agreement had 'clear deadlines' and expressed his hope that military measures against Djihadists, including fighters of the Nusra front that is "extinct" with Al-Qaeda, would be carried out.
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to call on the first meeting of a new committee that consists of government and opposition members to designate a post-war constitution for Syria and to set up the way to elections.
Moualem called the Syrian Government's conditions for participation in the Committee and stated that its work should be limited to the 'reworking of the articles of the current Constitution' and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win his re-select
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, as many liberal audiences probably hope to finish his presidency early.
This would undoubtedly be 'the most dramatic final of a presidency of all times'.
There has been no evidence that the spectators have been tired.
Since 2014, CNN's turnover rates have increased to 1.05 million more than doubled and almost threefolded to 1.6 million in MSNBC at the best time.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reaches an average of 2.4 million spectators at the best time of sending, compared to 1.7 million years ago. MSNBCs “The Rachel Maddow Show” resulted in a number of 3.5 million spectators at evenings with important news.
“This is like a fire that draws people magically, as it is something we don’t understand,” says Neal Bear, showrunner of the drama series ‘Designated Survivor’ on the TV broadcaster ABC over a cabinet member, which will be the president after an attack destroyed the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an ancient comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the election in 2016.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘because he brings me to laugh’”” told Scovell.
The chaos is worth entertainment.
Of course, the history of Washington, in contrast to all that is to be found in television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortion Roe v. Wade, the possible fusion of families and the health of the global economy.
The shutdown is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet, it is a informed citizen to be aware of having already watched six hours of an expert round, which discusses about Bob Woodward's use of sources from the so-called "Deep Background" for his book "Fear", Paul Manaforts 15,000 dollars expensive bomberjacket from radiant leather (as stated in Washington Post, a "dress rich in self-evaluation") or the effects of Stormy Daniel's rhythmical description of Trumps, em, anatomy.
I will never see Super Mario again with the same eyes for my part.
“Part of what he does, it can feel like a reality show that he is presenting every evening,” says Brent Montgomery, the main business leader of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the series “The Three of the Pfandhaus”, about Trumps rotating occupyment and daily action applications (breaking a fight with the Football League NFL from the Zaun, commending Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a result, or you don't come with me anymore.
When I reached Fleiss this week, there were sunny 27 degrees in front of his house at the northern coast of the Hawaiian island Kauai, but he cracked inside and looked at MSNBC while he recorded CNN at the same time.
He could simply not dissolve himself from the screen, not when Judge Candidate Brett Kavanaugh was shortly in favour of proclaiming before the Senate’s Judgment Committee and the Future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we made all these crazy broadcasts then and the people said ‘This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
"I thought that was a kind of joke, but it turned out that they were right."

Spender money flows the closest races for seats in the Congress at the intermediate elections
It is little surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania is overflowed by donations, thanks to the new limits of the election districts, which led to two officials in the race around the same seat.
The recent new pre-City district in Pittsburg allows the Democratic Conor Lamb, who won its seat in another district in the course of a special election in the previous spring.
Lamb opposes another official owner, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is strongly crossed with the new 17th district.
The cards were resigned after the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were cast against the Constitution and manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a breakdown of election funding between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was announced in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a highly respected special election in March by the 18th election district of the State.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump won a 20-percent spring.
Polit experts admit a light leadership to the Democrats.
The United States examined El Salvador's punishment for its support for China, but then turned back
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognised without having struck great resistance from Washington.
Trump graduated in June 2017 with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Valero, and had a hotel in Panama to partner, throwing out the management team of the Trump Organization.
Officers of the US Foreign Ministry have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions not to accept Taiwan anymore”, said Heather Nauert, spokesman of the Ministry in an opinion at the beginning of the month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador was thought of criminal measures, which estimated $14 million in 2017 on US aid, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar assembly in the previous year and represented a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
In mid-September, however, high government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively completed the consideration of criminal measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now set up as a speaker at the conference appointed on mid-October to set a sign of the importance that the government of the congregation has to gain, according to diplomats.
The three American diplomatic representatives have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic silently, without new creative communications or penalties from Washington.
A government speaker by John Bolton rejected an opinion on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who, under the condition of anonymity, agreed to express themselves to the internal meetings.
Their opinions were confirmed by one of the government's external analysts, who also spoke under the condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next great surprise could be the report by the special mediator Robert Mueller on the potential disability of justice, for which there are now sufficient evidence in the public.
Mueller now claims to also examine whether Trump's election team with Russia has conspired in its attack on American elections.
If the majority of the conventions change, Trump faces a body that forces him to account, precisely at the time when he passes forward to standing before the voters, and perhaps before a jury of vows.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I do not want to say that the case of Donald Trumps, or that of its European pendants, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were willing to carry out a state war against Hitler if the West had only opposed him and had supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of the Barbarei that followed.
The course of history is about such turning points and the inconsistent march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are just facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump leaves the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, i.e. the man who decides about the future of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Devil's kitchen since this newspaper last year reported that he suggested to record the president secretly and wondered whether he was inappropriate to the office.
Rosenstein dementes the presentation of the New York Times.
“How will we answer if the newly ordained FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed in the Office despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false statements?
And above all, will we vote in the intermediate elections for a convention that forces the tromp to account?
If we fail in these trials, a long winter is ahead of us.
But I think we will not fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once had occupied my news home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me out 60 years later to inflamme Sabbath candles on the table with the crown cross.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians will be placed in a good position for the Qualification of the G Group of the Europe League after the impressive remise against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month.
Due to a knee injuries, Graham Dorrans could not appear until 2-2 equality against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a jumpboard for larger sizes.
“This was an important point for us, since Villareal is very good”, said the 31-year-old.
We have gone into the game with the conviction that we can do something from it and we have gone home with a point.
Perhaps we could still have won at the end, but a total disagreement was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked in the second half and then were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but this will be a heavy party, since they have achieved a good result in the last game. But I am sure we can go through this with the audience and achieve a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult with all that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the boys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward now, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of age care leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the participants knew exactly how to care for them, few of them talked about it with their family members.
Approximately half of the participants in the study of Nationwide indicated to talk to your mates about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent indicated to talk to their children about it.
“The people want a family member to care for them, but do not take the steps necessary to conduct the conversation”, says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of National Life Insurance Spares.
This is what you should start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your wishes in time.
Work with your consultant and family to discuss where and how you want to be maintained, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Bring your financial consultant on board: your consultant can also help you find a way to finance these expenditure.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-based life insurance to help cover these costs or self-security with your own assets - as long as they have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Turn off disputes in the last minute.
Instruct a precautionary force so that you are in charge of a familiar person to monitor your medical care and ensure that health professionals meet your wishes, you should be unable to express it yourself.
Consider also a power for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid, you should not be able to do so.
Don't forget the details: imagine your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicine or allergies?
Sign up these details in a written plan so that you are ready.

The victim, a man in the 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot into the chest, the abdomen and the hand.
Officers describe the shots that took place at about 02:30 in the UK as "willing action".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami, who met on Friday at the Indonesian city of Palu, the authorities. The number of dead is expected to rise.
Due to the defective communication systems, helpers were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, a area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of earthquake with the strength of 7.5.
In Palu more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central-Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a district of the northwest of the island of Sulawesi over a coastal area of over 300 km (180 miles) length.
In the government district, a administrative unit below the province, it was estimated that 299,900 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of intake in the central-Sulawesis economy, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
Nickelab construction is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesis.
Palu and Donggala have been repeatedly victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster protection authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West-Donggala was met in 1996 by a tsunami in which nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the Seismic Pacific Fire Ring, and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern Sumatras triggered a tsunami, which met 14 countries and cost 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A number of heavy earthquakes shaken the West Coast of Sumatras between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nia's islands off the coast of Sumatras.
2006: A earthquake with the strength of 6.8 shattered the southern Javas, Indonesia's most populous island and triggered a tsunami that met to the south coast and demanded almost 700 deaths.
2009: A earthquake with the strength of 7.6 met at the city Padang, the capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake with the strength of 7.5 shakeed one of the Mentawai islands before Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres high, which destroyed dozen villages and demanded about 300 lives.
2016: A light earthquake shattered the District of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunamis of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died by a drought building.
2018: Heavy earthquakes met the Indonesian island Lombok, popular for tourists, and primarily demanded more than 500 deaths on the north side of the island.
The cube destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily struck on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for presumption of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor Alaskas and former candidates for the office of the Vice-President, was arrested due to presumption of infringement.
The 29-year-old Palace from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested due to the suspect of domestic violence, the disability of reporting domestic violence and resistance to state violence, so a report published by the police Alaskas on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a acquaintance when he wanted to interact with the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is located in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a deposit of $500 has been charged.
On Saturday he appeared before court, where he, when he was asked for his pleading, answered with “Non-guilty, Very Safe”, said the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three infringements of class A, which can be punished up to one year and a penalty of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with an orderly infringement of class B, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 penalty.
It's not the first time that Palin's criminal advertisements were raised.
In December 2017 he was invited to attack his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being negotiated before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was precluded from domestic violence, disability of reporting a crime and arms possession under drug influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend pretended him to beat her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by Veteran Organizations in 2016 after she brought her son's behaviour to a posttraumatic burden disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquakes in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake that the Indonesian island of Sulawesi shocked on Friday.
The pest with a strength of 7.5 triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Power and communication networks are interrupted and it is expected that the number of dead will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just in front of the coast of Central-Sulawesis, located northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the Tsunami met on the coast.
Federal Attorney calls for rare death penalties for suspects in New York Terror attack
The Federal Attorney in New York calls for the death penalty of Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the attack of New York City, who cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has no longer been committed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a hired pick-up of the construction market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack, in the course of which he rushed on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight of the victims "speakedly" and "consciously added serious infringements of the body," says the intention declaration for the claim for the death penalty submitted in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished by death according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigation court submitted a complaint in 22 points involving eight accusations of the murder in the light of the organised crime which is usually used by state lawyers in the case of organised crime, as well as an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demands 'founding planning and purpose', according to the prosecutors, who described the kind in which Saipov carried out the action, as 'disgusting, cruel and corrupt'.
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov added to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage, pain and losses”, explained the Declaration.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
For over a decade, the southern district of New York has no longer pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The accused Khalid Barnes was spoken guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to a lifelong sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in New York during a federal crime, was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been spoken guilty of two years before the conspiracy of spying for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, proved in the days and months after the attack of lack of repentance, so court documents.
He told the mediators to feel good with what he did, so the police.
Saipov explained to the authorities that he was actually inspired after he had looked at videos from ISIS on his phone, said the accusation.
According to police statements, he also called on the flag of ISIS to hang in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public federal defenders representing Saipov, stated that she was “of course disappointed” because of the decision of the state prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty rather than a guilt in exchange for a lifelong penalty without accepting the possibility of release will only extend the dream that all the parties suffer,” says Patton.
Saipov's defense team had before asked the charge not to claim the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party calls on NIGEL FARAGE to transfer the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage swore to mobilise “the power of the people” today during a protest action under the Tories Conference.
The former Chairman of the Ukip Party stated that politicians must “people the pressure” of the European shipowners, while a member of Theresa May's Party proposed that Farage should lead negotiations with the EU.
The conservative rear bänker Peter Bone explained to the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom was “already out” if Farage Brexit ministers were.
The challenge that May faces in reconciliation of its deeply distorted parties has been intensified by taking part in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems to keep Chequers' compromise plan in spite of attacks from the Brexit Consultant, Brexit and the EU.
Alliances argued that, despite the counter-reactions, she should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels and thus force Euro-scepticians and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the "Chaos".
Bone explained at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers on the waste’ belongs.
He proposed that Farage should have been appointed a peer and should have delegated to him the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was responsible, we were already outside,' he explained.
The Member of Wellingborough added: ‘I’m going to enter the Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the waste.’
He emphasized his opposition to the EU: ‘We have not struggled in world wars to be subject to subjection.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.’
Bone rejected claims that since the referendum in 2016, public opinion has changed: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and now want to stay in the EU is totally wrong.’
The Brexit President of the Conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also on the demonstration and explained to reporters: ‘I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘The compromise is unwelcome in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unwelcome in our own party and in our activists, who actually go through the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Please give up Chequers and start listening.’
In a splendid message to May, she continued: ‘Premier ministers keep their jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage explained in a speech that politicians need to ‘people the pressure’, they should just be involved in defeating the decision of the 2016 referendum.
‘This is now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class’, so Farage.
'They try to deceive the Brexit and therefore we are here today to say to them, 'Don't you come from it'.
Before an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: ‘I want you to let our political class, which is shortly before to betray the Brexit, feel the pressure.
‘We mobilize the power of the people of this country, which will help us to victory in the referendum and will never come to rest as long as we are not independent, self-hearted, proud United Kingdom.’
At the same time, Brexit-generator marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour customer in the city centre.
A few activists swifted the banner of the Tories Against Brexit grouping, a group of Brexit owners within May's party, which was called to life on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, Peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security problems with a party app when opening the conference.
‘This is the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,’ Adonis said.
‘This is a Farce.
There's just not the good Brexit,' he added.
Warren plans to examine the Presidential Candidate ‘complete’
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren explained that after the elections in November, she would "check the presidential candidate."
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an explicit critic of President Donald Trump, is just in the race for re-electing the Senate against the Republican Members in Parliament of Massachusetts Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of Trump's electoral team in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was the center of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been 36th meeting with voters in the so-called town hall format since Trump's office.
One of the attendants asked her if you would like to admit to the Presidency.
Warren replied that it would be for women at the time “to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top."
Arrest after death grants on LSU player Sims
The police of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that in the case of the deadly shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested from Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had arrested at 11 a.m. East Time.
They had published a video of shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot near the campus of the Southern University on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims suffered a shot injuries on his head and died as a result of this injury,” says the sports media portal 247 sports by police chief Murphy J. Paul on Saturday.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to be at the scene and possession of a gun and to have shot on Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and kept in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-metre-size Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and was able to show an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Great price of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship title after his team left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in Qualifying before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' chair order would play a great role in the race.
From the Pole position, Bottas got a good start and it was almost like he introduced Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton turn into the carriage at the end of the driver field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went to the box a round later and landed behind the Vettel, but Hamilton retreated him after a tight wheel-to-rad manoeuvre, where the Ferrari pilot resisted the inner side to persist with the risk of two movements to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started on one of the behind places of the field and was on his 21th birthday after the end of the first round on place seven.
He was then for a large part of the race of the fastest, as he kept on his tire to stop quickly and pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He finally went to the 44th round in the box and did not make it possible to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen ended as a fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri brought an excellent performance throughout the weekend and like a real gentleman acted when he had to leave me by.
The team has done excellent work to achieve a double victory," said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump was funny on Saturday at a election event on Senator Dianne Feinstein, who persisted to have not transmitted the letter by Christine Blasey Ford, in which it would not have passed on to the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexual abuse.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford's statement was not directly addressed to the Senate’s Judgment Committee, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are “sensitive, evil and dishonest”.
“One thing that could happen and the miraculous thing that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and malicious and evil and dishonest”, said the President.
“ When you look at the Leaks and then say, “Oh, I wasn’t.
I wasn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, wait a minute.
If we have it... No, we haven't published it," he added by imitating the voice of the senator.
Feinstein was awarded the letter with Ford's accusations against Kavanaugh in July and he was published early in September. However, Feinstein deprives that the leak is from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't publish your story," said Feinstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter secret and I answered her request for secret."
Your Dementi did not seem to come well to the President, who said on Saturday evening at the election campaign event: “I tell you one that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In its continual defense of the Judge candidate, which three women are prosecuting sexual abuses, the Democrats claimed to use the accusations for their own purposes.
“You are determined to regain power with all means.
It is seen the community, the wickedness, they do not care about who they hurt when they get under the wheels to receive power and control," said the president, according to the mediate.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer reached two gates for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the defeat on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants through a 5:3 victory in the backplay in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants went early with two gates in the direction, after matches by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the compensation for the home team before Dwyer restored the leadership of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard looked like Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two gates.
This was unexpected for the men of Adam Keefe, who Dundee struck on Friday evening 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giant won the three previous parties.

In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back to the game after 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt Cownie helped to his compensator after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the leadership of the Giants before the half-time break, when he reached his second gate in the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team newly grouped and Bouchard rejoined with a power-player in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen take Dundee for the first time in the party late in the second half. Nielsen then secured his team the victory with a fifth gate after just half of the second half.

Flightlots died after he was sure that hundreds of people in a plane escape the earthquake
A flight fleet in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death to safely start a plane with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake that caused a tsunami on Friday.
Strong descendants are still to be felt in the region and many people are trapped in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his posts in the strongly varying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained to make sure that Batik Air's flight of 6321, which was on the start track at the time, could safely remove it.
He then jumped out of the Tower when he thought he was coming.
Agung died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman of the Indonesian Air Safety Service, explained that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, says Australia's ABC News.
“We have provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately he died tomorrow before the helicopter could meet in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this message," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of dead could rise to several thousands. The country's Catastrophe Protection Authority stated that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number of bodies is expected to rise, as many bodies are still under the drums, while others cannot be reached”, says the speaker of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho Authority.
Waves up to 6 metres of height have destroyed Palu, which will keep a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supply goods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: “Every minute a new car comes with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, explained: “The Indonesian Red Cross is quick to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech before the military of the country: “I ask you to work every day and night to carry out all the tasks associated with evacuation.
Since you've been ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini is now reporting on a missing person after a plane crash in Lagune
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific Lagune in Micronesia, now reports about a missing person after first claiming that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the falling plane.
Air Niugini explained in an announcement that until Saturday afternoon they cannot say anything about the remaining of a passenger.
The Airline announced working with local authorities, hospitals and mediators to find the man.
The Airline did not answer immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water during the attempt to land on the Chuuk Island airport.
Officers claimed that seven people had to be brought to a hospital.
The airline claimed that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday but were in a stable state.
The cause and the exact outcome of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both explained that the plane landed in Lagune just before the landing train.
Some Witnesses thought that the plane fled over the landing train.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane was very flat.
"This is a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wax through ventilated deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the falling plane.
He said that the flight companions paniced and screamed and he suffered a smaller head injury.
The U.S. Navy suggested that matroses working near the improvement of an installation site with a blastable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane fell in about 30 meters (100 feet) deep water.
The data from the Aviation Safety Network can be found that 111 persons killed in crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them covered Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the expiry of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the accusation concluded its proof in the re-treatment of a case where a man is proposed to have banned a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The Analyticist of the American Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett declared for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night.
Rowlett said to have received position data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of her death. This contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he indicated to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness state on Saturday and said that he hadn't been in the city on the day.
When the accusers asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said that he had lied, "when my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis indicated that he had known Chambers at their death date two weeks.
But phone records pointed out that they knew a week.
Rowlett explained that Tellis ran out of his cell phone for a while after Chamber's death of their news, calls and contact information.
"He has removed them from his life," said Hale.
The defense is expected to start its pledoyers on Sunday.
The Judge assumes that the procedure will then go before the jury this day.

Another black man?
New York Children's Girl accused pairs for a release after “racial” SMS
A New York children's girl complained to a couple because of a discriminatory dismissal, after receiving a misleading message from the mother, in which it complained that she was "now a black one".
The couple contested to be racist and compare the dispute with a 'depression'.
The two-fold mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her distress when she found that the new day's mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she approached her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEIN, NO NO SWARZE," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice. Two times.
After she recognized her Fauxpas, the “peinly touched” Plasco-Flaxman Maurice escaped and claimed that the unlocked Afro-American day mother had done bad work and expected a Philippine instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with a Uber.
Maurice now charges the couple for compensation for the release and claims for compensation for the $350 per day, which she should have been booked for over six months, for which she had originally been booked, but without contract, and for which she had lived with the couple.
"I want to show them, see, what is not done," she explained in the newspaper on Friday, "I know that this is discrimination."
The couple rejected the Rassism suggestions, and argued that the release was the reasonable step, as they feared Maurice, after they had offended them, not to be able to trust anymore.
“My wife sent her something that she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racialists," explained Joel Plasco's husband.
“But would you trust your children in a person who was unhearted to them, even if it was mistaken?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compares the dispute with a 'depression' and explained that his wife was expecting a baby in only two months and is "in a difficult situation".
“You want to interest such a person?
This is not very nice," added the investment banker.
While the dispute continues, the couple were quickly condemned in the public and accused of social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify themselves with a speaking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of the author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said about the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it is very funny with our modern knowledge of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had had no problem with it, his work would have been rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death in the last year was “bitterly”.
She explained that your father was secretly proud of the success of Paddington, which she describes as "very important family member".
"He was a very silent man and did not splendid," said Jankel.
“But because Paddington was so real for him, it was almost as if you have a child who does something special: you are proud, even if it wasn't really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like that.
Although he found and created him, he always gave Paddington himself responsible for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was brought to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that it really looks bad and that the doctors gave her little chances,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, in which he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I would have to say goodbye.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that you gave the doctors to keep her heart pumped slowly sounded down and left her body.
She died just before, and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn't do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to break myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning about the loss of her daughter, went on board the plane with the other passengers who didn't get anything from what she was through.
"None knew it," she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran me all the time over my wings.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Swearing women hang up cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost their family by a suicide strive to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys were on a bridge in Wales cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers for consulting centres.
Davis son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he began suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel like I feel every day,” she explained.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was presenting a promising career as a cook and he had an insecting smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could light a room."
However, he announced his job before his death, as he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014 Tyler's body was found after the suicide by his 11-year-old brother.
Davis explained: “I always fear that this could have a consequence.”
Davis has designed the cards to “to show people that there are people you can go to and to whom you can talk to even if it is a friend.
Don't be silent: you have to talk about it."
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was 15 years old, just after his mother died.
“He did not say that he felt depressed or depressed,” she explained.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas he was on the depth. When the children packed out their gifts, he did not see them in their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great dream for her, but that it had to go through: “There is a huge hole in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the sweep while the FBI starts with investigations
'I thought that if we were actually able to get something like that he asked, i.e. a timely and limited investigation, we might be able to get a little intake,' said Flake on Saturday.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Your resentment can be brought back to the timing alone.
The intermediate elections on November 6 are only five weeks away. If the Republicans cut down as expected, they would be significantly weak in their attempts to choose their husband into the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush took the phone hearer to call Senators and convince them of supporting Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush and gathered his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents his report?
There is a vote in the Senate, in which 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the Vice-President, to decide in voting equality and to confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean overruns ‘inct’ under Kim
The number of North Korean overruns to South Korea has fallen in power since Kim Jong-un seven years ago, so a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, called on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunion, explained that last year 1127 overruns were registered compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called more stringent border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human smugglers than major factors.
Pjöngng didn't express himself publicly.
The vast majority of the Nordic overruns are finally offered the South Korean citizenship.
Seoul suggests that since the end of the Korea war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most flee across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China views the surpassers as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often brings them back with violence.
The relations between the north and the south, which are still technically in the state of war, have significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the two Heads of State in Pjöngyng met to talk about the denuclearization negotiations.
This was the result of the historical meeting between the US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work on a Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Unless we can trust in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm us first," said Mir Ri in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says that he is not suitable for the Office at the Supreme Court of Justice.
The minority leader at the Nancy Pelosi Representative House called judges Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said that he was inappropriate to the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not reject the impression that a woman who had acted so would have been called ‘hysteric’,” said Pelosi about her reaction to the statement of Kavanaugh before the Senate’s Judgment Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh in a emotional way denied all the accusations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both teenagers were.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional. Sometimes he cried fast and stood shortly in tears when he spoke about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee and called the accusations against him a "great and coordinated call murder" organized by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton's lost presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proves that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as they show that he was pre-accepted to Democrats.
"I believe that he himself declared inadequate with these statements and the way he went to Clintons and Democrats," she explained.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to withdraw Kavanaugh from the Office, he should be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the representative house.
"I will say so much: if he does not say the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to the Supreme Court, but also to his present judges," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently Judge at the Bundesberufungsgericht in Washington D.C.
Pelosi continued that as a Democrat she was concerned about possible decisions Kavanaughs against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion basic decision Roe v. Wade, since he is estimated as a conservative judge.
In his hearings Kavanaugh asked whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"We don't need a hysterical, preoccupied person who goes to this court and expects us to say, 'Ach is not wonderful'," said Pelosi.
Women have to use it as a gun.
It is a sincere hatred speech, months and years of overcrowding anger and she does not get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think this is rare, and you?"
She continued: “I was helped by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she was crying when she got angry but developed a technique. When she gets angry and begins to cry, she tells the person to whom she said: “You might think that she is sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just keep talking.
I liked this.
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories is of an earlier job, in one office dominated by men, where I was crying on one day because of an unwritten anger and by an older woman, an undercooled manager, for whom I was always a little scared, packed at the crown and moved into a staircase.
"Let her never see you cry," she told me.
“You don't know you're stinksucker.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied because they believe in the substance they have gone to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congress member of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on its presidential candidates.
In 1987, when hard on board a ship called Monkey Business was caught in an out-of-hearted business and then his candidateship returned, the deepest frustrated scroeder considered that there was no reason to consider the idea of the presidential candidate.
“This was not a good reasoned decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation ‘Sneewitch and the seven dwarfs’.
Since the election struggle was already advanced, it was back in the funding purchase and she swore not to candidirate if it had not to get two million dollars together.
It was an unparalleled fight.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 were only supporting their campaign with $250.
"Do they believe I get a discount?" she asked herself.
At the speech in which she announced not to start a official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, thankfulness for her supporters, frustration about the system that made the funding purchase and direct addressing of the voters rather than the delegates, as well as the anger over sexism, so that she was close to the tears.
“You could have assumed that I had a nervous collapse,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.

Why Beijing could benefit from trade war between the United States and China
The opening salvages of the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming. Although the battle has not been over for a long time, Beijing could benefit from a grave between the countries in the long term, my experts.
Donald Trump, the American President, fired the first warning shot at the beginning of the year when he occupied important Chinese export goods, including solar cells, steel and aluminium, with penalties.
The most important escalation took place this week with new penalties on goods worth $200 billion, which effectively affects half of all goods imported from China to the United States.
Beijing ran back in the same way each time and recently raised penalty from five to ten percent on American goods worth $60 billion.
China swore to answer any US action and it is unlikely that the second largest economic power in the world will soon be stolen.
To move Washington to the instinct, would mean to give up. However, a public enclosure to the United States would be too delicate for China's President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that when Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit long-termly from the effects of the trade war by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is in fact far more dangerous than many observers have previously recognised,” says Abigail Grace, a scientific employee who focuses on Asia at the New American Security Denkfabrik Center.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, so the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help for the reconstruction of the country destroyed by over seven years of war.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the situation in the country improves.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he explained.
The government rebuilds the territories destroyed by terrorists to reverse normality.
All the conditions are now provided for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their everyday life and life bases.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government welcomes help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he emphasized that there would not be any conditions related to assistance from countries that had supported the rebellion.
Europe won a victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the Ryder Cup 2018 and conquered the United States team with a final level of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown after the team of the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points that needed to conquer the United States.
The American Star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over a large part of the tournament, reduced his deduction on the 16th train (Par 3) in the water and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of four players who achieved a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was hit 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in the team of Europe, Thorbjorn Oles from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the English Ian Poulter who may have played his last rider cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, veteran from eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player in all times with 25.5 career points.
“ Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t stand back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so infinitely happy to get the pokal back.
It's about the team and I'm glad to have contributed," said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues to reach the fackle to his landsman John Rahm, who won against the American golf-learning Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual meetings.
I am so incredible proud of having hit Tiger Woods that I have been following in television since my childhood," said the 23-year-old frame.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup bilance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistics for one of the biggest players of all times who won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had the entire weekend problems to find the Fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have done high-level performance during the whole tournament.
According to a disappointing performance of his team, American captain Jim Furik said: “I am proud of the boys, they have fought.
There was a time today when we put Europe under pressure.
We didn't do anything from it.
Hut for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players made a good performance.
We will regroup, I will talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be her captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were conquered."
