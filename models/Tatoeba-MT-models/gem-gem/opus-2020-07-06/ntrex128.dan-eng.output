Politicians in Wales fear of "equal fools"
Some Members of the Walisian National Assembly were terrified of a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the House to the Welsh Parliament (Walisian Parliament).
AMs from all the political spectrum are concerned that the change of name could cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party said that his group was worried because "it rims on Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Wales, twp means the fool, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that the group as a whole "was not satisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said that his group was "open" toward the change of name, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from MWP to Muppet (fives).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is expressed in the same way as the letter u is spoken in Yorkshire English.
Assembly Commission, which currently composes a legislative proposal on the introduction of the changes in the names, said: "The final decision on designations which Members of Parliament will receive is of course up to the members themselves."
Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals with broad support for calling the Assembly for a Welsh Parliament (Welsh Parliament).
With regard to the title of the AM, the Commission prefered Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP was given the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs suggest alternative options, but the fight to reach agreement can prove difficult to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to compose a legislative proposal on the changes within a few weeks.
The legislative proposal for reforms contains other changes in the way the Assembly works on, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the composition of the Committee System.
The AM will receive the final vote on what to be called when the legislative proposal is debated.
Macedonians shall vote on the amendment of the country's name
The voters vote on Sunday whether their country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote will be held in an attempt to solve a decades of struggle with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of their Northern Neighbours is a demand for Greece's territory and has long protested against Macedonia's attempt to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says that he will undertake the vote.
Members of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is just a price paid to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's stay quiet while the churches in Harlem fight
"The older people I've been talking to said that there was a bar and a church on every corner in ancient times," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there's none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"Folk socializes in other ways today," he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go in on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he is concerned that the money gained from selling assets will not last long and that they are "once or later back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who do not help the neighborhood's returning temptations.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy ownerships in these buildings are white," he says, "and it pusses further to the development where these churches finally close completely, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the property will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropol – Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had worked nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the priest John Howard Johnson, who stood at the top of a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the primary shopping streets in Harlem, who would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building severely, but when Father Johnson’s family children planned to restore the building, they ordered the bell game.
The priest David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played on the bell game in June called it something else: "A cultural tax" and "a incompatible historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell game in the world that was played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the bigger bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's didn't find a replacement for him.
What has been played in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs. Some of them have been collected by the leaders of the church, others of the bishop.
In July, the Assembly Council, the leader of the congregation, consisting of leading physicians, wrote to the bishop of concern that the bishop "would try to push the costs on" to the Congregation Council, even though the Congregation Council had not been involved in hiring the architects and entrepreneurs sent into the bishop.
Some of the members of the congregation complained about the lack of transparency of the bishop.
Hay damages 13-year-old on diving trips after lobsters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he popped for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officials.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had popped with friends for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he thought it was just excitement to catch a lobster, but then he realized that the boy cried, "I was bite!
I got bite!"
He said, "Hell his crib was ripped up," he saw when he came to the boy.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water, "There is a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was flying to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported in critical condition.
It's not known what kind of shark that attacked.
Larry Giles said by a media newsletter that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had traumatic damage to his upper torso.
Officers closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours of security and to conduct studies.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan to take the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's competitors with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in style with stormagasines.
As part of a great effort to take the UK beauty market, which has a value of 2.8 billion GBP and continues to grow, while fashion and housing products fall. The larger ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 shops around the country and are launched in several shops next year if they prove to be a success.
The investment in beauty products takes place as supermarkets are looking for new products for shelves previously used for television, microwave and housing products.
Sainsbury's says they double their selection of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, introduced for the first time.
The existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also get more space with branded areas in style with those you see in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also relancers the range of Boutique-makeup, so most of the products are suitable for veganers – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the parfum shop Fragrance Shop has two Sainsbury's shops. The first opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the other opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later a year.
Online shopping and a development towards buying small quantities of food daily in local buyers means that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury's, has said that the shops will be like storm gasines, as the supermarket chain starts the fight with the Aldi and Lidl discount chains by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales sites in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of Habitat sales sites since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their sales of daily goods and have made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint action with Boots in the early 00's, but cooperation ended with a dispute on how the sales of pharmaceuticals in the supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 shops to Celesio, owning the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 GBP three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury care fires such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have changed the appearance and layout of our ranges with beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in particularly trained colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our selection of fires is designed to take care of all the needs and the growing environment and the practical locations means that we are now a convincing destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "razing", after Holly Willoughby withdraws from agreement to 11 million GBP
Dragons' Den-Stern Peter Jones left "razing" after the TV host Holly Willoughby draws from agreement to 11 million GBP with his lifestyle fire to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their housing product and accessories-brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire.
This morning host, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den-Stern Peter Jones angry after she withdraws from their luxurious lifestyle fire at the last moment – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "razing" when the popular television woman during a tension meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow in Buckinghamshire meant that her new agreements – with a value of up to 1.5 million GBP – had no longer enough time for their housing product and accessory brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrows Goop fire and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million GBP.
Willoughby, 37, went to Instagram to announce that she left Truly while Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday balls.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she had to deal with the next few decades.
Her decision to move surprised all involved.
No one would believe what happened Tuesday, it was so close to the launch.
There is a stock full of products in the headquarters of Marlow, which are already ready for sale."
Experts estimate that the report from This Morning host, which is among the United Kingdom stars with the highest earnings, can cost the company several millions due to large investments in products – from powders to stearin lights to clothing and housing products – and the potential for further delays in launching.
And it can also end a long friendship.
Mother of three Willoughby and the householder Dan Baldwin have had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, attended as Governing Chairman in March.
The two pairs are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby must be a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host at ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We couldn't comment on his business operations."
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love."
He laughed with the criticism he would receive from the news media to give a comment that "not a President worthy" and to be so positive to the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump abandoned so much?
said Trump in his parodi on a newsman.
"I didn't give up."
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump exclaimed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have gone up.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders in the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "equivalent response" from the United States compared to North Korea's initial action against disarmament.
He noted that, instead, the United States continues with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump adopted a more optimistic view in the speeches at its electoral meeting.
"It's really good with North Korea," he said.
"There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve the relationship with Kim had created positive results – the end of rocket tests, help with the release of hostages and the return of earthly residues from American military men.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
"It is so easy to act stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to enter this tight-packed arena, we would have about 200 people standing there," said Trump and pointed to the group right in front of him.
Indonesian tsunami and earthquakes destroy the island and kill several hundreds
In the post-Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population were homeless, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so it is a little challenging," said Sumbung.
While Save the Children compose a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet safe whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for national emergency preparations, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the emergency action.
Because of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly exposed to, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami refugees have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common view of other coastal lines.
A warning was issued in Palu, but apparently a tsunamisirene is missing, and it has probably affected the death rate.
Even under the best conditions it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia's lack of infrastructure a central point in his election struggle, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and two-growns.
However, Mr Joco's administration has been plagued by lack of funding in the course of the next year's election campaign.
Mr Joko also experiences pressure from underlying sectural tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were removed from their homes, when Christian and Muslim bands struggled on the streets with mackers, bows, and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge equals in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute of Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, while his team was back with 1-0.
He knocked to the ball with the left foot before he made a high shot against the remotest chairpe.
The ball flew high over the field to the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just about getting in the position to get the ball. Players like Shaq always try to get as far as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came and I made a single touch. I didn't think so much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the semi-level, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea attacker returned with the heel to Mateo Kovacic before he set the speed up on the midway and sprinted into Liverpool's track half.
Kovacic made a fast one-two on the midway.
He then made a long delivery that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defense and ended against the remotest chairpe with a shot with left foot past Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights against Napoli in the group game in the Champions League at 15 Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo, Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton in UEFA Europe Leaguge at 15 Thursday in London.
Death rate from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death figure from Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunami has risen to 832 reports the country’s catastrophic preparation early Sunday.
There were reports of many trapped in the walls from buildings falling down after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the judge scale. It hit Friday and created up to 6 meters of waves, the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by murmurs from collapsed buildings.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell will be the latest memorial that is covered by discussions on the 'rewriting of history'
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, which were performed by his fanatic puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "galship" and a "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the context of the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace at Westminster would become a goal.
The image storm during the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas' actions in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's amazing image of Cromwell is a proof of attitudes in the 19th century and part of historiography for a figure that many still believe it is worth commending.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate image is undergoing ongoing historical debate.
What is certainly that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognized figure representing one side of the fight.
His performances as Lord Protector are also worth commending and remembering."
Dræbergris attacks and kills Chinese farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China according to local media reports.
The man, which is only identified under his surname "Yuan", was found dead with an overwhelmed pulse and injured in blood near a pigsite on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject pigs with vaccines by pig use on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the Qinghai Province in China.
He said he had traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province Yunnan Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pig road next to was open.
He said there was a big snake with blood in his mouth in the pigs.
A legal medical investigation confirmed that the pig of 250 kg had bited the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and hurt," said the cousin who goes under the surname "Wu", in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Recordings from security cameras showed that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 Thursday to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man wasn't Yuan or his cousin.
A leader of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while the police collecting evidence at the crime site.
It is reported that Yuan's family and authorities from the market negotiate compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rare, but there are previously registered cases where pigs have attacked people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 295 kg had a Welsh farmer against his tractor, to his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba CBC News told that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can work as a "trigger".
"They're just gay.
The naps, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect," he said.
The rest of the orkan Rosa is expected to give heavy rain in large parts of the southwest USA
As predicted, the orkan Rosa becomes weaker as it moves over the cooler water at the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will give strong rain of floods in northern Mexico and the Southwest USA over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 38 m/s, a category 1 orkan, at 10 Sunday (danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north of Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure runner over the Pacific, moving eastwards towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture north into the southwest USA.
Rosa will give up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico Monday.
Then the tropical moisture will interact with the low pressure trigger that comes closer and create strong rain in the southwest USA in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm floods, fluid decay and possibly earth scrap in the desert.
The tropical moisture will create rain of up to 51 to 76 mm rain per hour locally, especially in parts of the southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the Southwest United States, especially above large parts of Arizona.
There is a great probability of storms with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spread of the tropical rain.
It would be a very bad idea to move out in the desert to foot when there is danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can convert gaps to bulding rivers and thunder will create strong local winds and create dust-blowed.</seg>
The low pressure runner approaching will give strong rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total rainfall of more than 13 mm, which can cause smaller amounts of liquid decay and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in their raintime.
Spread tropical rainbows will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area Tuesday and continues on Wednesday.
In October there can be great temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic gets cooler, but there remains fairly warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences through the Central United States Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the Central and Eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start on October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast regions.</sew>
There can be up to 26 degrees in New York City Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long climate view indicates that temperatures are highly likely to be higher than the average in the Eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million saw the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million saw Thursday's vigilant testimony from the nominated to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual offense, which, accordingly, took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, at six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle with stations, which interrupted the general programs to tell about Friday's late development: A agreement composed by senator from Arizona Jeff Flake, which allowed the FBI to conduct a weekly study of the charges.
Ford told the Sennat's judgement committee that she was 100 per cent certain that Kavanaugh in drunk condition grammed on her and tried to take her clothes off to a gymnasie party.
Kavanaugh said in a sentimental testimony that he's 100 per cent certain that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20,4 million saw it Friday.
The company listed average views on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available views from other stations that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems with measuring how many people see programs in offices.
To set it in perspective, it is a spectrum that corresponds to a fight under the NFL playoffs or the Oscar distribution.
Fox News Channel, whose sensible hosts have strongly backed up the appointment of Kavanaugh, was above all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing that lasted all day, said Nielsen.
ABC was on the second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interests remained high after the consultation.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republicans office sent a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught for open CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, while demonstrators cried at him when he tried to take a lift to the hearing of the Judging Committee.
He stood with a look down for several minutes while he was shy, and CNN sent live.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he says the truth to the country?"
He was told, "You have so much power, and so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had sent a statement and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing of the committee.
All television stations covered live a few hours later, when the Judging Committee had to vote in favour of whether Kavanaugh's nomination should go on to a vote for the whole senate.
But Flake said he would only vote for under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominated one in the next week, which the Democrats, who are in number in the Senate, had asked.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators thereafter, Flake took his decision.
Flake's elections had an impact because it was clear that the Republicans would not have votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened a FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU for "play politics" with the future of the UK and undermine national interests.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to Theresa May on the front of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson made his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal on collecting the tariffs of each other was "too ridiculous".
Scotch killing Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson, suspected to stand behind the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect of the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned under suspicion of unattended man's murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
Officers released video from the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime site and said they found Simpson's DNA on, reported the WAFB CBS subsidiary.
After the hearing of Simpson, the police said he had confessed the shooting of Wayde.
His assurance is set to $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The lawmedician in East Baton Rouge Parish sent a preliminary report on Friday, where there was that the cause of death was a wound from a gun shot that went from the head to the neck.
The police department says that a task force from Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, police from Southern University and citizens of the area has assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The sports leader of the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the police in the area for their "suite and hunt for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per battle last season.
Friday morning, the basketball trainer at the LSU, Will Wade, said that the team is "knock" and "in shock" over Waydes' death.
"That's the kind you're always afraid of," said Wade.
Vulcan spying ashes over Mexico City
Aske, spyed from the Popocatepetl volcano, has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Prevention of Catastrophics warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater and 183 emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored the spaces and shaking over several rounds.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ashes on car routes in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital, since an earthquake, measured 7.1 on the guide scale, shattered central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
The police agree with Catalan separatists before anniversary for the vote on independence
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after demonstrators who wished independence, joined unrest officers in having several thousands participated in rivalizing demonstrations that chose the first anniversary of Catalonia's polar vote on release.
A group of masked separatists kept unrests, thrown with and powder painting and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also battles later on the day when the police used their rods to keep the fights down.
For several hours, independence groups called "Not forgotten, nothing forgiven", and were met with Unionist demonstrations who cried "Long Life Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage that occurred during the protests, reported the local press.
The vote remains high in the independent region one year after the vote on 1 October, which was declared illegally from Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters voted in excessive degree for independence, but the vote was low, and those who were opposed to the release bonocotted in great style the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were damaged last year, after the police tried to stop the vote during violent controversy at voting sites throughout the region.
Independence groups had camped the night to Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer dare hope that Catalonia can gain independence.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying joyfully about having the opportunity to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Although they had a narrow but important victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan Parties have struggled to maintain the momentum, and many of their best known leaders have either moved in exile or sitting in detention, waiting for their role in the conduct of the vote and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, took the protests on their phone as support for the police and said that the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
"There are getting bigger and bigger tensions," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been waiting for his trial since last year, announced that he would stand up for the elections to the European Parliament next year.
"The position as a candidate in European elections is the best way to disregard the relapse of the democratic values and the underwear we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested, by house hit by car
Three men of 33, 34 and 39 are arrested after a car several times hit into a house in Londonderry.
The event happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gates and the building itself.
It may also have been fired a bracelet against the car at a time.
Shoot from Menga gives Livingston victory on 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Mengas first goal for Livingston guaranteed victory
Livingston overlapped Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his only second defeat after 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas shots made the difference when Gary Holt's team pulled up side by side with Hibernian in the second place.
Gerrard's team hasn't won on the outline of the League in this season and will meet the leading team of Hearts, which they are ranking eight points after, next Sunday.
Before then, Rangers visits Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, expands their unconquered line to six matches, and leader Holt has still not received a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances of cash endurance
Holt's team should have been before a long time before, they scored, and their direct game style created great problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across the target, then Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the target, after he glided in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-section head in front of the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them because they knew that they could cause endurance problems in deathball situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
Rangers took a free park, and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the building for Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At that time, Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but struggled to get through the home team's defense, and the target Liam Kelly was largely not challenged.
That pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos had a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was disguised with the feet of Rangers' measurer Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame under another of Livingston's deathball situations.
Ongoing deliveries came into Livingston's field, but were abstained, and two demands for criminal park – after Halkett's attack on the replacer Glenn Middleton and one for hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phänomenal effort and strong results for Livingston.
All played fantastic and exceeded the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playstyle and trup are almost unchanged since their return to the best liga, but a large part of the honor must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he joined.
There were many heroes.
Commander Halkett was amazing and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toes throughout the game.
Rangers lacked dog inspiration.
They have sometimes been really good under Gerrard, but they played under level.
Their ends lacked sharpness – only once they got the home team – and it is a great wake for Rangers, located in the middle of the point table.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Køln
There was smile and blue sky Saturday (29 September), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at improving the relationship with the two NATO members.
There has been disagreements about areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and the approximations of Turkey to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, great mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police held out of security causes a population of 25,000 people from gathering before the Moscow, but a lot of supports appeared nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noticed and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept in the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest, seen as a hero of some German Turks and the ridiculous as a autocrat of others.
Deptford accidents: Cyklist dies in collapse with car
A cyclist is dead in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened close to the cross between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwest part of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped, and there were rescuers in the place, but the man died in the place.
The accident occurs a few months after another cyclist died in a collapse with a car whose driver escaped from the place, on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said that police were working on identifying the man and informing his contactors.
Road barriers have been set up, bus routes have been relocated, and motorists are invited to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six cops injured during an accident
Six prisoners have been injured during an alarm in a high security prison according to the Prison Office.
The HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire occurred at about 9.30 BST Sunday, and the disturbances are still in progress.
Specialized "Tornado" officers have been picked up to handle the outfits, which involve eight inmates and take place in one fleet of prison.
The officials were treated for smaller face damage on the site.
A spokesman for Prison Service said: "Specially trained prison staff are engaged in dealing with the current disturbances in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for damage.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we're explained about being sent to the police and can end up spending a longer time behind the trembs."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 employees, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated in the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year, warriors were invited to the prison to deal with serious distresses in which employees were attacked with billard bullets.
The Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with a flood of storms (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that a tropical low pressure strikes Arizona, but it is most likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the remains of the orkan Rosa move over the desert landscape in the southwest USA and pose a risk of storm flood.
National Weather Service has already sent warnings about storm floods for Monday and Tuesday in Western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a twot that only "tine tropical cycles had preserved status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra within 64 km from the border to Arizona."
The latest models from National Hurricane Center foresee 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated quantities up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin will probably get 25 to 51 mm with the possibility of 102 mm locally.
For those outside the risk of flooding, Rosa's rain can be a blessing because the region is affected by dryness.
Flooding is a very serious case, but it is likely that some of the rain will make use of because the Southwest United States currently experiences dryness.</seg>
According to the American Drying Monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme dry, the second highest category," reports weather.com.
First, the orkan Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja California half Island in Mexico.
Rosa still has an orkan force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 38 m/s and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moves north by 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific and therefore drops in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit in Mexico with tropical power forces on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over parts of Mexico can become strong and pose a high risk of flooding.
"A total of 76 to 152 mm from Baja California to Northwest Sonora is expected to be rainfall with up to 254 mm", reported Weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the border to Arizona early in the morning as tropical low pressure, which will then move up through Arizona and into the southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The primary expected danger from Rosa or the remains of it is very strong rain in Baja California, the northwest Sonora and the southwest desert area of the United States," reported National Hurricane Center.
Rain is expected to create life-threatening storms and flooding descents in deserts as well as earth screams in mountains.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempts to kill
Three teenager boys and a 20-year-old man are arrested under suspicion of attempts to kill after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset.
The teenager boy was found wound in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton around 4 BST Saturday.
He was brought to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested during the night in the Radstock area, the police are pronounced in Avon and Somerset.
Officers have called on all those who had to have mobile recordings of events to come.
Trump says that Kavanaugh was under the "goodness and anger" of the democratic party.
"A vote at Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unacceptable and unreasonable tactics of the democratic party," said Trump at a electoral meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been exposed to "devil, anger" from the democratic party through the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh gave a testimony before the Congress on Thursday and denied strong and emotional accusations from Christine Blasey Ford that he was sexually committed to her many decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also made a testimony at the hearing of his accusations.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote on confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that confirms one of the most skillful legal brains of our time, a lawyer with an amazing past in public service," he said to a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The President pointed indirectly to the nomination of Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of meetings of the Republicans at the votes at the midway elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
You can't vote on me, but you actually vote on me," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around and fighting for fantastic candidates."
Trump argued that the democrats were on a mission to "strip against and block."
The first important procedure vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a person placed in the Republican party told CNN.
Hundreds of killed by Indonesian earthquakes and tsunami, the death rate grows
At least 384 were killed, and many of them were shielded away from huge waves that hit the beach when a large earthquake and a large tsunami hit the Indonesian island Sulawesi, the authorities declared Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu Friday, when up to six metres of high waves hit the coast at the sucking time, many sucked in death and destroyed everything on their way.
After a earthquake that measured 7.5 on the judge scale, the Tsunami came.
"When the tsunamitrus came up yesterday, people were still in progress on the beach. They didn't run immediately and became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of Indonesia's emergency GDPB, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"Tsunami came not alone, the dragged cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on land," said Nugroho and added that the tsunami had moved through the open sea by 800 km/h before it hit the coast.
More people survived by climbing into trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16.700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The cathedral preparation has published air photographs showing many ruined buildings and shops, crushed and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Rewards continued to shake the coastal town Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be seen in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Board for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) reported that the energy triggered during Friday’s great earthquakes was about 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb that was thrown over Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bridge, which may have made the tsunami larger, said the board.
Nugroho described the damage as "inclusive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels were collapsed together.
The bodies of a number of victims were found fixed under the walls of collapsed buildings, he said, and added that 540 had been damaged, and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said that death and damage could be larger along the 300 km long coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, closer to the earthquake epicenter.
The communication "was completely lame without information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
"There are more than 300,000 lives here," said Red Cross in an announcement and added that their employees and volunteers are on the way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," they said.
On Saturday, the Board was criticized from many fronts not to indicate that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said that the waves had come within the time when the warning was sent.
In amateur records divided on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building who desperately calls warnings about the tsuami that come closer to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and wears buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the recordings.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a great flush that dissociated the communication around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue effort.
The military has begun to send freight flights with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, reports authorities, but there is still a hard need for food and basic necessities among the evacuated.
The city airport has been reopened, but only for help work, and remains closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centres in Palu Sunday.
The death number after Indonesian tsunami smokes over 800.
It's really bad.
World Visions staff from Donggala have come safely to Palu City, where employees are looking for lying under pressures set up in farms at their account. They came by areas with extensive destruction on the road, said Doseba.
"They told me that they were so many ruined houses," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when help organisations began to work hard to resume the aid work, complaints came that foreign emergency workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, financial assistance, supplies and employees from abroad must only enter if the area in which the accident has occurred is declared to be a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at province level," said Aulia Arriani, speaker of Indonesian red cross.
"When the government says, "Okay, it is a national disaster," we can open for international assistance, but there is no status yet."
On the second night in Palu after Friday's earthquakes and tsunami, friends and family to the missing people kept firm in the hope that their closest would be the miracles that light the dark stories of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was drawn up by a cliff.
On Saturday, rescue workers released a woman who had been captured under murmurers for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian paragliding country team, had trained two of the missing paragliders to Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
"As the veteran in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how he in the hours, after the news about the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted in only one crying flue instead of two blue.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
Thieves take 26.750 USD while filling money machine in Newport on the Levee
Twenty stole Friday morning $26.750 from a Brink's ancestry that was carrying out a money machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the police in Newport.
The car's driver had cleared the money machine in the entertainment complex and prepared to deliver more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran up behind the Brink's staff and stole a baggage that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw more suspects who escaped, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many people involved in the event.
Everyone with information on the identity of the thieves, please contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West switches name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, where he wrote: "The being previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had the name Ye for a while and used the name as the title of his eighth album, published in June.
The change takes place before his performance in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singers Ariana Grande at the show, who canceled for "emotional reasons," said the show's creator.
The name is a abbreviation of his present artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
"I think that 'ye' is the most commonly used words in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ye'," said West earlier in the year, when he discussed his album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused pages, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He's one of a number of famous rappers that's changed name.
Sean Combs has changed between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West's former partners, JAY-Z, has also switched between small and large letters and changed whether the binding line is included.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use military power against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised never to use military power against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th year for a bloody reimbursement action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.
Troops shot at a peaceful demonstration on the place on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 300 at a time when left-oriented student movements hit root many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly state grants to students and opening more free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of education is entering young people into criminal bands.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they use on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come, after various parts of the US government have announced artificial intelligence. However, the United States still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aimed at taking the first place in innovation within artificial intelligence by 2030.
"It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
Duplicate of the budget could double the chances that the next great performance of artificial intelligence will be achieved in the United States, Lee told the CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies in the artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that hit the highest ranged American Othello player, and later he became leader of Microsoft Research and director of the Google Department in China.
Lee acknowledged previous technology competitions supported by the US government, such as Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition would come so that the next visionary could be identified.
Researchers in the United States often need to work hard to get the legs from the government, says Lee.
"It isn't China who hits the academic leaders, that's the big business," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen efforts in artificial intelligence.
"I think PhDs in artificial intelligence should automatically have offered work permits.
China's State Council sent their Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a way that corresponds to the National Science Foundation and to other state organisations' allocation of money to American scientists, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Previously this year, the US Defence Ministry established a common center for artificial intelligence to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the foundation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in research in artificial intelligence.
However, American legislation, which seeks to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has remained silent for several months.
Macedonians shall vote on the amendment of the country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday on whether their country's name should be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia", an action that would solve a decades of struggle with Greece, which has blocked Macedonia's attempt to gain membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province named Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbouring country to the north is a requirement for the Greek territory and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has sought to enter NATO and the European Union.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's primarily slave population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the vote, and a boycot campaign has caused doubts about whether the vote will be the 50% required to be valid.
The question on the voting note was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Members of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is worth paying for access to associations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that originated as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote on the country's future, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU's paraply, because it means more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the votes and make it applicable.
The change of name would require a majority of two-thirds in Parliament.
The State election Commission said that at 13 a.m. there was no report on irregularities.
However, the election participation was at only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent at the latest parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of the registered electorate voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a chooser in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko participated in the vote in Macedonia on a change in the country's name, which would open up for membership of NATO and the EU, in Srumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and took a chair in front of tents set up by those who want to boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we will gain membership with travelling pans, not at the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn against others like China and Russia and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership would give a strong investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote for because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO," said Zaev after having voted.
He said a "yes" result would be a "security of our future."
A statement published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43% of the electorate would participate in the vote – less than the required participation.
Another measurement made by the Macedonian Television Channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of the respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Of these 70% said they would vote yes.
In order to be valid, the vote must be at least 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the procurement government since it entered into May last year.
See: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero fights throughout the Brighton Defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton Defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring that came after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a delivery on the midway at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran by three Brighton defense officers before he swallowed out on an open level.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green trees.
He struggled by one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a delivery to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used its first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used its right dust to overlist the Brighton measurer Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
"Aguero fights with some problems with his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola reports.
"We talked about playing about 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a target at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the immediate front in the Premier League game.
That target came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received in the sequence of the ball deep into the territory of Brighton.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of touches before he led Sterling to the remotest steam.
Sky Blues-forwards screwed the ball in the net just before it gleamed by targets.
City fights against Hoffenheim in the group game in Champions League at 12.55 Tuesday at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants Drille Rockies
Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn't have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the castum on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the possibility of participation in playoffs for Rockies, who has played a fight more than Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies at least held in a wild-card space with a 5-2 victory over National's Friday evening, but still have their first division title for good.
"Although we have nothing to play for, we can go to the fight well knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver, and that the opponents would play at the enough highest level I will face this year.
Why shouldn't I be excited to play under those conditions?"
Nationals have not yet announced the start-up to Sunday, but will probably put Scherzer into such a situation as a pitcher.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the plet for the 34th time, trained his throws Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his rest day.
The right hands player from Washington is located on 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings in this season.
Trump holds a voter meeting in West Virginia
The President pointed indirectly to the situation around his elections to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of meeting the Republicans at the votes at the midway elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It is one of the big, big – you can't vote on me, but you actually vote on me. That's why I travel around and fight for fantastic candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see, it happens right now.
And they are determined to get the power back with all available resources. You can see how wicked, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they're gonna hurt who they're gonna drive over to get power and control. That's what they want, power and control, but we don't want to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have, as a mission, "fighters and blockers".
"And you've seen it over the last four days," he said, "and the Democrats called it "guilty and evil and disgusting and lieful."
He referred to the supreme democratic senator of the Senate's Judgment Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which triggered a sound bowl from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you like the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, no, wait a minute – it was really bad body language – the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a spacious party.
They are intolerant to those who express their views
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted about censurering me, it wasn't really a surprise.
I am just the last in a wide range of Members of Labour who have been told that we are not welcome - only because we have made our opinion known.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was very distinguished from antisemitism.
In my case, the censur increase was on criticizing me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically enough similar problems that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
In the call for the meeting in Nottingham East Labour Friday, there was that "we want the meetings to be included and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Member, the meetings on Friday evening have just been like that.
Today, the tone in many meetings is unfortunately not so, and the promise of "friend, more gentle" policy is far back in the past if it ever started.
It has become more and more clear that deviating views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed to whether the party's leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared a political standpoint began to expect me to make an U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed to – whether it was about national security or the EU's internal market.
When I say my opinion in the public - and that's not really what I am saying - I am following a long series of cruel messages on the social media that call for the election and contradiction of the middle-suching policy and tell me that I should not be a member of the Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are addressed to me are usually political.
I have deep respect for professionalism and the desire to fight among the colleagues who are overcome every day with sexism or racism, but who are still fighting further.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour was to create a tolerant culture.
But in reality, it is no longer a spatial organization, and with every mistrust or change of selection rules the party becomes smaller.
I've had plenty of advice in the last two years, that if I lay down myself and isn't so loud, I'm going to be okay.
But that is not why I went into politics.
Since I became a member of Labour 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by the failure of the Thatcher Government to leave our classroom in a falling state, and I set myself to create better public services for those who need it – whether it has been as a city council member or minister of the government.
I have never hidden my policy, nor in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who made the motion for a resolution on Friday, I would say that when the country comes to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour leader.
But the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the local electorate, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no sort of threats about elections or political qualities will prevent me from acting out of what I think is your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ubeseyed Ayr becomes a top team
Two late scorings may have got the final result of drawing a not completely true picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this amazing entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Primeship.
They are now at the top of the scoreboard and are the only unconquered team of ten.
Finally, it was as much as their superior defense as their better exploitation of the chance that carried the home team, and trainer Peter Murchie had absolutely the right to be satisfied.
"Our fights have been demanding so far, and we are still unconquered, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Respect for Ayr, they used their chances better than us."
Grant Andersons score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful spark from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to the Scottish team player Rory Hughes, which was distributed to the battle of Warriors, gave Melrose a advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed up by a kick.
Climo expanded Ayr's leadership with a penal park just before halfgame. He scored and then got a soloscoring, so there was 17-5 to Ayr at the break.
But Melrose began well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's score, followed by a spark from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
There was then a long interruption because Ruaridh Knott had had had a serious damage. He was taken out of the level of bears. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the spring with a scoring from Stafford McDowall and a successive shot from Climo.
Funging Ayr commander Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose exploited their extra man with a scoring from Bruce Colvine without following kicking after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the emerging Ayr-klynge.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the stairs and followed up with a more almost just after, the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent pilot Gregor Henry going to the home track's fifth score.
Still Game Star looking for new career in the restoration industry
Still Game Star Ford Kieran seems to take the step to the restoration industry, after it came out that he has taken the director's post of an authorized restaurant business.
The 56-year-old player Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main person in together with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The Duo has announced that the next ninth season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan plans a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The scholar refused to comment on history, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the Indian State of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen route to the Pacific
Seamen patrol around the headquarters of the fleet, covered by riches, in La Paz.
In public buildings, there is a sea blue flag.
Float bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are over painted with the motto: "The sea is ours, it is a right.
It's a duty to take it back."
In the entire country of Bolivia, a coastal distance that was lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the 19th century remains strong, and the same is the longing for sailing in the Pacific.
The hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of vote.
"Bolivia has momentum, a feeling of community and clarity, and, of course, waits with a positive look at the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large-scale screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Court will support Bolivia in the fact that Chile, after several decades of discussions, is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area of access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s Carismatic President, who faces a controversial election fight next year, has also a lot at stake in the ruling on Monday.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific," he promised last August.
However, analyticals believe that it is unlikely that the Court will take Bolivia’s party – and that there would not be any major changes if it did.
The UN Assembly, which has seats in the Netherlands, has no power to overcome Chilean territory and has suggested that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court rejects judgment only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting Bolivia's case, the last four years may have been relapsed.
"The matter of access to the sea has been dealt with by the current Bolivian leadership," said Zárate.
Morales' warrioric retoric has done it off with the remaining Chilean welwilling, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at one time continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision was abnormally fast.
On Monday Bolivia will have "a extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "finish a age of 139 years with disagreements and gain advantages for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political cricket.
"Bolivia will never abandon the rights of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is not coming unless they can trust the United States
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never destroy their nuclear weapons if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He invited the United States to fulfil the promises given at a Singapore Summit between the rivalizing leaders.
His comments were made in addition to the fact that the American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo appears to be facing a restart of the closed nuclear diplomacy over three months after the meeting in Singapore with the Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says that it is a "wanted dream", to continue sanctions and the opposition of the United States to a declaration that ends the Korea War, will ever bring North Korea into the knees.
Washington is reluctant to the declaration, as long as Pyongyang has not taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and the American president Donald Trump want another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about the abolition of an arsenal that the country is most likely to see as the only thing that can guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris reveals the latest collections with great main clothing that you will soon be able to buy in local shops
If you want to increase your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted on the catwalk swallowed for a collection of remarkable head clothing in extra large size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unraktic hat has dominated on Instagram in summer, and the two designers have sent their impressive creations down by the catwalk.
The most impressed work from Valentino was an overdue with a far-like wide shadow covering the heads of the models.
There were also other extra large accessories, including water melons with jewels and even an ananas – but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time to Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had mixed lips that reminded more about Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creative looked like dolls with snorkels and masks, and others looked like a smelted vaffelis.
And if you continue the big fashion records, you're lucky.
Style peers predict that the huge hats could come to shops near you.
The fighting hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60 cm wide shadow, which has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
Cultural mark, which is behind the highest unraktic hat that was spread across the social media, has sent a new large creation down the catwalk – a beach bag in straw, almost as large as the model that shows it.
The orange bastack with sauces and a white leather handle was the most spectacular in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see great hats and beach bags in general shops next summer. The designer has had so much influence that it will be hard to ignore the demand for accessorys in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Individual schools in Scotland have many beautiful academic results behind themselves, and it continues in 2018 with a number of other outstanding exams, which are also strengthened by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can compose and implement a tailored pensum, we experience that modern language remains a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it hits the head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it hits the heart."
It is an important reminder that we cannot just stay to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can see the latest graduation results this year that languages are the highest in the statistics with most persistent degrees in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages got the high character A.
The data collected by SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of the students received the character A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important competences that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now considered to be subject choices at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools and elsewhere.
A study conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons why employers were not able to occupy vacancies, 17 % had to do with lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills become more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
In the future, more jobs will require language skills, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career youths choose, if they have learned a different language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skills like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a spring to competitors.
According to a YouGov Measurement with more than 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
That is why it is important to invest in language education for those who are children today.
When you can speak more languages, especially languages from developing countries, children give a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, schools differ between the languages of which are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important for the UK when looking forward to 2020, for example mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your child is interested, there will always be a number of languages to choose between independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Schott independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required for success, regardless of what the future offers.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the future of the country in a global business environment, and it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be regarded as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this expression to the youth of Scotland.
Il runs bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron receives debut for Lakers Sunday in San Diego
Waiting time is almost over for fans who will see LeBron James play his first fight for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton has announced that James plays in Sunday's opening fight before season starts against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's not yet determined how many minutes he's playing.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48," said Walton on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweete that James is most likely not to play the whole game.
After training earlier a week, James was asked for his plans in relation to Lakers' planned six matches before the season start.
"Where I am in my career, I don't have to fight before season start to get ready," he said.
Trump's voter meeting in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of voter meetings tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned election meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on confirmation of Trump's appointed Judge for the free seat at the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump is trying to create support for the coming midway elections because the Republicans are at risk of losing control over the Congress when the votes are issued in November.
When is Trump's choice meeting in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump's electoral meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be held at midnight (danish time) night between Saturday 29 November and Sunday 30 November 2018.
You can see Trump's choice meeting in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump is most likely to talk about this week's hearings about Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court. The hearings were tended because of accusations of sexually violent conduct, and the expected vote in the Senate on confirmation has been held in charge for a week while the FBI investigates the accusations.
However, the main objective of this series of voter meetings is to create momentum for the Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump's campaign team said that the five election meetings next week aimed at "creating energy among volunteers and supporting when the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the house of the representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible now that we enter the busy campaign time," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who would not be quoted by name, to Reuters.
The evening electoral meeting is held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump attendants from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by media from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month, Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican candidate to the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the opinions.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to get up to give him an boost in the opinions," said Simon Haeder, who is dealing with state science at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown battle spirit and is trying to keep hope alive before Sunday single duellers
After three unilateral rounds, Saturday's four-day duellers may have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating momentum pendul is a completely invented sport concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least by competition like this.
Where would they say there's momentum now?
"They led with six points, and now it's four, so we probably see it as a momentum," said Jordan Spieth before he held the four-foot.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead and there are 12 more points to play on.
As Spieth says, the Americans, however, feel that they have a little wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can prize with three points of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to the green and set a good example for his teammates.
The high cry of joy grew higher, as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important put that secured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two hits back after two duellers.
His trick, who guaranteed them the fight on hole 15 was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows that he does not think the American team is out of competition yet.
"You just need to find the inner strength forward and focus on your own struggle," said Spieth.
That's all the players have back now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the largest story from Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable, but sympathetic couple have received four points in four fights and appears to be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bookey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bookey's Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way energy appears to float both to and from the wild audience shows that it is them, it will be the hardest to strike Sunday, and it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory would be fixed by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Overall, synchronous on each of their holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process against Sergio Garcia, the morning all in the four-man's dolls, when he formed couples with Alex Noren.
A bookey and two double bookeys on the first nine holes digged the Spanish and Swedisher into a hole they were never near to get out.
Sunday, nobody can help you out of your hole.
The fights with four balls and two teams a two players are so fascinating to look closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played better as teams so far and has created a significant leadership before the last day, but the four-mends have also shown that the United States team has the fighter, which some have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe creates leadership of 10-6 before the last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a great advantage before the last day at Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a leadership over the United States of 10-6.
The well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the road with two victories over a difficult Tiger Woods and has so far got four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjørn's European team, who tried to win the pokal they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated over an unreasonable American team in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance in foursomes, won four battles, but was still backward.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points in Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the pocal.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant who has won four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have received the nickname "Molliwood" are after a sensational weekend the only second couple in Ryder Cup's history, who has won four points in their first four matches.
They broke Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then defeated elegantly a modless Woods and the American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who struggled through the first two battles Saturday, had little genius glimps, but now he lost 19 out of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in motion.
Justin Rose was well-relaxed to the morning's fourballs and returned to Henrik Stenson's partner in foursomes and got a 2-1-sea over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – which is number three in the world.
Europe, however, has the whole thing they want, on a lightly blowing day southwest of Paris.
Three-two major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way to the Americans with two points Saturday.
They got a hard-fighted 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and returned later and hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder Cup history that a team has struggled back after being back with four points before the single fights. However, since Furyks currently has the pokal, they only have to achieve it undecisively to keep it.
However, after being the second best for two days, they do not seem to be able to master a countervailing Sunday.
North Korea says they will not disarmament unilaterally if there is no confidence.
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions strengthen their mistrust to the United States and that the country will not give up their nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the Worldwide Organization that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" in the last year, e.g. by stopping nuclear and missile tests, developing an area for nuclear tests and laws not to further develop nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will take first steps and disarmament unilaterally."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "fase divided" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. However, his speech seemed important because it did not clearly reject unilateral disarmament, as it otherwise had been the case of Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint report from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit ever between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore 12 June, where Kim promised to work "atoom disarmament on the Korean island", while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has asked for a formal conclusion of the Korea war, which took place in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up their nuclear weapons.
Washington has also demonstrated opposition to bleeding up severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"USA insists on 'atomic disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their goals by force and even opposes 'the declaration of the end of the war'," said Ri.
"The notion that sanctions can bring us into our knees is a dream of desire among people who do not know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions strengthen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader of the United Nations mentioned earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If nuclear disarmament was to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so locked up."
Nevertheless, the tone in Ris' speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the firing of North Korea's missiles against the U.S. continent was inevitable, after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocked man" on suicide mission.
Last year, Trump in the United Nations threatened the "total destruction" of North Korea, but this year he commended Kim to show courage in relation to disarmament, but said that there is still a lot to be done and that the sanctions must remain until North Korea is down.
On Wednesday Trump said that he had no timetable for these actions, but said, "It's no matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council must maintain the sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve the total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's missile and nuclear weapon programme.
Pompeo met Ri at the sideline during the UN General Assembly and subsequently said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that there had been progress, while North Korea only a few hours after he was accused of putting "gathering demands."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to close a missile plant and a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent steps".
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent steps", he demanded, were the safety vows that Trump gave in Singapore, as well as movements against a normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all bachelor students more sleep. The goal of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture, where studying throughout the night kept up of large amounts of caffeine.
A researcher has shown that students at the world's best university often do not know the first thing to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which, he thinks, is the first of his kind in the United States.
He got the idea of the course after having held an edition about the effects of a lack of sleep on learning.
"When the record was finished, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I have this first to know now when I am on the candidate?"
"She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains how good sleep habits can improve your academic and sports performance as well as your overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health field, says that the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in a serious need for sleep during the week.
The hour-long course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a college room where students need to click on coffee cups, gardins, runshoes and books to get knowledge of the effects of caffeine and light, and how their sports performance is influenced by a lack of sleep and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how a long time lack of sleep increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map over campus.
"We know that it will not change the conduct of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know it - as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride that is taking a "allnights" still exists, he says and adds that modern technology and increased pressure on students has led to a growing problem of sleeping.
The "secret weapon" against stress, fatigue and anxiety is good and enough sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain, because a lack of sleep makes the brain think that you are hungry, why they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California studying chemical and physical biology, last year Professor Czeisler helped to organize the course when he took one of his courses in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a general course at the entire university.
He hopes that the next will be that all graduates will be offered a similar course before they continue their training.
Professor Czeisler recommends the students to set an alarm so they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create consciousness of the harmful effects of the light from electronic screens that can go through the dayspace and make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Measures from Menga lower Gerrard and co.
Rangers suffered another defeat on the outside, when Dolly Mengas goals meant that Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team had to thank with a defeat of 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was out after their first victory on the outdoor since the 4-1 triumph of St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard the only second defeat in 18 battles as a trainer. So there are eight points up to Hearts at the first place of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team couldn't reply to.
Rangers now go down to a sixth place, while Livingston climbs up on a third place after Hibernian with only the target score to the difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to Rangers, as line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head of a cast object that seemed to come from the outdoor section.
Gerrard made eight changes in the design that reached Betfed Cups semifinale by tonsing past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, stood with the same 11 who barred a point of Heart's leadership last week, and he would have been pleased to see his sharp team tired the opponents over the entire course.
Rangers had the ball most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes in the fight, when Mengas' first delivery sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goals, but the midway player's attempts passed over.
A free park in the depth of Keaghan Jacobs found the way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense player Alan Lithgow fired by the backstone.
However, Rangers took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attack game.
Alfredo Morales was, at least, not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson recognised the columbian's appeals about criminal park when he and Steven Lawless broke together after a quarter of game.
Rangers achieved only two shots on targets in the first half, but former Rangers measurer Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head hit and Ovie Ejaria's tamme shots.
Although the opening of Livis in the 34th minute was something random, it must be said to be deserved for their efforts alone.
Again, Rangers couldn't handle a deathball situation in the depth of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took time to find Menga, who could easily kick it in target.
In the break, Gerrard Coulibaly replaced with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave pots, when the flyer sent the ball into Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the team to play on their premises with many long balls on the road from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's crew could have expanded the leadership in the last part of the battle, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed next to the goals.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton again appealed to a late criminal park after being dried with Jacobs, but judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: Inventor of the geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sonday Morning": 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago – if we tell... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a invention that in the long term would lead to the device known as the gig teller.
The Geiger Counter has become a solid element of both science and popular culture, as it could be seen in the film "Bells of Coronado" from 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had the main roles as German scientists:
Man, "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you take on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity of the minerals produces."
Evans, "Hold up, now it's going on!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he wanted to fill 63.
But the invention that wears his name is alive.
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune defense to recognize cancer cells in the course of treatment
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them into the laboratory.
They can then "see" the protein that is common to many cancer forms and where they are injected again
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a number of cancer forms.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune defense to recognize cancer cells, cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and changing them into the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein named HER2, as many cancers have, and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "has several forms of cancer to develop," including breast, egg, lung and intestinal cancer, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach in which immune cells are taken from patients and "learner" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West held Trump-friendly speech with a MAGA hat after his SNL appearance.
It didn't work well.
After an inconsistent appearance in the Saturday Night Live Study, Kanye West was buried off when he commended the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and said that he himself would stand up as presidential candidate in 2020.
When he had played the third song of the evening Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again case, he began to speak against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
"I'm talking so often to white people who say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's racist?'
But if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from the United States for a long time," he said.
SNL started the evening show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star laughed with Brett Kavanaugh's witness statement in the Senate's Judgment Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's supreme assault.
Although the recordings were not shown, the competitor Chris Rock Wests uploaded the tirades on the social media.
It's uncertain if Rock tried to post West by putting up the recordings.
West also complained to the audience about bad treatment backstages because of his head clothing.
"They pushed me backstairs.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat."
They knocked me!
And they said that I was sucking deeply," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Would you see how deep I'm sunk?" and said that he would take on his Superman cap because it means that "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try with love."
The audience buhed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassed, explains Variety with a comment from a person who was present: "There was bombing in the study."
West had been booked as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose then girlfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by acting with the song in Love It while he was dressed out like a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous people: NOT TAKE YOU KUE OF PUBLEN."
Talkshow host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just like he is, and it's fine.
"But I don't choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes or supporting his "kunst") that embraces and sheds an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And we have, too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had taken a change of name to the "unit that is officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who has changed the name, and thereby follow Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapkollegaen Snoop Dogg has called Snoop Lion, and the recently dead musical legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.

Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington extends to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor extends to the stereotypical macho hero and says that this kind of TV characters means that young men often feel that they need to be hard to be respected.
Kit said to Sunday Times Culture that he thinks that there's been "something wrong" and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently got married to his Game of Thrones-medstar Rose Leslie on 31, admitted that the problem lies in his mind.
"Today, I am very concerned – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?" he said.
"If we look at the current problems, what is it that we have learned young men in their growing up?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculin characters.
He continued, "What is born, and what is inherited?
What are the young men learning from the television and on the street that makes them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think that is one of our time's major questions – how do we change it?
For it is obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men."
During the interview he also admitted that he will not make successors to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, and said that he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
Kit contributes from November to a replay of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film instructor and his brother, who is a thief.
The scholar recently revealed that he considers it to meet his wife Rose as the best at the entire Game of Thrones experience.
"I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, like Kits character, Jon Snow, becomes in love in the Emmy Award winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslies family landing in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has published a 14% increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, says the health authorities.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 40,000 new cases were recorded.
Most of the new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV rapidly spread in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who receive HIV in this way has been reduced to something nearly zero, Chinese health authorities report at a conference in Yunnan Province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China's LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was legalised in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT persons is supposed to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men are married earlier or later with women due to the conservative values of the country.
Many infectious cases are due to the lack of use of prevention in these circumstances.
Since 2003, China's government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff devoured data on Republican senators and twisted against "threatening lies" and "conspiration theorys"
Member of the House of Representatives Maxine Waters denied in Saturday's accusations that a member of her staff has shared personal information on three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claimed that the claims were from websites and support from "the extreme right-wing".
"Lyes, lies and more terrible lies," said Waters in a Twitter look.
The published information was reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers on the American senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was placed on the Internet on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill. This happened during a hearing in the Senate deliberating accusations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court's nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak happened after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses pointed out that the information had been posted by Waters' people, then they published information about a member of a Water Stab, writes The Hill.
"This unjustified accusation is completely untruthful and a direct lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, is in no way responsible for this deck of information.
This unjustified accusation is totally unfair and a direct lie."
Waters' statement was rapidly criticized online, including from former press secretary in the White House Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," wrote Fleischer.
"It indicates that she does not have the right temperament to be a Congress member.
If you get accused of something you haven't done, you don't have to get angry.
You shouldn't be detestable.
You must not question the motives of the accuser.
You have to keep your mind calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Kavanaugh, who was criticized to be too angry during Thursday's consultation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who aims to take over Waters' place in the midway election, also announced his opinion on Twitter.
"Stort, if it's true," he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says that her staff has contacted "the relevant authorities and order forces regarding these fraudulent claims."
"We will ensure that the offenders are found," she continued. "And they will be kept legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all and everyone in my staff."
Review of Johnny English hits again – undermining spy comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the standard to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British islet, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will sarcastian self-satisfaction be the new export option of the country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber view and the great eyes have been allowed to make the brewers again and again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic finding directed to places where the cinema visitors don't speak English.
He is of course the stumbling secret agent, who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a little Clouseau, a knife pit Mr. Bean and proper climb of him who performed a single tone to Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of OL in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the world-wide and international luce bowl that left chaos in his cool water after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television advertising.
There are some good moments in this last shot on the tribe of YE.
I loved when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval rustle, and the propellers sounded at his helmet.
You can see Atkinson's talent for physical comics, but the humor feels quite subtle and weirdly excessive, especially now that more "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also offers convincing comic as an ingredient.
The humor appears to be addressed to children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's crazy adventure is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's stumfilms in the role of Mr. Bean.
The infinitely current starting point of the film is that the United Kingdom is in a serious situation.
A internet hacker has infiltrated England's top secret spy network and revealed the identity of all the English agents in the field of terrifying the responsible agent – a very small role to Kevin Eldon.
This is the last chance for a pompous and champion Prime Minister who is already suffering a complete demolition in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing its best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the manuscript.
As her security advisers inform her that each active spy has been revealed, she is required to cancel anybody's pension.
And of course, it is the stupid Johnny English, who is now a school inspector at a high school, but who in hiding teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some fun sequences here when English stands for a kind of school of Rock training in spionage.
English is pressed back to a crisis meeting at Whitehall and reunited with its hardly tested former right hand Bough, which is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an overenthusiastic but prosperous submarine – a role that Vicki Pepperdine was lost on.
Thus, the Royal Intelligence Service's Altogether Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatal, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is snailing closely to being impressed by the carismatic and horrible tech-milliard Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England's computer problems.
English and Bough start their angry risky eskapads: Predressed as servants they put fire to a pleasant French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok, as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to make himself familiar with Volta's house.
All the cannons are fired in the final sequence of the film, but regardless of how prosperous and energetic it is, there is a sense of child vision about it.
Right medium-sized.
And as I couldn't avoid thinking with the other Johnny English films: Can't the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that gives his talent justice?
Labour refuses to barsle with plans for four days working week with unchanged wages to the British
Jeremy Corbyns Labour is said to consider a radical plan so that the English can only be a four-day working week, but get a five-day pay.
The party claims to have business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give the employees an additional Friday.
That would mean that the employees would have three days of weekend without paying down.
Sources argue that the idea would be in line with the party's economic goals to draw the country in a more favourable direction for workers.
Trade Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from a change in economy.
A experienced member of the Larbour Party said to The Sunday Times: "A political proposal is expected to be published before the end of the year."
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is a goal that suits the party's approach to changing the economy to the benefit of workers and to the overall strategy of the party for industry."
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day working week during the election campaign for the parliamentary elections in 2017.
However, the objective is not unanimously supported by the Labour Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour Minister for Shadow Finance John McDonnell used last week's party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell claims that he is determined to take power back from "anonym directors" and "users" in supply companies.
The Shadow Finance Minister's plans also question whether the current shareholders of water supply companies will get their money back, as a government with Labour at the top could "recover" them on the basis of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to get workers in business boards and to establish, including ownership funds, which will distribute 10 per cent of private enterprises' share value to employees who will receive up to 500 pounds per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if the FBI's study of Kavanaugh can change their voice
The FBI survey on accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has shot the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and it raises the question of whether the FBI's findings could make the Republican senators draw their support.
In a Sunday interview, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig something that could make them change their position.
Kennedy seemed to be more open to the idea than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"When I entered the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, "Did you do it?"
He was stolen, determined and unambiguous."
On the other hand, Graham’s voice seems to be mesh in stone.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and else would require a very violent accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that Brett denied it at the strongest," Graham added with reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of them she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can't see that it's supposed to change anything."
What is Global Citizens Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York is a host city for Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive range of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
Global Citizens Festival will for the seventh time receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park's great spots, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will draw attention to the real goal that is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of Global Poverty Project, an international interest organisation, which struggles to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concert gangsters must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, make voluntary work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or other meaningful action that can draw attention to the goal of making a end to poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years left to reach the goal?
Creates the idea of rewarding people with a free concert real change, or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" – i.e. that people feel that they make a difference by signing a subscription collection online or making a Twitter recording?
Global Citizen notes that since 2011 they have registered over 19 million "actions" from their members aimed at different targets.
They believe that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make binding goals and political action equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which is expected to have influenced more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions that had become due to their actions, which ran up in more than 10 billion dollars, which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main objectives is The Power of Nutrition, which has been launched in England and is a cooperation between investors and trade strong people. They strive to "help children to live their full potential" and promise 35 million dollars to remedy food problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4.700 seconds from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the English government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with underernation can become a footnote in the history books," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ulman, to the audience by a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that England's government has now promised funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with advice on nutrition.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions of the website, which says: "What makes you think that we can put an end to extreme poverty?",
Written Global Citizen: "It will be a long and hard fight, and sometimes we will fall and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the movements against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are among the performers of this year's festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman must be hosts.
The United States can use its fleet to "block" for Russian energy sports, says the U.S. Home Minister.
"If necessary" Washington can use its fleet to prevent Russian energy from getting into the market, also in the Middle East, reveals the US Minister of Home Affairs, Ryan Zinke, to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s interference in Syria, especially where they operate on the invitation of the legal government, is a prompt to expand the sale of their energy.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he must have said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
"The US has with our fleet the opportunity to ensure that there is free passage on the seaways, and if necessary, we can also block them, so that their energy does not come on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance – a non-profit organisation that considers itself "the voice of the American energy consumption".
He compared Washington's approaches to deal with Russia and Iran and said that they are in the bottom and the ground.
"The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about to exploit and replace fuel," he said, as he referred to Russia as a "one-trick pony", whose economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration aimed at increasing European exports of liquid natural gas to replace Russia, which is far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, speakers of the Trump Administration, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 management project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin to Moscow's "fish".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 line, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
Kreml believes that Washington's strong opposition to the project is an expression of inequal competition and simply due to economic considerations.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose supplier," said the Russian Minister of Energy, Aleksandr Novak, at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with the US Energy Minister, Rick Perry, in September.
The position of the Americans meets with criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, BDI, has asked the United States to intervene outside the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem with a third party being involved in our energy supplies," said the leader of the BDI, Dieter Kempf, after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "thinks strongly" to stand up to the presidential election in 2020, says the Senator of Massachusetts
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren "thinks strongly" to postpone the presidential election after the midway election, she said Saturday.
During a city Council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about setting up.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front," said the Hill.
"After 6 November, I'm going to think very much about putting up the presidential elections."
Warren announced his opinion on President Donald Trump during the City Council and said that he "leading the country in the wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren has been expressed in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh.
On a two- Friday, Warren wrote, "By the way, the FBI has to investigate the matter before the vote."
However, a Thursday review shows that the majority of Warren's own backland does not believe that she should be set up in 2020.
According to a opinion of Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58% of the "probable" choosers in Massachusetts said that the senator should not set up.
32% supported the possible candidateship.
The meaning measurement showed greater support to former governor Deval Patrick by 38% for and 48% against a possible design.
Other high-profiled democratic candidates who are discussed in connection with the presidential election in 2020 are among other former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
The Bien claims that he will communicate his final decision in January, writes the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palins PTSD at a voter meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was a year in Iraq after joining the army in September.
On Monday night he was arrested and accused of violence at home.
"What my own son is going through after he has come home, makes me be able to relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other damages our soldiers return home with," she told the audience to a Trump chooser meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans, "they have changed and have become harder. They go and think whether there is respect for what their colleagues in the country and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of violence at home against a woman, to prevent the notification of violence at home and to be in possession of a gun in a drunk state, tells Dan Bennet, a spokesman of the police in Wasillas.
18 States and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 States and districts of Columbia support a legal objection against a new US law which refuses asylum to victims who flee from violence or violence at home.
Representatives from the 18 States and D.C. delivered on Friday in Washington a party-dependent declaration to support an asylum applicant who opposes the law, says NBC News.
The full name of the applicant in the case of Grace vs. Sessions, submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal law, has not been published.
She claims that her partner "and his violent sons who are band members" had abused her, but American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state charges that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of American asylum seekers originate, as countries with widespread problems of bands and violence at home.
The new US asylum legislation rejected a decision made by the U.S. Foreign Affairs Board in 2014, allowing undocumented immigrants who fled from violence at home to seek asylum.
District of Columbia State Advocate, Karl Racine, said on Friday that the new law "is beyond the state, federal and international law of decades."
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be determined on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such a obstacle is contrary to that principle," states the party-dependent declaration.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law of rejecting immigrants harms the US economy, since it is more likely that they become independent and "lever the necessary labour force."
In June, Minister of Justice, Jeff Session's immigration judges dismissed the right to give asylum to victims who flee from domestic violence and violence.
"Asyl is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or a political standpoint," said Sessions in its announcement of the Law on 11 June.
It has never been meant that asylum should remedy all problems – or just all serious problems – that people all over the world face every day.
While the death rate is doubled, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate
For survivors, the situation was only worse.
"It's very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while comforting her little fever-shaped boy at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with bodies.
We need clean water."
The inhabitants returned to their ruined homes to sort in bleeding possessions and save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, which were also affected by the 7.5 earthquake, could not follow.
Some of the damaged ones, including Dwi Haris, who broke their back and shoulder, were outside Palus’s military hospital, where patients are treated outdoorly due to severe aftercrowding.
He got tears in his eyes when he told us how the violent earthquake shake the hotel room in the fifth room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was stuck up against a ruined wall, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and added that his family was going to marry in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of unfine methods and propaganda advertisements
A week after a Chinese newspaper brought a four-sided ad in an American newspaper that struck drums for the advantages of American-Chinese cooperation, the American ambassador in China Beijing accuses of using the American press to spread propaganda.
The US President, Donald Trump, referred on Wednesday to China Dailys paid entrance in Des Moines Register – Iowas best selling newspaper – after accusing China to interfere in the Congress elections of 6 November. China rejects the accusation.
U.S. officials say to Reuters that Trump's accusation of Chinese interference in the US elections marks a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked up in an escalating trade war, where they have put customs duties on each other's imports.
China’s reimbursement duties in the trade war would affect exporters in States such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of Trump, believe Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, American ambassador in China, former governor for a number of years in Iowa, a large exporter of agricultural foods to China, said that Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
Branstad wrote in a leader of the Sunday Des Moines Register that China "step up the use of the unfine methods by driving propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government uses the proud American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of press by driving a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, however, there will be only few disagreements, and you will not get a reasonable picture of the Chinese people's different positions on China's worrying economic direction, as the media are under strike control from the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers did not publish" his article, although he didn't say what.
Republicans promote women before the mid-term election with the Kavanaugh case, warn analyticals
While many top-republics support and defend the Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh against accusations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that they will experience a reaction in the next mid-term election, especially from women.
The case has put the emotions into the cooking, and most Republicans have already published that would like to see the vote process continue.
"This can't be done again," said Grant Reher, professor of state expertise at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article on Saturday.
Reher said that he doubts that the Republican senator Jeff Flakes (Arizona) requests for a FBI survey in 11 hours will milden anger elections.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday – they don't forget it tomorrow or November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, who is senior advisor and national speaker of the progressive group MoveOn, according to The Hill in Friday.
On Friday morning the demonstrators shouted during a demonstration at the Senate: "November is coming!" when the Republicans, who control the judicial committee, chose to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the witness statement of Professor Christine Blasey Ford, says Mic.
"The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new height," told the independent political commentary Stu Rothenberg to the news media.
"The people say it has already reached a high level; it is true.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female swingers in the forst cities and younger electorate – 18-29 - who rarely vote, despite not to like the President."
Even before Ford's public accusations of the sexual abuse of the Supreme Court had analytics pointed out that if the Republicans continued with the nomination, it could be rejected.
"It has become a worse root for the Republicans," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or the final outcome, or about Kavanaugh's responsibility; it's also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they've treated it," points Guy Cecil, chairman of the Priorities USA – a group that supports Democrats in being elected – to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to have shared views on whom to believe in after the Ford and Kavanaugh witnesses, where the latter have a little more on their side.
A new statement from YouGov shows that 41% of the respondents believed in Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they believed in Kavanaugh certainly or probably.
In addition, 38% said that they believed that Kavanaugh was either probably or certainly lying during its testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After a call from Flake, the FBI now investigates the accusations submitted by Ford and at least one other, Deborah Ramirez writes for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate's court committee last week under the oath that Kavanaugh was fully committed to her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominator showed her gender to a party when they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, launches a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology theme is Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the plan of Inrupt is "world reign".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup business.
"It's a historical moment."
The app uses Solids technology so that people can make their own "personal online data collection" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, two-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique in the personal online data collection is that it is up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it "personal power through data".
The idea of Inrupt is to collect resources, processes and ability to make Solid available to all, according to the company's executive director, John Bruce.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps by using the available tools on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook or Google about whether to change it completely, so all their business models suddenly become excessive."
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a look at the Medium this Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupts "mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he started World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important vote in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will still be inventor and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredible optimistic about the next period of the Internet," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Spiritual receiver of the Victoria Cross from World War 1 was celebrated
The only priest of the English church who won the Victoria Cross by fighting during the First World War is celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Lieutenant and priest Bernard Wann won the order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a snigskytt and never got to know that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday a memorial was revealed by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said that it was "unbelievable symbolic", that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's order-winning operation.
According to London Gazette, Colonel Lieutenant Vann on September 29, 1918 led his bataljon over Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very thick dick and under heavy shooting from machine guns and artillery."
Later he ran forward to the front line and led his people with the "greatest man's courage" before he only attacked a artillery and injured three canons.
Lieutenant Vann was killed by a German snigskytt on October 4, 1918 – just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann of 72 said that his grandfather's actions were "something I knew I could never live up to, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother James Vann also laid a crown after the parade, which was listed by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "had felt very honourable to participate in the parade" and added that "the support from all these people emphasizes the true hero."
MMA fans got up all night to see Bellator 206, but instead Gurli Gris
Imagine that you have been upstairs all night to see the star-breaked Bellator 206 and then you will be refused to see the main event.
There were 13 battles on the San Jose program, including six matches on the main program, and they were shown the night through in England at Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m. when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet each other, the viewers in England became surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimponized after they had been awake to early morning for just this fight.
A fan on Twitter described it as a kind of sick joke.
"In law, this content was not appropriate at 6:00 a.m., why they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Bellator, when he was asked for the issue.
"Grisen Gurli, yes."
The Executive Director of Bellator, Scott Coker, stated that they would work to include English viewers in the future planning.
"When thinking about the recast, I think we can make it work," said Coker.
"But the clock is six Sunday morning there, and we don't find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on the case.
Believe me when the change was made, I got a lot of message, and they weren't all kind.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But that was actually the law.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We only had five fights instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had "underworth" over sexuality
The Olympic diving Tom Daley says that he felt less worthwhile than everyone else in his grown-up because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to gain success.
The 24-year-old said it didn't make him realize until he came in the bigger classes that "all aren't like me."
When he was at Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hope".
He also said that he was less involved in winning OL after being a parent.
The usual host of the radio program, which has been running for a long time, Kirsty Young, has taken off a few months due to disease.
Daley was a guest in Laverne's first program and said that he felt "less worth" than everyone else in his growing up, because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said: "From today the feelings of feeling memory worthwhile and feel different are the things that have given me the strength to succeed."
He would prove that he was "nothing," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they learned his sexuality to know.
The double Olympic bronze winner has become a highly profiled LGBT fighter and used its participation in this year Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalisation of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others "hope".
The three-fold world champion said that he had been "rashed" when he was in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he, but told him that the age difference had never been a problem.
He told me that it is difficult to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar up- and downturns when you go through so much in such a young age – he went to his first OL as 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later.
In June the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all if I should win a golden medal," he said.
"But there are more important things than Olympic Gold Medals.
My Olympic Gold Medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 as 40 years after diagnosing brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not accept that he should die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had received tickets to London 2012 – when he would sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that he wouldn't be there at that time.
I held his hand when his breath stopped, and it first came to me that he was not immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in OL 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life – dying in front of a home public at OL. There was nothing that could beat that feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – that had meant much during the recording to OL and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs runs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Uscarp Mickelson on the bean to Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson records on Sunday when he plays his 47th struggle in Ryder Cup, but he has to do something about the shape if it doesn't need to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets record for 12th time to participate in the competition, which is developed every 2 years, was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of the U.S. events as usual, the five - double big winning winning forces had to age and practice on their game in the hope of correcting the peaks.
Even not at the peak of the career he had the most straight drive, why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match to the Le Golf National, where the long rough often punishs miserable shots.
And if the course wasn't a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will meet the exact winner of British Open Francesco Molinari at the ninth battle on Sunday, who has joined the newborn Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, starting the 12 single fights, start strongly, Mickelson's fight can be crucial.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a lap on my back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a great faith in himself."
He is in Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and this week too.
I guess I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I imagined he was going to play more, but that's how it went, and that's what it was supposed to be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else."
On Sunday Mickelson Nick Faldos records for most played matches in Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never been able to measure completely with his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeat and seven unaffected, even though Furik said that his presence contributes with something unfinished.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes with much more than just the game."
Europe's captain Thomas Bjørn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
The European captain Thomas Bjørn knows from experience that a solid leadership before the last day of Ryder Cups single up can quickly become nervous.
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seven Ballesteros had a five-point front over the Americans, but was about to be picked up before the goal with a victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice leadership in Valderrama, we had a nice leadership in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just won," says Bjørn after seeing the 2018 team win both 5-3 Friday and yesterday to a total leadership of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's gonna have full garbage tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
It's not over until you have the points on the record.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win the trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are also aware of what stands on the other side – the best golf players in the world."
Enjoyed in the performance of his players on a difficult level, Bjørn added: "I don't take anything of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a completely new challenge.
Tomorrow it's the individual performances that count, and it's something different.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's good, but when you're out there alone, you're tested on all parameters as a golf player.
That's what players need to understand – get the best in yourself tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, because he must also get the best in himself."
On the other hand, it looks like the opponent Jim Furyk who hopes for better individual performances than in the partner game except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk has experienced co-turns on the last day. First on the winner team in Brookline before he lost when Europe made the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember every word," he said, when he was asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
"We have 12 important fights tomorrow, but you want a good start, as you saw by Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
Once the momentum has found a direction, it puts a great pressure on the intermediate fights.
We compose our team in relation to it and put the players on the track in the order we feel for. We try to create magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the relapse and face Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
"I chose this group of players in this order, because I think it ensures us all the way through," said Bjørn about his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship is re-established
The latest fregat of the German fleet should have been ready in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War. However, the Germans must wait at least one year on the basis of technical problems and an escalating price, writes local media.
The introduction of the largest ship in the entirely new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of fregattes, "Rheinland-Pfalz", has been emitted to the first half of 2019 according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting a spokesman from the military.
The ship should have become part of the fleet in 2014, but survival problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the fleet ordered back in 2007, shall replace the ageing freights from the Bremen class.
They know that they want a strong cannon, a large range of anti-air shoots and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the newest freights is a smaller need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the freights away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the repeated delays mean that the advanced war vessels – which, in the opinion of Germany, will appear as an overseas force factor – will already be older when they are put in, writes Die Zeit.
The failed F125 Fregat created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to use the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Vossyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the fleet delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
There was little knowledge of the reasons for returning, but German media mentioned a number of decisive "software and hardware errors", which made the warship unusual in battle situations.
Software errors were of particular importance, as the ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class must be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – it is only half of that crew from the older Bremen freights.
It also showed that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the capacity of the fleet for future updates.
The 7000 tonnes of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to hardware errors, the price of the project, which includes training of the crew, is also by becomeing a problem.
It is said to have reached faded 3.1 billion € (3.6 billion dollars), with an original price of 2.2 billion €.
The problems of the latest freights become even more important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's fleet force is crumbling.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Government Defence Committee, earlier this year admitted that the fleet "is unable to set up clear ships."
The official said that the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of use without being replaced.
He complained that none of the fregats from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class was ready to become part of the fleet.
National Trust sniglights to the secret life of the flagermus
New research from an area in the high-level Scotland is trying to reveal how flagermus uses the landscape when they hunt.
The hope is that the findings will cast light on the behavior of the unique, flying pet animals and will help in the work of future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from Scotland's National Trust and follows common flagermus, dwarf flagermus, long-eyed flagermus and water flagmus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected places in the area in order to record the activities of the flag muses through the season.
Data are also collected by NTS staff and volunteers by handheld detectors.
Depth analysis of the sound records will reveal the frequencies of the flag-muses calls and show what kind of what is doing.
In order to produce a detailed landscape picture of their behaviour, a report and a map are made over the habitat.
Nature storage adviser for NTS Rob Dewar hopes that the results reveal the most important areas of the habitat and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help to determine the benefits of habitat-saving efforts such as the establishment of spouses and the best conservation of forest areas for flagermus and similar species.
The number of flagermus in Scotland and the UK has fallen dramatically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects affecting the redders and restricting their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger.
Flagmus isn't really blind.
But because they're primarily hunting in the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use advanced ecolocation techniques to find insects and fly without obstacles.
NTS, responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flagermus very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect reds and sometimes make rescue actions.
The organization has even made Scotland's first and only dedicated flager muse reserve in the area of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home for eight out of ten of Scotland's flager muse species.
The owner of the area, David Thompson, says that it is an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a really good area for flagermus," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and the whole good habitat.
You are a lot, you don't know about flagermus, so work here and elsewhere can help to understand what they need to delight."
He emphasizes the importance of looking for flagermus before making maintenance tasks on property, as the destruction of a single cook can kill up to 400 females and young people, which risks destroying a whole local population.
Flagmus is peaced, and it is illegal to kill, blaspheme or disturb them or their reds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project leader of Bat Conservation Trust, has invited the public to give a hand with it.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flag mouse, and for many of the species we have, we don't know how the populations develop."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while lawyers prosecute German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charge against him as "failing news" and says that people "will promove themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to appeal to the German news media Der Spiegel, who brought the charges.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is claimed that he paid her $375,000 to keep it secret, wrote Der Spiegel on Friday.
Some hours after the claims had been published, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information to be "fair news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-fold winner of Ballon d'Or to the camera.
"They will promove themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and everything is good," added the player smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing for prosecution of Der Spiegel because of the accusations they have called, according to Reuters, "a unforgivable publication of suspicions on the private sector".
Advocate Christian Schertz says that the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class equivalent to the accusation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The event was reportedly held in June 2009 in a room at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After having met in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he must have raped her analyzed according to the reported report in the city court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell on the knee after the claimed incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" grip of "one percent".
The case documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and got photographed her damage in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "failing for remuneration" and worried about being "publicly shamed".
The 34-year-old now says that she will violate the agreement, as she is still deeply affected by the claimed incident.
Ronaldo faced a shift from Manchester United to Real Madrid, when the event had to take place, and changed in summer to the Italian big club Juventus for 100 million €.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Great Britain "will regret it forever," if it lost its status as the leading car manufacturer worldwide after Brexit, said Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "interesting" that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily reduce production at Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that longer waiting time at the border in case of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyotas Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% of them were exported to the rest of the EU.
"As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the United Kingdom goes out of the EU at the end of March," said the Executive Director at Burnaston, Marvin Cooke.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, express fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on trade over the border.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturers has to deal with risks with the supply chain in the event of no agreement.
Toyota's production runs on a tight timetable where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, there could be problems at the border that, according to the car industry, could lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than one day production at Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped, the company said.
Clark says that Theresa Mays Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "combined so that it is precisely avoided at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that does not allow us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success but to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The statements from Toyota and other manufacturers point out that we have to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would have stopped, but in the longer term, higher prices would reduce the competitiveness of the factory, which will eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a common truster at the factory, says that his members become more and more concerned: "My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they will not come again."
A spokesman of the government said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's important meeting with the Vice-President of Justice Rod Rosenstein can "blive shot a week more", when the recorded around the Supreme Court's nominated Brett Kavanaugh continues, said the White House in Sunday.
Rosenstein looks at the special accuser Robert Mueller over the shoulder during his study of Russian elections, links between Trump's helpers and Russia and the President's possible obstacle to the course of the court.
Whether Trump will fire the Vice-President of Justice and thus risk Mueller's independence, has been a dirty subject in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of posting the president through paragraph 25.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But the last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumour went on that he would say up.
Instead, a meeting was agreed on Thursday with Trump, which was at the time in the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said that he would "not prefer" to fir Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a collapse with Senate's court hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual abuse, should witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh, which delayed Senate's elections.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date fixed. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that happens in the Supreme Court.
But we need to see, and I like always to keep the press updated."
Some journalists would challenge the claim: Sanders have not held a press meeting in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press meetings was not due to the games of TV journalists for the gallery, but added: "I don't agree that they play up to the camera."
She said that the direct contact between Trump and the press will be increased.
"The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him," she said and added without quoting a source: "We've looked at the numbers."
Press meetings will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the President of the United States, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to give a rich opportunity for this, and you have seen us do this over the last few weeks, and it will be in the place of the press meeting when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open hearings or press meetings with high guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made an improvised and sometimes mysterious figure in front of the present journalists.
Health Minister contacts EU healthcare professionals after Brexit concerns
The Minister for Health has written to the EU Staff working in Scotland's NHS to express its gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the European Union.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to pay for the applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the European Union have continued in the summer, and it seems that decisions are expected for the autumn.
However, the British Government has also increased their preparation for a possible Brexit without an agreement.
I know it must be a very uncertain period for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I appreciate the efforts each member has done, regardless of their nationality.
Collectives from and outside the European Union have valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare to the benefit of patients and local communities.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we really want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie gets acute surgery after head injury
The line back from Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was urgently surgery after having suffered a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 downfall to Vanderbilt Commodores, it reads from Tennessees Mike Organ.
First trainer of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told journalists that the event took place before the break.
"He went out to the sideline and just fell over there," said Reed.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they put him on a bear and took him into further investigation.
A spokesman from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombies operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are no "no details about the type or extent of damage yet", and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he was injured.
Abercrombie is studying in the second year and is on its first season in Tennessee State after a shift from Illinois.
He had five assaults on Saturday before he left the battle, which gives him 18 assaults collected this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp tax when buying houses in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK. The additional money is to help the homeless according to the conservative party.
This move must minimize Corbyn's success in attracting young choosers.
The higher stamp tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to provide 120 £ million a year for the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp tax when buying properties in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The drag will be considered as an attempt to respond to Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young choosers with promises of cheaper housing and following them with the highest income.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The extra fee, which is added to the current stamp tax and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and purchases to rent, can reach 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to collect 120 £ million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new constructions in London are purchased by people living in abroad, making prices rise and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot in the home market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of the time outside the country.
The new legislative proposal comes only weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in the stamp tax to make it easier for young people to buy their first homes.
He accused large construction and construction companies to keep the property prices up by buying reasons they do not use. He asked May to drop the quotas on cheap housing to solve the "shamful housing situation of the UK."
Corbyn has proposed a spectacular range of housing reforms, including the control of rent prices and the withdrawal of the tenant's opportunity to put people on the street if they comply with the rental contract.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing buildings.
May said: "The last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who will live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be that it is as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy housing as too hard-working British.
For all too many, the dream of possession of a home has become far away, and the inferiority of sleeping on the street is still too widespread."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to become Scotland's trainer"
The boss of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says that his "ultimate goal" is at a time to become Skotland's trainer.
The 42 shot enjoys the challenge of resurrecting the club from North East, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He switched to the Stadium of Light this summer after having led St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a fight with the B team, and that was it," said Ross BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland on the Hampden with my father when I was a child, and it has always drawn in me.
However, that option would only arise if I succeeded in training clubs."
Ross' predecessors for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former trainer for Alloa Athletic says that he had no doubts about following such established names in such a large club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success from whether 'I can get this club back in the Premier League.'
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not a easy task, but I'll probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there."
Ross is only three years in the career that trains after a period of assisting training at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart’s training staff.
Then he helped Alloa come back after being moved down into the third best row and transformed St Mirren from the entrance threat to title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more suitable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real divorce," he remembers the time in Alloa.
"I sincerely thought that the training work was the right thing for me, more correct than being a player.
That sounds weird because I did fine, served reasonablely and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There's a lot of things you're going through on a weekly basis.
There's still such stress and pressure that trains, but it just feels right.
I always wanted to train, and now I do. I haven't felt more comfortable with myself throughout my adult life."

The best time for a beer is Saturday at 17.30 p.m., shows a study
The hot wave this summer has increased earnings for England's pupper, but has put restaurant chains under greater pressure.
The sale of pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while the sale in restaurants has decreased 4.8%, shows figures.
Peter Martin, who is CGA's business consultant and has collected the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpected long VM have meant that July follows June's pattern, where the pubbers experienced more sales of 2.8%, except that the restaurants are more affected now.
The fall of 1.8% in the restaurants in June only became worse in July.
Pubber and bars focused on the sale of drinking products made it the best and experienced progress similar to the restoration of the restaurants.
Pubber with focus on food led in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
Looks like people just want something to drink.
The sale of drinking products increased by 6.6% for the month across pub and bar chains, while food fell by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service industry, said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales on the out-of-house market, the weather and large social or sport events are the most important factors.
It is not surprising that the restaurants are still fighting, although a decrease in sales of 4.8% years by year will hurt the rise in costs.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we've had in August will give a hardly demanded puster."
The total increase in sales total for puppers and restaurants including new openings was 2.7 % in July, which shows the fall in newly started fires.

Every fifth child has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents
Each fifth child – up to 11 years – has secret accounts on social media, which they hide from their parents and teachers, shows a study.
A study of 20,000 school students in the 4 to 9th class reveals growth in "false Insta" pages.
The news has increased the fear of adding sexual content
20% of the students said they have a "head account", as they can show their parents
Every fifth child up to 11 years creates accounts on the social media they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from 4th class and forward reveals violent growth in "false Insta" accounts – a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The news has increased the fear of adding sexual content.
20% of the students said they have a "head account", which they can show their parents while they also have private accounts.
A mother who fell over the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, saw a teenager who invited others to "ramble me."
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference for Private Schools (HMC) found that 40 % of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, of which half of them granted private accounts.
The leader of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: "It's terrible that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the Board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Management Board of Scottish Athletics at the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most winning athletics practitioner, and President Ian Bettie described as a good opportunity for those who make decisions on sports to benefit from her great 10-year experience at international level.
"Eilidh enjoys a great view in the athletetic world in Scotland, Great Britain and the rest of the world, and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I will try to be the voice of the athletes, and I hope I can contribute and help to expose a direction for sport in Scotland."
The American, who won two of his four OL gold medals in the 200- and 400-meter races at the OL in Atlanta in 1996, which is now often a commentary for BBC, could not go after a transient ischemical attack.
On Twitter he wrote: "A month ago, I was hit by a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time would show if I would get up to it and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am completely healthy, I have learned to go again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pump comparing mothers with cows gets mixed receiver online
A breast pump company has shared the opinions online with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers with cows that are painted.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be "the world's first soundless breast pump", the technological consumer magazine has published a sarcastic music video-inspired advertising that will show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dances in a costume filled with chie, for a song, in which it says, "Yes, I male myself, but you see no hail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, this isn't outer, it's my breasts."
"Push it out, pump it out, I feed my child, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my barm."
But the advertising, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has led to controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed receipt from the viewers. Many say that it makes laughing with the "wheel" of the milk industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and feed before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth," wrote one user.
The breast pump from Elvie fits discretely in an amm-bh (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: "Intelligently, it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Another added: "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement. A woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I would have had one.
Breathing made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "It is a fun advertisement directed to mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or toilets) and feel like 'cows'.
It is not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discrete pumps in their bhs.
The concept behind the advertising is based on that many women who are breast-feeding say that they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no pipe or snakes and fits discretely in an amm-bh, which gives women freedom to move, keep their children and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner and director of Mother, wrote: "Pumpen from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a dreadful and provoking launch.
By dragging a parallel between breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while in an entertaining and recognized way we showed the freedom that the new pump can give."
It's not the first time that the pump from Elvie has created headlines.
In London Fashion Week a mother went to two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children in secret moved to tent camp at Texas border
The number of retained migrant children has exploded, although the number of borderers has not changed. This is partly due to a harder retoric and the tramp administration's scratching laws that make it more difficult to place children in sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared their possibility of staying in the country by standing up and receiving a child.
The home shipping risk increased in June, when the authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult household members should give fingerprints and that these data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, witnessed the Congress and told them that they had arrested several people who sought to sponsor unleashed minors.
The management later confirmed that 70 % of the arrested had pure penal assurances.
"That is 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors' households who are illegally reside in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we continue to hunt those people," said Albence.
In attempting to deal with the children's cases faster, the authorities have introduced new rules which require some of them to meet in court within a month of their retention.
Many use video calls instead of meeting themselves and speaking their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are judged unjustified to stay are deported quickly.
The longer children stay in guard, the more likely there is that they get anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or attempts to escape, it says from helpers and in reports that have come from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better relationships say that these risks are more pronounced in larger plants such as Tornillo, where the size makes it more difficult to observe if a child suffers.
They added that the transfer to a tent country town without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can pick up traumas with which many are already fighting.
Syria informs U.S., French and Turkish "occupying forces" that they should move immediately.
When the Syrian Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem, spoke to the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in his eighth year.
Moualem, also Vice-President, said that the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the presumption of combating terrorism, and they will "come with equivalent resources."
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions," he said to the Assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war against terror "near is over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have escaped from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight this decisive war until we have cleaned out all Syrian areas” for both terror groups and“ilgal foreign presence”.
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily trains and advises Kurdish and Syrian-Arabic forces, who are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-shaped country.
In the area of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough to return home, then he accused "some Western countries" to "sprinkle unfounded fear", which led the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate these returnes," he said.
"They police what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Syria establishing a buffer zone in the last large rebel-controlled city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political discussions.
Based on the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack was avoided by Syrian forces supported by Russia against the province where three million lives.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action would follow the jihadists from the Nusrafront, a starting group of Al-Qaeda, which "will be destroyed".
The United Nations missionary Staffan de Mistura hopes to call on the first meetings of the new committee to clarify a post-war Constitution for Syria and to set the way for a election.
Moualem has set conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the committee and states that the panel's work should be limited to "to review the legislation of the present Constitution" and warned against interference.
That is why Trump wins another presidential period.
From this logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the Kingdom Court and the scandals end his presidency period in advance, which many liberal viewers probably hope for.
In what undoubtedly becomes "The most dramatic end of a presidential period ever!"
At present there is no sign of seeing fatigue.
Since 2014, the viewers in the best time of sending have almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time to compare with 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBCs The Rachel Maddow Show has most viewers with up to 3.5 million in the evenings with great news.
"It is a spectacle that people are attracted by because it's nothing we understand," said Neal Baer, who leads the ABC Drama Designated Survivor on a leader of the cabinet, who becomes president after an attack destroys the convention building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedie writer and writer bag "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has another theory.
She remembers a taxi in Boston before the elections in 2016.
The driver told her he'd vote on Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"He said, 'Cause he makes me laugh,' said Scovell.
The Caosset has the entertainment value.
But in contrast to all other television programmes, the stories coming from Washington can decide the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
To change the channel is only the most privileged envy.
And yet, it's about more than being informed citizens when you see six hours of panel debate, where experts discuss Bob Woodward's use of "deep background", when he wrote his book "Fear"; Paul Manafort's strawberry jacket for $15,000 (with hybris dressed), wrote The Washington Post, and the implications of Stormy Daniels' living descriptions of Trump's anatomy.
At least I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"Everything that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, managing director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars", about the rotating crew of the Trump show and daily surprises (scanning with N.F.L., commendation to Kim Jong-un.)
But if you miss a section, you're off.
When I got Fleiss this week, there were 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and saw MSNBC while he took CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh, who had to be heard in the Senate’s judicial committee, and the future of the Supreme Court had to be decided.
"I remember when we made all these crazy shows before in time, and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Fleiss.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it appears that they were right."

Big sums find the way to the close midway choice of the representatives' house
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of a compensation of two "Congressional Districts" fights two Congress members about the same seat.
This recently relocated district in Pittsburg creates problems for the democratic representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another special choice last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting Congress member, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlapps strongly with the new 17.
The cards were recast, after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court in January sentenced that the old district was legally set up in the Republican’s faveur.
The fight for the new 17th District has launched a fight on economic resources between the Committees of the Great Parties, the Democrats' Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a choice with high watch in March's special elections for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been on the hands of the Republicans for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a little advantage.
The United States considered to punish El Salvador for support for China, but re-determined
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners sworn Trump's management team.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to call back leaders of American diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the foreign ministerial speaker in an announcement earlier in the month.
But it was only El Salvador, who was punished. They received about 140 million dollars of the United States in 2017 for bla.ncotic control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts of financial assistance and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings stepped forward, North and Central American officials shot out a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, which was considered to be a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
In mid-September, however, the top officials made it clear that they would have the conference to take place anyway and thus dropped the considerations of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has to speak to the conference, which is planned at mid-October, to send a signal on the importance of the Americans' meeting, said diplomas.
And the three Americans sent back secretly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard demands or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman of Bolton from the White House did not want to comment on the details of the case described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who would like to talk about the internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analytical who is close to the administration and who also spoke from a condition of anonymity.
Know History
The next obstacle could well be the special accuser Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacle to the investigation, which is significant and publicly available.
Mueller would also refer to the question of whether Trump's campaign was secretly cooperating with Russia on the attack on the elections.
If the Congress was to come on new hands, Trump would probably be put to responsibility while preparing for again meeting the voters and with time, of course, a jury of his colleagues.
There are many insecurities, and I do not claim that Trumps is finally inevitable – and the same applies to his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic we all have to make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to put a state war against Hitler if only the West had been able to resist him by supporting the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and did not take the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbading then.
It is about such turning points that history's axis is turning, and the independible march of democracy is taking on or off.
In the United States, there are now several of these turnover points.
What do we do if Trump firs the man who decides the future of Mueller's investigation, Vice-President Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein's seat has been warm since this newspaper could announce that last year he had proposed to make hidden records of the President and challenge his suitability for the official.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
"How do we react if F.B.I.'s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is terminated or not carried out properly – or if he is approved to the Highest despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false evidence?
And, more importantly, will we vote to the mid-term election for a conference that will hold Trump responsible?
If we fail these trials, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew, who was deported to Auschwitz by the self - associate Nazi regime, who once occupied the homeland of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath on the table with the hawkorf.
How can I be more than optimistic about it in the baggage?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic in front of the fight against SK Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers welcomes the SK Rapid Vienna. After the impressive unaffected result in Spain against Villarreal earlier in the month, they will have good opportunities to move from group G of Europe League with a victory against the Austrians.
A knee damage prevented the midway player Graham Dorrans from getting a seasonal debut before the 2-2 fight against Villarreal, but he believes that Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even larger.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went to the fight with faith that we could get something home, and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but all of this was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half game, but we came out to the second half game and were the best team.
On Thursday, another major European evening is going to be.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they have a good result in the last fight. But with the audience behind us, I am sure that we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been hard because of everything that has happened to my damage and the changes in the club, but the atmosphere is good now.
The team is good, and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can drive on now, put the last season behind us and get success."
Fear of pension saving makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be treated, few were talking to the family about it.
Approximately half of the participants in Nationswide's study reported that they discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent told me they were talking to their children about it.
"Most people want a family member to care for them, but they don't do anything to start the conversation," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nationswide life insurance.
That's how you start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not tell them in good time about your wishes.
Use your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be decisive factors for the cost.
Ask your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you find out how to pay for the costs.
Long-term care can be financed through a traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payment or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have a economy for it.
Get the legal documents arranged: Take the legal battles in the process.
Make a full power so that you can get a trusted person to handle your medical treatment and ensure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes, in case you cannot communicate yourself.
Consider also an economic perfection.
In that case, you designate a trusted person who can make financial decisions and ensure that your accounts are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs urgent medical assistance and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicine and allergy?
Get all these details down on the script, so you're ready.
"It's not just a question of the economy – who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines?
Who cares for the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip to the city.
The victim was in the 40s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, the middle floor and the hand.
Officers describe the shooting that took place at 2:30 p.m., as "voluntary."
The victim didn't see the offender.
His damage is not life-threatening, and the police invite witnesses to stand up.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a violent earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Since the communications routes are out of play, emergency workers have not been able to receive information from the government of Donggala, a northern Palu area, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central-Sulawesian province and is located in the bottom of a narrow bridge on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami hit.
Donggala is a government that extends more than 300 km of the coastline on the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is a administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,900 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basic pillars of the central-Sulavia economy, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel gain is also important in the province, but mainly occurs in Morowali, which is the coast against Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s disaster center, Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was again hit by a tsunami who killed nine.
Indonesia is seismologically located on the so-called breeding in the Pacific and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A violent earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in the northern Sumatra triggered on 26 December a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, including more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and until April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake, measured 6.8, hit the south of Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that went to the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 earthquake hit near the city Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A earthquake, which measured 7.5, hit one of the Mentawai islands from Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A surface earthquake hit Pidie Jaya government in Aceh and spread destruction and panic when the population was reminded of the deathful earthquakes and tsunami in 2004.
A tsunami was not triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin’s eldest son aimed at violence at home
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former governor in Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska was arrested after suspicions of domestic violence, obstacles to the notification of domestic violence and to oppose arrest, according to the report that was sent on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a woman's acquaintance when she tried to report the claimed crime.
Palin is warranted in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a deposit of $500 without security, reports KTUU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "absolutely not guilty," reports the network.
Palin is targeted for three class A violations, which can lead to a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been targeted for a class B violation, which can lead to a penalty on one day in prison and a penalty of $2,000.
It is not the first time that Palin has been targeted for violations of law.
In December 2017 he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently under discussion at Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016 he was aimed at violence in the home, to prevent the notification of a violent crime in the home and the possession of weapons in the affected state of the event.
His boyfriend accused him of giving her a hit in her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after explaining his son's violent behaviour with PTSD as a result of his posting in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia: several hundreds died
At least 384 people have died after a earthquake on Friday hit the Indonesian island Sulawesi.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes.
The area is without electricity and communication paths, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit right south of the central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On the social media, there are videos that show the moment when the earthquake rammes.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu, when the tsunami went to the coast.
Public prosecutors try to get terror attacked in NYC sentenced rare death penalty
Public prosecutors are trying to get the death penalty of Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York City, who killed eight people – a rare punishment which was last sentenced for a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, the 30-year-old Saipov reportedly used a rental car from the construction market Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where footgathers and cyclists who came in the way were meat down.
As a basis for the death penalty, the chargers must prove that Saipov "considerably" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, which is required by the Declaration of Intention of Death Criminal in the Southern District of New York.
According to the legal document, death penalty is a possible result of both these objectives.
A number of weeks after the attack, a government jury could present Saipov for an appeal of 22 points, including eight accusations of the murder of gangsters, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and an accusation of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "abundant planning and preparations", the accusations said and described Saipov's execution as "indispensable, wicked and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused human injury, body damage and loss for families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the Declaration of Intentions states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It was a decade ago that the southern district of New York last called up in a case of death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder of two suppliers of drugs, but ended with lifelong imprisonment in September 2009.
The death sentence was last sentenced in a state case in New York in 1953, and then the couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced for spying on behalf of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
The Rosenberg pair was executed in the electric chair on 19 June, 1953.
Saipov came from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, no signs of repentance in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said to the researchers that he was fine with his works.
According to the accusation, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag on his hospital room, told the cops.
He has rejected himself guilty of the 22 points of the charge.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, announced that they were "of course disappointed" by the accusers' decision.
"We believe that the decision to follow the death penalty and not accept a confession and lifelong prison penalty without the possibility of release will only extend the trauma for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov’s defenders had earlier asked the accusers not to go after death penalty.
Conservative Minister believes that NIGEL FARAGE should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader stated that politicians had to be able to ‘mark the pressure’ from the eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May's own ministers had said that Farage should take over the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative Member of the European Parliament, Peter Bone, said to the demonstration in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "was out now" if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May's challenge to create a collection of the deeply divided party is stressed by the fact that conservative remainers participate in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on the track under attacks from both brexites, remainers and the European Union.
Her allies insist that in spite of the relapse, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – thereby force the eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or "chaos".
For the demonstration Leave Means Leave in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scratch the Chequers plan.
He explained that Farage should have been included and given him the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would have been out now," he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to scrap Chequers."
On the background of his EU opposition, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subject to anyone's submission.
We will determine our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected that the opinion of the public should have changed since the vote in 2016: "The fact that the British people should have changed their minds and want to stay in the European Union is totally wrong."
The Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also went to the demonstration and told the journalists: "I just say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chequers plan is unopular in the wide population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and get us in.
Now let Chequers go, and start listening to.'
As a tip comment to May, she added: "Premier ministers keep their job when they hold their promises."
Farage told the record that politicians should be able to "mark the press" if they fail the decision from the vote in 2016.
"Now it's a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They're gonna betray Brexit, but we're gathered to tell them that we don't let them go."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "You must make sure that the political class, which is on the knife to betray Brexit, can feel the pressure.
"We mobilise the people's army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we won't stop until we have become an independent, self-controlled and proud UK."
In the meantime, remains marched through Birmingham before a twenty-hour's inclusion in the city center.
Spread aktivists floated with Conservative Mod Brexit banners after the formation of the group this weekend.
The Labour College Lord Adonis used to laugh with the security problems with the conservatives' party app before the meeting.
"They are the people who claim that they have control over the IT systems and technology for Canada, to border controls, to free trade without borders in Ireland," he said.
"It's totally a laugh.
There's nothing called a good Brexit," he added.
Warren "thinks strongly" to make up the presidential elections
Member of the House of Representatives Senator Elizabeth Warren "is considering strongly to set up the presidential election" after the midway election in November.
According to Boston Globe, the Democrat of Massachusetts talked about his future at a city council meeting on Saturday in the western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, will try to re-elect the State Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016 in November.
You have wondered if she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with the voters at the council since Trump took over the office.
A participant asked her if she planned to make up the presidential elections.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington and repair our political system, and it requires a woman in front.
Arrest in case of shooting on LSU's Sims
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested on Friday for the shooting of Wayde Sims, the basketball player from the LSU.
The police in Baton Rouge announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested on Friday for a ET news meeting at 11.00 p.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help to identify a man on the recordings.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was hit by shots in the head and died of the damage," said police leader Murphy J. Paul according to the media 247 sports.
Wayde attacked to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to have been present in possession of a weapon and to have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without problems and is now in the police in the East Baton Rouge District Warning.
Sims was a two metres high three-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. In the last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played 17,4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russia's grand prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to the World Championship, after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualifyed before Lewis Hamilton Saturday that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a decisive role in the race.
From the leadership, Bottas got a good start and was close to slowing Hamilton completely when he defended his position in the first two swings and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel ran in pit as the first, and Hamilton allowed to fight with the traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes car went in pit a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front, when the Ferrari driver had to leave the interior by a double defense at the third swing after any wheel contact.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round on his 21-year birthday.
Then he led in a large part of the race, as in a attempt to a fast end, he failed to change tyre to take Kimi Raikkonen’s fourth place.
He had to pit on the 44th round, but could not increase the rate of the last eight rounds, why the Raikkon guaranteed the fourth place.
"It's a hard day because Valtteri did it amazing all weekend and really was a gentleman when he let me pass.
The team made an incredible piece of work to ensure both the first and the second place," said Hamilton.
Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump reproached Senator Dianne Feinstein at a electoral meeting on Saturday because she insisted that she had not delighted the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
At a electoral meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention the testimony that Ford had given before the US Senate's court committee, but said that the events in the Senate showed that people were "guilty and dishonest and dishonest".
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful things that have happened the last few days in the Senate when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and evil and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at statements and delicious, then they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you like it?
Remember her answer... was it you who swallowed the document -- "Oh, uh, what?
No, no.
I didn't like anything."
Hey, wait a minute.
If we've been delicious... no, we haven't delicious anything," he added in a rehearsal of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter on Ford's charges against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was delicious earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the delicate came from her office.
"I haven't hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, and I haven't delighted her story," said Feinstein to the comee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I've done that."
But her denial was not well received by the President who said at Saturday's electoral meeting: "I tell you that it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."
During the president's continued defense of the nominated judge to the Supreme Court, which has been accused of three women's sexual abuse, Trump suggested that the Democrats used the accusations to benefit their own case.
"They don't shoot any means in their efforts to take power back.
You can see the wickedness, the oppositions, they don't care about who they're supposed to tromle to get power and control," said the president according to the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants mod Dundee
Dundee Stars did it again after Friday's lost Elite League fight against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 back fight in Dundee on Saturday.
Giants quickly came in front with two targets with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie justified on home course before Dwyer brought Giants back in front.
Francois Bouchard compensated for Dundee before Luke Lundvald Nielsen guaranteed the victory with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat for Adam Keefe's team, who came back to fight Dundee 2-1 in the Friday fight in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, where Giants went out as victories in the previous three matches.
Dwyer put out for the fourth minute of 3:35 from a assistant from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as a assistant when Beauvillier doubled the leader four minutes later.
In a busy leading period, Sullivan brought back the home team at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt stood behind Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that Giants came in front at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard realigned with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen bring Dundee in front for the first time in the battle late in the second period, and he guaranteed the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the last period.
Giants, who has now lost four of their five matches, is at home in Milton Keynes for their next fight on Friday.
Flight leader died to ensure that hundreds of flight passengers avoided earthquakes
A flight leader in Indonesia was commended as a whole after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers came safely down to the ground.
More than 800 people are dead and many are missing after a larger earthquake in the Fridays hit the Sulawesi Island and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy nails still destroy the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agungs colleagues fled for life, he refused to leave his place in the swearing control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed back in his place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who held on the start track, came safely in the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was going to collapse.
He died in the hospital later.
Chairman of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, according to the Australian ABC News, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
"We're crushed," he added.
The authorities fear that the death rate can reach thousands of people, and the country's catastrophic emergency announces that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death figure is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," said the spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to six metres of high waves have destroyed Palu, who keeps a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly emergency aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, said to Sky News: "Every minute a new ambulance comes with more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
All the shops are plundered."
Jan Gelfand, head of International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're coming to.
It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work around the day to carry out all the tasks of evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombrok earlier in the year when more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini is now saying that a man is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the Lagune in the Pacific, Micronesia, now says that a man is missing, even though one had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members were evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini claims that Saturday afternoon it could not find a male passenger.
The airline announced that it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned to requests for further information on the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local both helped save the other passengers and the crew, after the flight hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officers said Friday that seven people had been driven to the hospital.
The airline claims that six passengers were in the hospital for Saturday and that they were all in stable state.
It is still not clear what caused the collapse and the exact order of the events.
The airline and the U.S. marine are both saying that the plane landed in the lagoon before the landing track.
Some witnesses thought that the plane fled by the landing track.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers could go into water to life to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the crew was in panic and cried, and that he had had a smaller head damage.
The U.S. marine said that sailors who worked to clean up a cage nearby also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to freak people in the country before the plane dropped at about 30 metres of the depth.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG registered airlines over the last two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analytics determine the timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his proof on Saturday during the Anchor case of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analytics at the US Ministry of Justice, Paul Rowlett, made witness statements for several hours as expert witnesses in data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used telescope information to compile the past of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from several different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claims, writes The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' mobile phone at the time he had claimed he and his friend Michael Sanford visited the police Sanford.
Sanford sat in the testimony on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the accuser asked if Tellis spoke the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that evening, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at one time after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He removed her from his life," said Hale.
The defence is planned to start its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the jury to vote later the same day.
The High Breed: What is political hiphop?
A hiphoptrio would like to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that hiphop has moved away from its origin with political messages and social problems.
They will return to the starting point and make political hiphop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently received a revival in Britain because of artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
Children's girl in New York is prosecuting couples after firing with "racist" texts
A childfriend in New York claims a couple for discriminating firing after being sent a text message on a mistake from the mother who complained that she was "now a black person".
The couple denied that they were racists, but compared the case with "expression".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is the mother of two, expressed his terror to find out that the new child girl, Giselle Maurice, was black when she met on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEY, NOT ENDNU AND SORT PERSON," wrote Plasco-Flaxman to his husband in a text.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, it fired Plasco-Flaxman Giselle Maurice and said that their former childfriend, as from Africa-American, had been bad to her work, and that instead she expected a Philippine, according to New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one day work and sent home to an Uber.
Now Giselle Maurice is prosecuting the couple to get compensation for the firing and compensation for 350 dollars a day in the six months when she should have lived with the family, although this was agreed without a contract.
"I would like to show them that you cannot allow yourself to do something like this," she said to the newspaper on Friday and added, "I know it is discrimination."
The couple has defended themselves with the fact that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not trust her after being offended.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco to The Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone you had been unnecessary to, even though it had happened by a mistake?
Your baby?
Honestly."
Plasco compared the case with "expression" and that his wife had born two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Are you really going after someone like that?
This is not particularly kindly done," added the investment consultant.
Even though the case is still in progress, the Court of First Instance has already described the couple on social media and has shamed their behavior and logic.
New letter reveals that Paddington publisher feared that readers couldn't relate to a speaking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said about the letter: "It is difficult to imagine being the one who reads it for the first time before it was published.
It's pretty funny to read now when you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman at BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small clothing bomb, would have been optimistic, even though his history was rejected, and that the 60th year of the publication of the books was "bitterly" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father was proud of her success in all modestness.
"He was a silent man, and he didn't like pride," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt as if you had a child who achieved something: You are proud of them, although it isn't really your profit.
I think he saw Paddington's popularity in that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say that it was Paddington's fault."
Say goodbye to dying daughter over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was driven to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors in vain tried to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad and that she probably didn't survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that she would die within the next few minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon again.
See you later.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart in motion slowly lost their effect.
She was dead shortly before, and now she closed the body.
I just had to sit there and wait for it happened.
I couldn't cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to take me together."
Finally, the mourning Ednan-Laperouse went on board on the plane with the other passengers who didn't know what she was going through.
"Nobody knew it," she said.
"I buried my head, and the tears continued to run.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Injuring Women Try to Stop Suicide Shoppers
Two women who have lost suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set a map on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old when he had a depression, and 18 when he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parent to experience the grief I experience every day," she said.
45-year-old Sharon Davis said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
"His smile was known by everyone.
People said that his smile lighted the room up."
But he stopped working before he died because he was really bad.
In 2014 Tyler's 11-year-old brother found him when he had taken his life.
Sharon Davis said, "I'm always afraid if it's spreading."
Sharon Davis made the cards to "Tell people that there's someone out there you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don't go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to anyone."
Sharon Davis's long-year-old friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her girlfriend for 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say anything about that he was sorry or depressed or something," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, he began to change.
He was really very down Christmas. When the children opened their gifts, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: "It has created a hole in our family.
It has cut us apart.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear while the FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited time-limited study – we might get a little consensus," said Flake on Saturday and added that he feared that the come "falled from the hind" in the middle of the locked part of the situation.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporter have the FBI conducted their investigation?
Their restraint is due to the time.
The midway elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November, and if the Republicans, as expected, are doing bad, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they would like to have chosen to the highest judgement of the country.
George W. Bush has called Senators to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI finishes his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the decisive vote and choose him to the Supreme Court.
The number of Nordkorean 'faller' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean heads to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawgiver.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korea Association Ministry and said that there were 1.127 heads last year compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers were involved in the changed numbers.
Pyongyang has not given any official comments.
In the meantime, the majority of heads from North Korea are offered citizenship in South Korea.
South Korea's government claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korea War ended in 1953.
Most fleeing through China, which has the longest border approaching to North Korea, which is easier to cross than the difficultly guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the hops to be illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they often become forced homes.
The relationship between North and South Korea - which is technically still in war - has been significantly improved over the last few months.
Previously on the month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met to talk about the striking negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happens after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work against a nuclear-free Korea at a general level.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed American sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and in such circumstances it is excluded that we are going to disarm ourselves," said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and says he's inappropriate to the Supreme Court.
President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, for "hysterical" and said that his temperament was not suited to the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comment came in a interview on Saturday to Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't stop thinking that if a woman had acted in this way, it would have called her hysterical," said Pelosi about his reaction to Kavanaugh's witness statement before the Senate's judicial committee in Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected emotionally the accusations that he had committed a sexual offense against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he spoke of his family and his years in high school, he almost cried and was crying.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "great and coordinated character mode" arranged by the left-wing, angry, that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidential post in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's statement proved that he could not be in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was predecessor to the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi was abroad when she was asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh to a Kingdom court if he was confirmed and if the Democrats were given a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say that if he does not speak the truth to the Congress or the FBI, he is not suited to sit in the Highest, but certainly also in the court he is in now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently sitting in the court of appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions in relation to Obama's health reform or abortion case Roe v. Wade, because he is considered to be a conservative judge.
During the consultations, Kavanaugh did not answer whether he would revise certain former Supreme Court decisions.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, predecessed person must contest a job as judge and expect us to say "yemen, it's not just beautiful," said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, several months and years of anger, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal, do you think?"
She continued: "I got great support from a woman who was the boss who said that she was also crying when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began to cry, she would say to the woman she spoke to: "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories is from one of my first jobs in a office with overweight of men, where I often cried out of anger, where I was taken at the neck of an older woman – a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out on the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry, and they'll accept that they're gonna hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a member of the Congress of the Democrats of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed in having an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and pulling up as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and found that she could stand up as well as a President candidate.
"It wasn't a special reasoned decision," she said laughing to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the process, and they certainly did not need another candidate.
Some called it "Snew white and the seven dwarfs."
Because it was late in the election campaign, she was back with fundraising, so she promised she would not participate unless she collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech that she wouldn't stop, she was overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to travel money and reach out to voters instead of electorate, and anger over sexism – that she got a clump in her neck.
"You could believe that I had a nervous consumption," Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You were supposed to think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking what you're going to write on my tomb stone?
"She cried?"
In this way, the trade war between the United States and China can be a advantage for Beijing
The opening salves in the trade war between the United States and China were sound, and even though the battle is far from over, division between the countries can be a long-term advantage for Beijing, says experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by placing duties on important Chinese export products, such as solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The largest escalation this week with new customs duties affecting goods for a value of $200 billion applies in principle to half of all products imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has reimbursed each time, at the latest by adding taxes of 5-10 % on US products for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world's second largest economy probably does not give after the same provision.
If it causes Washington to withdraw its demands, it means that they give up, but for China's president, Xi Jinping, it will be too embarrassing to bear down to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, American pressures in the trade war can have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
"A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create roughly for a economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it is actually far more dangerous than you thought," said Abigail Grace, researcher with focus on Asia at the New American Security Tank Center.
Syria is 'clear' to receive refugees, believes the Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready for the refugees to return and ask for help to build the country that has been destroyed by the more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was in progress.
"Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to control the territories destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore a normal state.
All conditions are now present in order that refugees can return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily life and bread.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million oxygens have escaped from the country since 2011 when the war began.
Further six million people still in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that were involved in supporting the rebellion.
Europe ensures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 and hit the American team 16.5 - 10,5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points it required to strike the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had it hard in most of the tournament, shot his drive in the lake at pair 3 on 16 holes, which made him lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari did well in all rounds and became 1 out of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, where the current format of the tournament started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 of the lowest ranged European player, Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
No. 1 on the world ranklist, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in the baggage, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the most winning Europeans with 25.5 career points.
"I normally don't cry, but today I can't do it.
It's been a hard year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm really happy to get the trophy back.
This is a team effort, and I am pleased that I could help," said a emotionate Garcia after the European victory.
He sends the plot to his countryman John Ram, who fell the American golf-learning Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match Sunday.
"I'm incredible proud of having hit Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It is a joke statistics for one of the best golf players ever who have won 14 big titles, only overrun by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had all weekend problems finding the form except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team's disappointing show: "I am proud of the guys, because they fought for the matter.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe opposition.
We lost.
The hat of Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really good.
We will regroup, and I will cooperate with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we will continue.
I love the 12 guys, and I'm proud of being their captain.
You have to lighten the hat.
We were defeated."
