Cried to the World
The Marketing Strategy Looks Like You Need Iceland seems to have gone well and crying and calling out in nature is about to take people around the world.
“You have the collage, I need Iceland,” says a woman outside the big world in comments on the advertising of the Looks Like You Need Island market campaign on YouTube.
Another audience will keep Iceland in her heart forever, and a young woman says that it is essential to get as first to Iceland’s end as her fiancée dwells there.
To the unhappy, however, she is in the United States and expects to wait for a few months.
Another spectator asks whether the road to Iceland is capable, because there are no planes.
Doesn't follow the story if it comes from a second time belt.
Egil Thordarson at the Peel Advertisement Office, who arrived in the formation of the advertisements with the M&C Saatchi International Advertisement Office, said that the receptions have been further hoped.
“I came to many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign has already started to hit.
In the base, this is about creating PR-values, that is to get foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it has gone incrediblely well.
In a relatively short time, we have received a discussion of some seven hundred media worldwide, reaching a total of two billion people.
The cost of the discussion is worth $1.8 billion.
It's not funny."
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, although the Americans are not on the way to the country.
According to Egils, a market area, such as Denmark, the UK, and Germany, has also accepted well, such as Russia, which is a pleasant surprise.
Then there were reactions from foreign areas, such as India, which were not specifically involved.
“ These advertisements have traveled farther than we expected, ” says Eric, but it may be that more than four million people have looked at YouTube’s material.
“We couldn’t have desired a better beginning.”
The pictures here at the opening took the year of Saeberg, the photographer of the Morning Magazine, and took an advertisement with the title "Let It Out" in the middle of the last month.
The roofs went wide and wide, such as at the school guards in Reykjavík, in the mountains of Reynis, at the foot of the forest, in the sunshine, and in the cave of the heads of the heart.
The managers were Samuel Bjarki the son of Peter, and Gunnar Paul, the son of Olaf, at the shot of production, and the captain of the son of God.
In their roles, the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas were from Cuba and Hungary.
Twenty Isleans arrived in the formation of the advertisements, but at the same time as recordings took place in the South were another group in the West and the West Fjords.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but it is aimed at a winter campaign in cooperation with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for Iceland’s office,” says Eric, adding that cooperation with M&C Saatchi has been extremely successful.
“ It’s great to work with them.
In such tasks, it is important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking to."
Explosive spirit: Talk the status of the labour market, life-eye, and many more
Mr. Einar Dadason's social and child-tal minister, meets in the explosive sand that starts at 10 o'clock today.

He also discusses rural areas and transfers to a country that has gone badly and has been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, President VR, is also involved, but he will discuss his criticism about the investments of life-eye funds and present ideas that the movement of workers and employers will withdraw from the governments of the funds to reduce the risk of interests.
Then they will be discussed with Ivar, the son of Ingimar, a traveler in Austria, and the daughter of Johann, the executive of the North Market Centre, on the location of travel service in the countryside.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder whether the success of the summer is a miserable command for what to come.
You can listen to the section below, but it starts at ten o’clock.
That's how she looks today 25 years later
The playwoman Elisa Donovan had a successful course in all kinds of youths.
However, she was worldly producing her game as Amber in Clive’s movie 25 years ago.
She also played in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch and Melissu Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49, married to one child.
It has been a little bit past, but it was made to look over the way and communicate Claudes on a loving television in the days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy, who died unexpected in 2009 and says she was a great person.
“ I have to admit that I was mostly based on girls I met at school that were not good to me.
As soon as I read the handwriting, I knew who this person was," said Donovan about her game in Cluess.
Didn't want to leave the police station after nightrest
Today, about fifty cases came to the police board in the capital area, saying in the police journal that things were varied.
The day at the Omfisgate Police Station began by the need for police to have interfered with a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there due to an autopsy.
The man didn't want to leave after he was released, and he didn't obey the police orders that told him to leave.
The man earned a continuing stay at the police station because of his progress.
Then a man was arrested in the morning year suspected of breaking into a company in Copawagi.
Police also had to interact with two men in Breithole due to reports of physical attack.
Then, too, a woman sitting in a shop center in Copenhagen could not pay for the account after the meal, so he was called to the police.
It was also reported that the car was stolen in the middle of the city this morning.
The driver of the white Renault warrant looked out of her for a moment and was then taken an unfruitful hand.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Merry Force - The Terrible Destiny of the Glass Stars
The doctrine has reached a flight on the Internet that curse is over the series of Gladness teams, while the playwriting Naya Rivera drunk in California in the days and thus became the third major player of the factors to live long ago.
The articles of the joy - team (e.g. Glee) are a popular series of songs, dances, and joy.
The classes covered the so - called joyful throne of youths at school, their love, and their destiny.
It was not always taken out with the happiness of being in the joyal team, but through singing and dance, individuals seemed to overcome any situation in their lives.
But outside the place of arrest, great distress has been overwhelming the players and the staff of the factors, so much that the teachings have awakened that a curse is on the elements.
Naya Marie Rivera took the role of Santana Lopez in the components, a lap manager who did not call all her grandmother.
After the run, Rivera began to have the player Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and then divorced them.
Dorsey, however, refused to submit a dear speech and was deprived of domestic violence.
On July 8, the last year, Riveru was missed after her four - year - old son found alone on a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy felt sleeping in a rescue west on board the boat and could report the police authorities that he and his mother had swimed, and then Rivera would have brought him back to the boat but never returned to it itself.
A great search for Rivera.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area reported that we had been looking out from the day Rivera had been drunk.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially executed.
It is estimated that she had a huge stream of water and a new need to save the son.
Death cause was recorded as a result of accidental accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took the role of Finn Hudson in the factors, the American footballman with the angel voice, who played a key role in bringing the Gladness team to praise and respect.
But without the factors, Moneith struggled with personal devils.
Since his 13 - year - old age, he had struggled with addiction and proved difficult to escape it.
In 2013, his companions found enough to be involved, caught in, and urged him to seek help.
Moneith then began treatment, and it seemed that everything looked better.
Only two months after the end of the treatment, Moneith felt dead in a hotel room after having started entertaining with friends.
Banamein proved a fatal mix of vitamins and alcohol.
It was not considered to be a willingness.
Moneith had been treated, and his tolerance before vitamin administration had decreased so much that the dose he had previously been well tolerated proved fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his fellow workers, but that his counterpart, Lea Michele, was determined to continue taking the factors and sanctify them a whole part of the memorial of Moneith and his person of Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the parts, Puck was an American footballman, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellows in the Gladness team, or all until he became bold to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles, suspected of the protection of child cramps.
In his home search, he found a huge amount of child clam, and the matter was soon publicly questioned.
Clearly, Salling had been.
Afterward, he was accused and convicted for his breach.
He had the heads of four to seven years of prison, in addition to what he would need to be recorded by sexual transgressors and seek treatment for childish desire.
Before the Judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who was then free from guarantee, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just the actors who fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant manager of the factors.
He became asleep in 2013, only 41 years old.
A woman named Nancy Motes also worked at the sections.
She was the younger sister of Juliu Robert’s great star, and she did not carry her sister’s beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great government and disrespectful conduct.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she suffered from severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancée, saying to her mother and sisters that she was responsible for what happened to her.
“ My mother and my so - called siblings will have nothing after me except the memory that they were the ones that caused my worst depression. ”
Lea Michel was the star of the factors.
She has recently been accused of using her fellowships’ seal and passion at the location and having an overwhelming stray of stars.
In 2012, Jesse Luken participated in the factors.
He was arrested and accused of a ravage in 2019, which felt a great distress.
Heather Morris played a great role in the factors.
In 2010, she became aware of the fact that unwrought computers came into naked pictures of her and published on the Internet.
The players Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner played both in the fields and had a love relationship outside.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had committed violence in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
It increases children’s maturity when they play out with their parents to cultivate flowers and to watch them grow and flourish.
It is also possible forever to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel pointes out.
Just having a time with the children in the park is something that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the smell, and, of course, the precious time they received with their parents.
Buying a boat after the tenth class
“I don’t think we’re a lot of mariners working in the country’s schools,” says Axel Örn Gottmundsson, who is fishing the beach in the summer but who learns psychology at the University of Iceland over winter.”
Beach fishing is a very pleasant summer work when you are studying.
If it is good to fish, you can have a good income, and I find it great to get rid of it.
The revenues are also good for me in the winter," says Axel Örn Godmund Son, a 25-year-old psychologist, who is fishing for the summer, like the last summer.
Axel was the newest to bridge on the Talkfire when a reporter reached from him late to the beginning of the week."
“ The wine I was in the tenth class, I took the right of shipownership for boats under twelve metres long, and I bought my boat the summer after finishing the basic school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summers since.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, the man of the son of Jonah, and I made the boat name his name.
When I bought the boat, Hartmann had grown up, and he was very happy when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“ I made a deal with Hartmann about paying half a half million at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I had been hunting.
So I had the boat indebted at the end of my first summer on it."
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay for a boat when he had just completed a primary school?
“ When I was a boy, I was all hunting with him and got my share, I had been working with my dad to sea.
I also put my vessels in my vessel."
Axel is born on Isaac, from which all his natives are; but he has lived in Copah since he was a boy.
“ I can fish here in the western area because I have a law home at my grandmother on Isafire.
I learned in this area in the west of my father's roots.
I go between the distance, according to the way I feel, for this fishing area is closer to all the West.
Although I feel the best to be in the west, I have also provided around the snowfall and around the south.
I have also provided for the south, but then preferably a galoppy," says Axel, who always runs one firepiece in the morning, saying sometimes speaking to the mosquitoes and singing for the sky, in the lonely hours out on the cupboard.
“ The network on the sea is good, so I can call, listen to downloads and music.
I don't think it's a problem to be alone on the boat.
Of course I'm trying to avoid landing in throat, but surely something has been sometime weathering, but never a lot of danger," says Axel, who's lucky that he's never seafood.
He says that the length of the working day depends on how the fishing is going each time.
“ I’m never more than 14 hours on fishing at once, but I’ve also been hunting in other systems, for example, in the cab, but I’ve been kept on fishing for one and a half day on the sea. ”
He says that he can fish 770 pounds a day that he feels hampered.
“ Other limits are that I may not hunt Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, and I may only catch twelve days a month, these four months of coastal fishing, in May, June, July, and August.
In my opinion, mariners should choose their fishing days by weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is to calm down instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and to choose by their head.
So the area exchangers may also go for me, and a water lock that is well positioned at the fishing site should enjoy it," says Axel, who drains most of the dryness from the salt sea on its coastal fishing, but also only the oaks and exceptional other species floods.
Axel works over winter with the college at the Nupi Academy in Kopawagi.
“ I don’t think we’re many mariners working in the country’s schools, ” says Axel proudly, adding that he was only intended to work temporarily at the school.
“ I was stuck there because I feel this great job.
I hope that the psychology study will take advantage of me at the stage in the future," says Axel, who is also far away with business studies.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
An error in a recording magazine that people filled in when they arrived in the country led to a person who lived in this country was not called back to show.
There is no condition to register the number if the person fills the magazine in English, as it is when it is done in English.
“ This will be examined in the week, ” says a specialist in a farmer’s health care area.
Three inland squads were diagnosed at the National Hospital Virus Department yesterday.
On July 15, one of those who proved to be positive came to the country, two days after the application of the so - called residency rules.
The residents in Iceland are then tailored to the land and again preached in the four - to - five - day show.
However, in the afternoon news of RUV, the person had taken care of the old system.
The display at the borders was negative, and it was not called back in a scenario for the virus.
Camilla Ruth Sigfus daughter, a farmer’s diagnostic specialist, tells a newspaper that this may cause an error in the electronic recording magazine.
If people fill out the registration magazine in English, it is not the condition to insert the identical number in the English version.
At the end, it was primarily thought for foreign travelers.
Therefore, the person has not received an automatic invitation to show.
However, Kamilla says that many have followed rules on home - to - date, although they have filled the form of registration in English and in some cases, employers have also been alert to send people back to show after they arrived in the country.
“ This will be examined over the week how it is possible to facilitate access to people to this to raise their attention to the course. ”
The man is isolated, and six have been put into a disease.
All of them go to show, but two of them began to show signs.
The three infections that were diagnosed last night are now being smoked, mostly due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the series analysis of Irish genotype analysis has shown that there are variations of the crown virus that have not been found before.
In the second case, Israel has been directed, although it was known that the one who carried the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Camilla says that there should be tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
All are now 15 in isolation according to the CVID web site.
135 are in a disease.
Four out of five infections unconnected
Five inland smits have been diagnosed in the last few days.
Of these four alphas are unlinked and have not been found to produce the origin of the infection that occurred at the Rey Cup sports convention yesterday.
There's still a shaking.
Originally, in a thirty - year - old, they were specially sent to a disease, which was reduced to sixteen.
Overall, 34 are pathogenic because of these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that is diagnosed by an infected sports event, and it has raised questions about whether such events should be held.
John K. Johannsson, the public security director of the dictatorship, says it very slowly, as long as people comply with rules and regulations.
“ We are constantly busy for all those living here who need to maintain individual infectious agents.
We also need to focus on people who are holding events that there are certain rules that need to be applied.
Then it is possible to hold an event," says John.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by keeping individual infectious agents in the air.
In addition, the rules and standards are in a continuous review.
“ What needs to be done, and what is constantly needed by the public protection department and by the medical authority for people, is in mind these individual infectious agents.
Both home and service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
It prevents infection from continuing," says John.
“ We need to urge people to continue on the good road we were on, in order to maintain the success we have made here for grace. ”
40% of the CVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard how hard her father was to breathe.
Her father had diabetes, so she urged him to seek medical assistance.
The next day, he was dead.
The mortality was caused by sudden respiratory difficulties due to crown virus infections.
Diabetes have been identified as the underlying problem of the death witness, and Brumfield, also with diabetes, is deadly afraid that the same thing will happen.
Reuter's newspaper says "Brumfield" isn't reasonless.
Numbers of new studies conducted by the U.S. authorities show that nearly 40% of those who were killed with diabetes 2 were underlying disease.
When the proportion of those who had not reached 65 years of age is examined, the proportion increases to half.
The study of the U.S. Disease Surveillance Monitor (CDC) included more than 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the crown virus during the February and May period.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious specialist in CDC, says that the results are defective, especially for those who have diagnosed diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Reuter’s slow growth was hidden and pointed out the answers from the 12 countries responding to comparable proportions.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, and Colombia, have not yet been distinguished from underlying diseases.
“ Diabetes had already a slow growth epidemic.
Now, COVID-19 has been violated as a powerful age," Reuters of Elbert Huang, Chief Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at Chicago University.
Diabetes are more common among black and South American people, which have also been worse from the crown virus.
One of the best precautions for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease under control with physical exercise, loyal diets, and healthcare professionals.
However, the crown virus epidemic has made it difficult for many to keep a ruin.
In that case, a high amount of insulin has taken some to continue working and discontinue exposure to the virus.
Reuters suggests that the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risks that those with diabetes 2 may be caused by the virus.
When the SARS crown virus passed in 2003, more than 20% of them suffered from the disease, and in the 2009 swine fever, this group had a three times greater risk of hospitalization.
When MERS experienced this in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were implanted in complete care were diabetic.
Charles S. Dela Cruz researcher at Yale University says that because the effect of the COVID-19 virus may have been longer then the epidemic has seen the cover of a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’ll see a flood wave of problems when this is over,” says president Andrew Bolton of the International Association of Sugar Disorders.
Physicians have warned that the crown virus epidemic could instantly lead to an increase in complications associated with diabetes, including kidney diseases and renal diabetic diabesis.
Similarly, new studies indicate that the crown virus may lead to an increase in diabetic events.
Reuters says that scientists are trying to understand the relationship between the crown virus and diabetes 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lung and kidneys, which are already ill in many diabetic patients.
Then high glucose and lipid rates in diabetic patients may cause a true “cell message storm,” as it is called when the immune system is overreacting and attacking the body.
Treatmental intravenous cells can also lead to inflammation which can cause fatal blood clots again.
“ This is all one big puzzle game,” says Dela Cruz.
“This is related to all infringements.”
The news has been corrected.
"We were invited champagne, then they left the room."
The Astran Magnus daughter and Atli Bollason received the extraordinary request from the artist Ragnar Kjartans son of art to pursue sex in front of a camera for the work that the artist was setting up in Paris.
“ We loved each other so that it was not complicated. ”
So, atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and grandmother, Asruna Magnus daughter, for the first time.
“ I was very pleased with her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but so it also loved me quite adorable.
And still thanks," he says.
This also remembers the end of the husband’s first meeting regularly.
“ I’m always hearing this story.
Last only about the weekend," she says, who was also attracted to the husband at the first time.
“ I felt and feel so excited around Atla, which I feel like.
There's a lot going on and a lot to happen and I've been happy with it."
Atli says that their husband and wife have stressed their own ways.
“ We don’t bind our baggage the same knobs as our companions.
We're avoiding routes that we're exploring around."
There is a possible reason why they took the evangelizer from the son of Ragnar Kjartan only joyfully, though it was not unusual.
“Christine Anna, our common friend, has contacted us and asks if we can come to eat desert with her, Ragga and the Ingibjörg wife of Ragnar, on Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, and met the three oak of Snaps, and got the desert wine and their afterhand.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through their plans for an artistic show, which he was thinking to set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris, in the fall of Paris.
“ He had a multitude of knowledge that was called Scenes from Western culture.
He explained it in a simple way."
Ashron says that he described the work as a deadly and decadent from the life of the Western people.
“ He had skiss of all the senses he wanted to shoot, and at last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part in. ”
Senan as Ragnar asked the couple to participate in showing young intersection couples to love in a minimal room.
“ These are with the beginning and the end, ” says Atli.
Although Ragnar knew about him and of them, the couple did not know much, “but they knew us and felt that they would fit in this.
They had a word that they did not want to advertise for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people, but people who had sexual education from performing for others."
They greeted Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take a long time.
“ When we ran out of Snaps, we said, ‘ Are we not just in this?
It was just like that.
I trusted Ragnari as an artist and all his team," says Asrún and Atli are taking part.
"This is about love and closeness"
Senan was taken up in a fine apartment at the Myrgate.
There was a very lowly film album; a recorder, Ragnar, and a musician, and the pair.
After the recording had been turned on, all left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásrún.
“ We hadn’t decided what we should be.
We received some little instructions, but we tried to forget a moment and a place.
To be unconscious of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn't a game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," said Ásrún.
But was that romantic?
“ Yes, it was a little romantic, ” says Atli and Asrún.
“ We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like having a vacation on a fine hotel in Paris."
The team was satisfied with the pair’s performance in the work that moved them.
“When Tommi was watching this, he cried, he liked it so beautiful,” says Atli.
“ This is as much about love as about closeness as about the relationship itself, ” says Ásrún.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tells Atli that his mother heard the voice of the son in the Cathedral of Reykjavik and then realized that he was part of the work.
“ Then she turns around and begins to pee into this, ” says Atli.
“ Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anybody this way, but then my dad just sent me a message and said, "Good to hit the little family in Palais de Tokyo," rebels Ásrun.
And would the participation in the work have deepened the relationship between Asrún and Atla?
“ At least we are still together, so maybe this was something deeper.
This at least deepened my relationship with my family's family," says Ásrún and laughs.
Assrún himself saw the work in a Caupmannahöf with his colleague.
“ I felt a little difficult not to be with you, but to someone else, ” she says and turns to the husband.
“ But it was nice to see this because this is just one second in a much larger work, and when you saw this with the other works, this is very nice.
I was just proud.
And there was the little bone in my stomach," said Ashran, who was pregnant by the other child of the wives when the sene was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausen talked to the Asruna and Atla in love stories on Reason 1.

Five years from 2009 without a missionary
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. messenger in Iceland, is in the light of the media after CBS reported this morning that he wanted a armed lifeguard, fearing his life.
However, it has not been hardly for the president of the United States to order a ambassador in this country.
Since Carol Van Vorst was dismissed by the Office of the U.S. Ambassadors in April 2009, the country has totally been unavailable for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Forst left his office under special circumstances, but Kastlicht reported in 2009 that she should have received the Falk Ordinance.
On the way to a greeting meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a call from the presidential office that she would not be honored.
After she left Iceland, she taught international communication with the Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until the successor of Van Forst came to work in September 2010.
In some way, Robert S. Connan was appointed as a messenger but then stopped.
At the end of the work, Loius Ariega had served in the foreign ministry for decades.
In the afternoon of 2013, he took the office of ambassadors in Guatemala.
Then another time without ambassador took place.
Robert Barber was approved by the United States Assembly in January 2015 and worked shortly later, but no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was a political order, not a diplomate, but a lawyer, and had supported Baracks Obama’s elections.
He left his job as soon as Donald Trump accepted the Presidential Office, January 20, 2017, as the habit of politically appointed ambassadors.
Trump’s government was unusual to order both ambassadors and high - position officials in the Washington government system.
So two years later, until the U.S. meeting announced Jeffrey Ross Gunter at his meeting to question and confirm the end of the missionary in Iceland.
In his testimony at the meeting, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been broken by the Dutch mountain.
Gunter, a political commissioner, was previously a Californian skin doctor, and has been prominent in the Jewish organization of the Republican Jewish Coalition, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
The casino owner Sheldon Adelson established them, but Adelson is an enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter worked in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, the longest example of this country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s control was to necessize people in key offices as and that the work of the American Assembly has been very slow, including the confirmation of a ambassador in office.
As a result, since 2009, there has been a total of five years of unambassadors in Iceland.
However, it has not prevented the implementation of the Embassy’s roads that recently opened the headquarters at Engjateig.
The operations are estimated to have cost some 6.5 billion, but the knees of safety walls cover the building and a gun glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the present ambassador’s sense of security because he is told to fear his life and has desired a armed lifeguard.
The former player in IBV became racial in Iceland - “There was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tonny Mawejje, former player of IBV, says he's been racial when he was in Iceland and he's looking after coming to the country.
This is seen in a interview with Tonny, which appears on the Ugandian medium Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC, who plays in the Upper Division of Uganda.
In the interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny discusses many things, including his time in this country, with IBV, Val, and Evolution in Iceland.
“ When I arrived in Iceland, I did not play on the center as I used to play.
The team's team was in that position, but also he was with the tray number I wanted so I didn't get any of what I wanted," says Tonny, but he played on the right side of the game with IBV.
Among what Tonny is talking about is a racialism that he suffered in Iceland.
He says that this is a problem that many black players are facing when playing in Europe.
“ This once happened to me, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I heard about the matter, and then I asked my friend what the matter is about.
Then he told me that my opposer had made a racial pronunciation upon me after I had deceived him."
In 2014, Tonny went from Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugesund.
There he says he has made the mistakes he sees most.
Tonny hadn’t come to Haugesund’s first team, but he wanted to play more to get to the country team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on a loan, and he went along with Val.
“ It was a mistake to return to Iceland.
I think if I had been longer in Norway, I would have had the opportunity I wanted," says tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably be further.
He wants to say that the loan to Iceland has made off his dreams of getting into the big team in Europe.
Find a worm in a woman's neck
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found 3.8 metres of black worm in a woman's necklace who was looking for it.
The doctors managed to pull out the worm with a tang.
A study revealed that the species of sneakers were involved.
CNN's reporting.
A few days earlier, the woman had eaten sashim, which is thin meat.
Soon after the worm was removed, the woman improved, but sneaking animals such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, after sushi robbed to a bed in the western countries, cases of sneaking animals have increased.
Fear that other waves are starting in Europe
Spain is now in a fireplace related to concerns about the other wave of the crown virus in Europe, where governments have taken action to re-establish the spread of the crown virus epidemic.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are growing.
Other European countries have also taken action as a result of the increase in infections in Spain, but in Britain all have to go to a disease at the home of Spain, as in Norway, and France has been warned about travelling to Spain.
In France and Germany, there is also an increase in squads, where governments try to find a balance between the spread of the virus and the rehabilitation of economic life.
However, the situation in Europe is good in relation to other parts of the world, but the world's new incidence is nearly 300 000 a day, which is considered to be the most infected in America and South Asia.
According to John Hopkins University, confirmed infections have been 16 million worldwide, and deaths confirmed to the virus are 644 thousand.
Mosaic Works Laund at last to Beautyful
In front of the Toll House in Reykjavík is a big and deep hole.
There are orange helmets on the top of it.
There's a big grave, too.
And more smaller machinery.
The gate is closed for traffic.
Yet, the corridor is good, and there are many who are now standing by and respecting artistic works of millions of mosaica — just as they have never seen before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least it was not respected for itself.
The work has been somewhat hidden right in front of cars that were always in place.
People put there, locked the car in a snare, and then jumped out to take care of their business in the city.
The "life and diversity of public space" and "attracting urban winds" are a guide to the reconstruction of the current Security Gate.
The goal is to glorify the area, allowing the Musaik’s work to be more enlightened by a Holy Daughter at the Toll House.
Besides the job, a square will be reached, and where the area is well located at the sun, it is considered appropriate to be a residential area for roaders.
The artwork will be explained and now make the material nutrient more enjoyable than before on this 142 - meters - surface.
In the area, there are also small “smoking sprays, ” some kind of water clouds that offer a game and give the area a certain eclipse.
In this way, the reimbursement is described by Reykjavíkur City, which is carried out in conjunction with Veiten.
Renewable water vessels, pyretics, and electrical vessels.
Many of them have come to their ages, but the schools and the cold water layers have been from 1925 and have thus served inhabitants and businesses in the middle of the city for a few centuries.
When the gate is reopened, cars can drive her again.
However, it will be a single path and will in turn create a more calm and accessible space for walking.
In a study of the Tollhouse on the web of the tax manager, the house was used in 1971, but its architect was Gisli Halldor’s son.
Because of the slope of the port through the house, 250 square feet [250 m] of windowless walls were made up to the street.
Construction committee and architects agreed that such floods would have a bad impact on the overall portrait, if no special measures were taken to pride the house’s appearance.
Thus, members agreed to calculate by putting up permanent artistic works there.
During that time, a great word was made by a artistic daughter of Helga.
She had worked a lot on musical works in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was to contact her first before it was decided whether the job would be competitive.
It had often been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the harbour, since the harbour had been liphy of Reykjavik since it was made.
At the time of discussion with the artist, she became a tramp of such work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other help before she returned from a country, where she would work with the suggestions from abroad.
When she returned home, she made a few suggestions for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the job.
In addition, it was desired to make an overall agreement with it and the famous artwork firm in Germany, Oidtmann Brothers, but Gerd had long worked with them to set up famous artworks across Europe.
Contracts were concluded, and Gerd worked the artwork under the installation of the brothers, who then took care of the installation of the Tollhouse.
All the work was very well done, both by the half of the Sheol daughter and by the Oidtman brothers, says the summary.
Since then, it has endured an unblooded Irish weather.
It took about two years to do the work that was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the completion of the Tollhouse work, only 47 years old.
Prepare the transfer of more seats to land
The Associated Minister of Social Affairs, Einar Dadason, announces that more official bodies will be transferred to the country next.
This was what a minister of the Expensive Division said at the Lunch.
Recently, it was announced that the House-National and Human Relations Agency will be transferred north to South Africa in autumn.
Six experts in the field of burning work at the Agency, but none of them intend to follow the North Agency and have criticized the country relations of fireplace and sickness transporters.
“ I think we should take further steps in this creature.
I'm preparing further steps in this creature.
More transport," said Ásmundur.
If he is convinced that a large majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of the public organizations around the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of official work to the country, just as I was doing with the House’s and Man’s Agency,” said Ásmundur, but he also took an example of other agencies that have been transferred to the country and made a significant contribution to foreign communities, such as the transport of foodstuffs to Selfoss, Iceland’s Countries to Akraness and jobless security at Skagastrand.
All the most important from the second day of the Master Congress
The most important part of Iceland in liberal sports ended on the Thors Valley of Akureyri today.
Some meetings were made on the second competition day.
It was calculated with an exciting competition in the women's battleship at Thorsvelli, while Vigdís John's daughter from the FH put Icelandsmet in a war wardrobe in 2014, which stood until Elisabeth Rut Rúnar's daughter of the IR added to May in the past.
Vigdís won Iceland back in the past summer and has been in a fantaform in the past, but it has been three - year - old Icelandic assessments.
Elishabed Ruth has suffered injury and has not struck himself today.
She had only one valid cast of five, throwing 25,69 metres, which is far from her best.
Vigdís cast the longest of all today, or 60.08 metres in her last experiment, and instantly put a match.
Her Icelandic score she set earlier in July is 62,69 feet [62,69 m], so she was a little away from it.
Karita’s Hallgrím daughter, the godruine of the IR, had the best shot in the day, and she added her best result with a box of 50,18 feet [50,18 m].
In a man's group, the Hilmar Earn Johnsson, the Icelandic Mether in a wardrobe, won a safe victory, but he thrown 73.84 metres in his next last box and put an advent.
His Icelandic score in this article is 75,26 feet [75,26 m].
The gods of the Godna son of God, Olympia, and the Icelandic Meth in a circular, won a race on a bullet TV at Thorsvall last night, but today he raced in a circumcision that is his main part.
The Icelandic God of Vals is 65,53 feet [65,53 m] than he threw the longest 59,13 feet [59,13 m] today and guaranteed its victory.
Valdimar Hjalti, the son of Erlend, cast next to the day, but he had one valid cast that worked at the second seat, 49,43 feet [49,43 m].
Havdis Victory daughter, a long-sized Icelandic Metro, won the long-term competition with superiors, but Hafdis jumped at the longest 6.25 metres today, nearly 40 cm from its Icelandic level.
In the 200 metres of women, it was the IR King Godbjörg Jona Bjarn daughter, who was targeted in 24,04 seconds, but her Icelandic score in the article is 23,45 seconds.
Jonah was victorious in Akureyri, but she won two golden prizes yesterday, 100 metres [100 m] and 4 x 100 metres [100 m] [4 x 400 m] of a council today.
In a man’s group, Colbein Haughter of the Son of Gunnar, from the FH, was the first to the 200 metres of the race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before the son of Oliver, Samuel, of the Yearman.
Like Jonah’s God - bearing, Colbent Hair won gold in the 100 metres of yesterday as well as in the 400 metres [400 m] of the race.
Do not pay a debt for a $27 million bitcoin crop
The excess committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who claimed to pay a person for disproportionately disproportionate amounts of funds that were incurred due to the sale of Bitcoin.
The note concludes that a tax investigator had not made clear evidence of the need to pay a man.
The Committee’s decision suggests that a tax investigator believed that the man had recorded materially wrong tax transactions due to the revenues of 2016 and 2017.
He would have unpredicted his funds that were available because of the sale of Bitcoin’s electrical coins of 27 million, either deliberately or of great shepherdlessness.
The man should be seized for his pride.
The man therefore rejected the committee in a letter.
However, he agreed to sell an electrical coin for 27 million in 2016.
He would have obtained a funeral in 2009 and 2010 when such things were both easy and uncovered with normal homework.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electrical coins, tax executions for such sales were very unclear and unprecedented.
It would have been appropriate to expect public citizens to recognize such provisions on tax payments.
He would not have meant to avoid paying tax on the harvest, and he would have recognised his ownership of a statement as an indication of a currency bill.
He would have asked both experts and government tax managers about how this would be done but without any success.
Then he felt that he needed to take into account that he was not born or raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began to dig for Bitcoin.
Thus, he would have been in a worse position than others to explore complicated rules that the tax authorities would not have made a clear view of.
The man rightly thought that his taxes for these two revenue years would be redetermined and pressured, but otherwise no punishment would be made.
Then he recovered that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in this country since 2012.
He would never have meant to fulfill his responsibilities in a disadvantaged manner.
The requirement for debt would be out of the scale and would pour it into debt.
"This man understands what football is"
Andersen Willumsson's brewl has been considerably between the teeth of the people, but also awakening as a result of his progression of what's left with the Breathing moment in the Pepsi Max department.
The lights will be in the fireline tonight when they take the IA in a direct broadcast at Stand 2 Sports.
The breezes take off the ban because of four reminders at the playtime, so they do not come to play with a new cut like in the summer’s games.
He had written “bla, bla, bla” on his head for the game at the HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“ I don’t know who he was answering with the payment, but speaking about character, it was better to try in the game.
He didn't hide.
He wants to get the ball at every time and if there was someone going to balance this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Godmundur Benedikt son in the Pepsi Max chair, when considered to be a brilliant.
“I’m supposed to be here for the people.”
“ Sometimes it is difficult to figure out what he is in.
He looks out a little on the left when it begins to feel at the game, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hervar, the son of the sea.
Thorkell Máni Petersson says that Brynjulf is real entertainment and is glad to have such a colorful man in the branch: “No one shares that this is a character.
This is a funny type and I love this with my hair, and to be always ready to meet and answer in interviews.
It's amazing a lot of people busy with him, who tells me that this man understands what a football is.
“ I am an entertainment force.
I'm supposed to stay here for the people and enjoy it."
The people are reading the interviews with Brynjulf, paying in and watching what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said moon.
Player KR says that you want to leave the company - "I've been in contact with some teams in the B department"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max department, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish center of Bold, Tobias is ready to go back to Denmark.
Football.net also reported the matter.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the period in his homeland, but for that he must first terminate his contract at the CR, where the Danish department starts before the Irish chance.
The company knows that I miss Danmarks and has shown me a lot of understanding," said Tobias in a conversation with Bold.
“ I have been in contact with a few teams in the B department and I will probably change before the Irish period ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can allow themselves to pay up my contract at KR."
Then he says that he is likely to need a lower wage in Denmark.
"Features in Denmark have probably felt more of the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland."
The Bicycle Wizard Bjartmar has recovered a bicycle for millions - Now answers after DV
For more than a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had an interest in others.
He sweeps up and saves lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles, and vessels.
Has Bjartmar gained the name “the bike whisper” for this purpose.
Last night, when a man published a record of his relations with Bjartmar, he became so much a feather.
The DV then referred to the Facebook group of Western Beths, showing that Bjartmar had taken the man to talk on the eastern part and said that the puzzle might be stolen.
There was nothing else to read from the original writings of the electrical castle but that Bjartmar thieved it.
The text has now been changed to Facebook and the prescription of the original news of the DV has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar does not describe the original news of the matter at all for what really happened yesterday in the East.
Bjartmar said that they have received information from the victims of an electrical cluster that they were truly their electrical castles.
The information was given to the owner of others, but the information was wrong, says Bjartmar.
“ I looked at the guy, and I knew about the box, because with information about that there was an electrical tape that had been missed for a very long time and was looking for.
Surely I hesitated first, but when I saw him prepare to drive on the shirt, I decided to quit talking to the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to talk to the man.
Generally I'm going very good in such a matter, but before I got to finish what I had to say, the man had taken away from me."
Bjartmar says that the man on the electrical castle also invited him to show him the receipt for the wheel and himself called to the police.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "Let's just get this clean."
Then the owner of the electrical tray proved his owner’s ownership and went on.
Later, as reported in the previous news, the right owner of the electric cartridge told his history on Facebook.
During this bed year that Bjartmar has pursued, he says he can count the times he had on the side of people on another hand.
“ I have had peaceful relations with the most difficult men of Reykjavík, ” said Bjartmar, indicating that bicycle thieves are most commonly the smallest brothers and sisters of the community, fools, psychotics, and other people who are partly on the street.
“The addiction is a hard master and somehow needs to finance the next dose, because unfortunately, the thief of such a discharge is an easy way to that goal," says Bjartmar.
“ My relationship with these people is really so good that I have come with many of the good people with me.
There are examples that people went on treatment and took up and then came to me and helped me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, the contact of Bjartmar with the bicycles on courtesy notes.
Some know about him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him the recruitments, the stealing numbers, and so on.
The bicycle thief is a big problem that has been discussed in a little way.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police are even starting to point people to talk to him out of stolen bicycles.
Brightness is inconsistent with the first newstransmission of DV and does not claim to be individually self-defined police in personal search for justice.
Asked if he isn't at the throat of ice by his operation, and whether this is not the first of the role of the police, says Bjartmar so surely be.
“ Of course, the cops should do this, but the fact is that the police are simply not doing this.
I've got to picture a look up at policemen driving away from a big bunch of stolen bikes.
She's purely outright in these matters."
“ When the cops are not doing anything in this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown that I can succeed in this class of matters, then why not? ”
He says he has achieved so much success in having on stolen bicycles, that sometimes he hits his “protectives” on the street that then they had just right the Brighter wheels they had previously reached in.
The times that Bjartmar has called for police help have happened that she just doesn't come.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owners of the bicycles to blame, ” said Bjartmar, and it’s a pity that the victims of the bicycle thief need to suffer from an empty police in this category.
The results of Bjartmar are not divided.
Many people can find stories of people thanks to Bjartmari for having gained their possessions again.
For a long time, Bjartmar himself says that it has lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but it is obvious that the amounts will run over millions, if not millions of decades.
Weighting electricity flushing, electric bicycles, and heavy electric cars, but electric bicycles may cost up to half a million.
Brightnesses work at the school for a day, and each weekend he works in a home.
Hence, his bicycle search is an unpaid work that he does during his vacation.
Life’s Funds and Long Shadows
In 2019, there was a great birthday year in the history of life - ears in Iceland.
True, officials had received a reward from King Dana from all the streets from the 19th century, but in 1919 the organic ears of officials were set up, eventually as the organ of all officials.
The foundation for the current live ears of general wages was then set by a comprehensive core contract on the labour market in 1969, where a professionally-related life-eye fee was announced with a compulsory and valid coal collection from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, laws were put on the basis of these contracts, and the life - ear system continued to increase.
The lifestyle of the wages was not the only radical change that the 20th - century labor forced by their ceramic struggle.
In 1955, unemployed security had been similar in history - of - work conflicts, and the organization also gradually became progressive in its demands for sickness and sickness, serious freedom of leave, shortening the working time, improvements in home affairs, and more.
All these rights cost a huge and rigid struggle, but it remained to be, much greater and more lasting cerabote than the increase in the wages in the wage environment, which disappeared as hard as a result of the heat of the inflammation that characterized the period after war and until 1990, as many remember.
The attorney to the establishment of the general organ of life - ears in 1969 was both long and complex.
Even though humans finally came together that the funds would actually be owned by cowboys, the trade union movement had to agree that their governments were to be appointed representatives of professionals and councils as well.
In the next few years after the institution of the funds, the requirement for the majority of workers in the government of the funds was often discussed in the council, but it was never done, so we still have the abnormal arrangement that representatives of councils are not in the majority of the governments of the treasury.
In Article 36, Law No 129/1997 on the obligation to guarantee the rights of life-eye and the functioning of life-eye taxes, the investment policy of the treasury is addressed.
The first figure says that “a life - ear fund will have the interests of a colonel to lead. ”
The fifth figure also states: “The treasure of life is to set moral standards in investment. ”
In the Biosheet's policy, the following provisions, in addition to the preceding legislation, include:
The Life Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PRI) regulations on investments, together with many of the largest organic funds and professionals of the Western Sea and Europe.
The rule will discuss how the emphasis on environmental and social matters as well as good governance of companies can contribute to the improvement of the investment results of the securities collection.
Thus, the interests of investment and the goals of the society are in a broader context.
The LV considers it important that communities, especially those registered on the shareholder markets, adopt a public approach: to maintain a good governance course for social and environmental responsibility.
The value of life, which has the largest funds in the country, has set itself a 'policy of responsible investment' and there are similar provisions.
This is all mentioned here as the introduction to the newest word of the Iceland, "shadow management".
Since the word is new in the matter, it is not hoped that it has been defined, but the following definition now appears to be “mast taken”: Shadow management is when a lecture leader in a media says that he will send the social representatives to the government of the body’s ears orders or instructions on how to take a position in a particular case.
If they do not follow the instructions, they will be disfellowshipped from the government with the first ability.
However, if the leader does not bring this into the media and does not talk about a statement, it is not “shadow management” but, of course, there is always a relationship between human beings in the financial world like elsewhere.
I let the reader think about the way he feels “more shadowful. ”
In particular, there are two men who have tried to form this definition when it is written, at the morning of Saturday 25 July 2020.
These are the Horth, the son of Eye, a journalist on the newspaper, and Asgeir Johnsson, the director of the banks.
The reason was that Bogi Nils Bogason, chief Icelandair, had told them of the purpose of suspending the company’s contracts with air freights and flight servants (reporting them), and Ragnar Thor Ingólfsson, Chairman of the Marketing Society of Reykjavík, sent them out the recommendations to the representatives of the Society of Life Rise Traders not to support the potential purchase of the fund of shares in the company, or they might be deviated.
A few years later, Bogi Nils resigned his decision, and afterward, Ragnar Thord went the same way with his instructions that of course were in line with Boga’s decision.
Yet, they saw a reason for discussing the matter in the Friday newspaper with great words about shadow management, law enforcement, and a great need for changes in law.
There would indeed be a small dove to wonder about a heavy league, even though the blessed due had been in the process of interconnection and, in addition, was quickly wiped out.
Since the matter is important, consider the matter itself at the end.
I first followed the elements of the laws on a life-eye meal that are subject to this matter.
These include the need for councils to maintain the interests of councils and have moral criteria in investments, and these factors are made more closely available in the agreement of both Gildis and the Lifestyle of traders, as I mentioned.
On the other hand, lifebows should not look at the short time of their investments.
This would be a very dangerous approach, and it is not necessary to seek for a long time to judge such things in the past, where large borrowing banks and funds have led to immoral adventures and environmental harassment, with harmful consequences.
Chairman of Icelandair was obviously on ice when he thought that he would wipe out a whole group of employees, thus drastically reduce the welfare of the company in the Icelandic markets and weaken its position in relation to investments.
Fortunately, he saw and drew it back.
The time reveals whether it is sufficient for the investment of life - ears in the community to be accountable to councils at the time.

One of the Infected Membranes Did Not Return
One of the three who reported with Covid-19 on the country last night came to the country from the Baltic Sea on July 15, the last, about one and a half weeks ago.
He is an Islean who, however, is not regularly inhabited here, was not given clear instructions to take the so - called home - defense after coming to the country and go to another show for a few days after his arrival.
He got a negative discretion at the border.
“ But he is in the Icelandic community and is really supposed to go to that, ” says Kamilla Joseps daughter, a healthcare specialist in the field of medical care and a standard antibiotic while he is on summer vacation, in conversation with the newspaper today.
“He used the English registration form and is not obliged to register the identification number and if the identification number is not registered, you are not automatically announced in the second view.”
She says that the man could have used the English form because he is actually resident in a foreign country, but because of his relationship in the country as an Icelandic, he should have rather used it in English.
Yet, he did not realize this.
“ When the identification is not recorded, you need to try to get yourself in the second show.
Neither he nor his employer seemed to have realized that it was the right way," said Kamilla.
“ Thus, it is clear that we need to enhance the information about this while we find some way to make an automatic preaching system, even though Icelands do not record their identification numbers.
Or to do it somehow more obvious who are participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Congratulations, however, are few of those who come to the country, even though they are defined as a participant in the Islamic community, a resident of Iceland.
Only six have been sent to disease after he was diagnosed yesterday and all of them were in contact with him.
They are going to be shown, but two of them are starting to show the symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
On July 15, the man received a negative response from his show at the border.
Camilla likely says that he was recently infected by the virus that she could not yet be identified in it when the vision was taken on the border.
However, she does not want to exclude the infected man here in Iceland but not carry the virus to the country.
“ It is not quite possible to claim that this is certainly an infected infection because it is long since he arrived to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused a small war in connection with the sports conventions. ”
Yet, she says that it is very unlikely because of the few people around here.
“ It’s really very unlikely, ” says Kamilla, but it claims that it cannot be excluded until the Iceland genographic analysis has been detected in the human virus.
“ If we have a virus that has not been seen here before, it is almost certain that he brought it to the land. ”
Piper sprays and bombs used against Protestants
A struggle between the police and the Protestants in Seattle last night.
Polices used pipar sprays and unchanged handbombs, but the protesters broke the tubes and turned on.
45 Protestants were arrested, and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were protested in many United States last night, but the protests in Seattle supported Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one Protestant was shot to death.
As shown on BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands of people met in peaceful protests.
Then a group of people burned into a building area and broke a row into the city’s courtroom.
Following this, the police said that the protests were inevitable, and there were conflicts between groups of Protestants and police.
Required justice In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man who was murdered by police in August last year, noted by Protestants.
A car was through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of national guardians gathered together and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman who was murdered by police in her home last March.
The group carried guns and went into captains to closed gate conventions, where the police were tied to the group of people who protested and also had guns.
At that time, 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants recalled James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white baroque in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, CEO Manchester United, doesn't want to do too much of the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final course of the English election department.
If the United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, end the sunshine and his men in the fifth seat and thus lose from the Master's Board.
However, then they still have the hope of getting to the Master Board by working the European Department next month.
“ We haven’t arrived at the end point.
If we get a step towards Leicester, I think people will say that we haven't had a bad period," said the Sunshine.
“ But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey, for we still have a significant land by reaching the two arms above us, ” said the Sunshare.
It is clear that today’s day’s nerve will be tooth, but the sunshine tried to act like each other’s game.
“ If you want to belong to Manchester United, you must be used to be under pressure in the last game of the period.
It's nothing new, and on this, the company is built.
We have made us a great opportunity to end the period well and now it's ours to use it," said the Sunshare.
“ This is not the most important game in the period, it’s just the next game.
You can ask anyone in the football, the next game is always the most important one.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many hours to define this period."
“The coming of Bruno Fernandes changed much for us, and I think that we are in a better shape and much stronger spiritually than in the last period,” said the Sunshare.
65,000 infections on sunshine
65,490 new infections of the crown virus were diagnosed in the United States yesterday, according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4.178,021 have been confirmed from the beginning of the epidemic in the country.
The virus killed 900 last four days until the virus died more than 1,000 a day.
Overall, 146.460 deaths have been confirmed in the United States.
The CNN news reports that, according to the predictory US Antidefense Authority, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000, 15 August next.
Fear the other waves of the epidemic
The government in Spain is now trying to resume the increase in COVID-19 spread in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more reports in one day from the beginning of May and the reports at the same time as Spain begins to eliminate one of the most striking bans in Europe.
The relapse led to the fact that the British authorities now have passengers coming from Spain to go to a pathogen at home.
A week earlier, Spain was on the British list of safe states.
The situation is the worst in Catalonia in the northeast of Spain, where governments have reached more widespread limits to try to reach a level of growth.
In the capital of Barselona, entertainment sites will be closed in the next two weeks, and oldhouses will be closed at midnight.
This is now true for 200 thousand inhabitants of the Segria region in the western part of Catalonia.
It is estimated that British decision will have a negative effect on Spanish economics that are very angry with foreign travelers and are badly played after the passport.
Thui, the largest United Kingdom travel office, dismissed all the flights planned today to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Worldwide governments are said to prepare themselves for the second wave of the passport, but there seems to be little interest in taking back into a vast ban of expiry that has devastated the economy in many parts of the world.
To illustrate this, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken very bad action, comparing it with nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
Then, Jean Castex, Prime Minister of France, said that the nation “will not survive, prosperous or socially,” if it was reappeared to the land - wide expiry ban.
Hopefully, many ministers hope for the local measures that will reach the inhabitants of individual cities, cities, or territories will be sufficient to retain the virus during the next journey.
Five New Infections in Iceland - Three Inland
Last night, three inland smits were diagnosed, in addition to two additional to the borders.
Thus, five subjects were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infection yesterday in Iceland.
In a public protection report, one infection is associated with the infection reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football convention.
He has been sent to isolation and to sixteen who were in close contact with him in a disease.
The infected person was involved in the social work of the Sports Society in Reykjavík and is, according to the report, “only part of the sport” in the disease.
Others who were sent in a nutrient are related to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unseen and infectious in the body of the State Police Infections.
Congress holders of the ReyCUP Convention have applied the instructions and regulations of the adhesive physician and human protection remaining and have taken appropriate measures.
Yet, pictures of the convention were awakened yesterday, where a very close association was allowed to celebrate the good luck of their team outside the field.
Just before 11 o'clock today, the advertisers published the following notification on their Facebook page.
It says: “ATTH: Parents please respect the rules that competitors themselves pick up their stuff at school.
Parents are not allowed to do so.
Thank you for showing understanding."
Another infection was reported yesterday but related to the infection reported in the morning.
The report states: “Islen genetic analysis has detected the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been identified here before. ”
In this case, an infectious person is also infected in isolation and 12 in a disease caused by the infection.
The third infection that was discussed is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
He was diagnosed in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close contact with him in a disease.
Two of them have already shown the symptoms of virus infection.
In addition, two were diagnosed at the border and are waiting for further studies, such as a career in infection at the border.
Finally, the report states: The State Police Department of Public Warning and the Office of Agricultural Medicinal Products require careful care and care for individual infectious agents.
If there is any doubt about the presence of the Covid-19 virus, the same person is asked to take a show at the next healthcare station.
Patriarch tells the tabernacle booked about the sanctuary of sales - Behind visitors else
The Palace Tent is full over the weekend, according to the announcement of the West.
When visitors point to consider other guests’ opportunities.
What is the Western Valley of Bildu, the Talk, the Melanes of Redasandi, the Hotel Flocalund, and the Hotel of Great Britain as a different option in the position?
It is enough to be at the Patriarchy of this weekend, for as the previous year, the shield city will be held in the city, the festival of the Israelite images.
It has been held since 2007, so it has become a stronger tradition in town.
An application in the tabernacle to judge can be expected this year, if weather does not weather, but DV earlier today reported a defective prophecy.
But may there be the worst weather southward, and the hope of the Patriarchs.
The web bb.is first told, and said that all other accommodations in towns were already full - booked.
A whole multi - city house caves down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live freely at Dunhaga 18-20.
While owners are seeking refurbishment permits, their responsibilities have changed in the system for the third years.
In one of the oldest, greenest, most expensive neighborhoods of the city of Reykjavik, there is a glorious three - height complex.
On the floor of the house, there is about 600 square meters of shop.
At the back of the house are the doors of two stages, which each holds four rather glorious apartments.
They are between 93 and 130 square meters, although most of them are over 100.
The house has a huge history.
It was built in 1959, including videos, the Scoroom, the Milk Camp, the Jehoa guns, the fish sale, and the last high school print.
The house has, as it is said, remembered his foe more beautifully.
The house is now under great damage, as can be seen in the following pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
Owners of D18 ehf. are based on a company register among other Magnus Magnus son and Godrun Helga Lárus daughter.
Magnus was the owner of the Payment Group and was the defender of the Payment Society.
A group of owners of the Payment Company is a Steelship.
Steel vessel, e.g., is a Godruns Hilton Lárus daughter and her children.
Godrun is also the owner of the third part of the D18 ehf.
Godrun, and her husband, August Godmundur the son of Sigurd, once robbed the steel vessel.
D18 e.g. bought the house in the summer of 2009, so little as nothing has been held since then.
Says neighbors that the situation of the house has progressed steadily since, though most in recent years.
On the Facebook - page of the neighborhood, one inhabitant says that the house “wasn’t very lifeful last years. ”
It may play a role in the fact that owners have for several years strive to change the house and the land.
Other neighbors say that the house has not been well for a long time.
“ It’s a long time to do something nice to this spot and awkward that this has become so. ”
In addition, he says he is insulted in the owners of the house because he has not done it, found some common plate with the neighbors of the house, and quit this “lawstone. ”
“Do this just in consultation with society around so that it can be done and finished.”
The legal instrument referred to in the inhabited is the organisational process of the field which has been running at least since 2017.
Then the owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 were asked to build the height of the current building and behind the house, a new elevator, and a renovation in one height, along with a basement.
The building permit granted for that implementation was addressed to the Committee on the Environment and Resources Committee, and the Committee dismissed it from the value where the implementation was not supported in a division and the basic report was not satisfactory.
Smoking City then started with a divisional work and ended it with an advertisement in the Governing News in July last year.
That organization was also dealt with and the Committee disfellowshipped it in March 2020.
So at that point, nearly three years were over from the initial application of the building permit and the owners of the house at the beginning.
At that time, the house had suffered a great deal, and neighbors were getting tired.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house in the situation and the neighbor’s reactions, the answers were in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the purposes of the house owners, others at all.
Others directed anger to the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but no one was necessarily angry.
Others said that the car situation was a lizard, but neighbors have a new unused parking area of Dunhaga 18 to 20 under their vehicles.
One complainant in this case said that he was long tired of the government:
“ That we need to go through the course for three times is quite amazing.
It's like the city of Reykjavik couldn't read."
Today, the house is empty, left, and is neglected.
A memorial of the city’s government and the fines of the owner’s intentions and many years of work of those who are at the beginning.
When the newspaper took a park at Dunhaga 18.
Playstation computers and a recent television were within another waste on earth — the victims of the Ice Summer Light.
There was an open office in the old college printing office, and there was a number of cats of the humor to judge.
Clearly, someone has stirred around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Staples of sofa and beds and some sheets of geography pages that were probably to become a book, blew up.
The gates of the apartment were also open and lived in both of them.
A journalist was so lucky to hit the people of one of them.
There, the Romanians were to make a potato right for dinner and invite a journalist.
The Romanians work for the Ztrongforce employee ehf.
They have been there for some time and simulated DV's claims that the company paid nothing for the home except heat and electricity.
Because of the situation in the house, it does not seem defensive to rent.
Because of the situation of mail at the door of the house, it is clear that there have lived a number of foreign workers in the last misery.
The Covid-19 situation has not been undertaken by the employee's bill, since the convergence in travel led to the convergence of the building and these two traders were the most effective use of the service of the employee.
Yet, in Dunhaga 18 householders seemed to have enough to do, and the work gaps and the councils were dropped to thirsty after a long working day in the rain.
It should be said that despite the disgusting situation of the house, the apartment that the boys disagreed seemed to be well maintained.
When a reporter cited the boys in bedland, he suddenly became clear: In the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of property is down.
Owners want to change the house to improve and neighbours want to improve the situation, but share the definition of "favour".
The city's organisational area is between the beginning of the city, the victim of endless procurement routes and the appreciation of the organisational process and the dissolved Swifting Committee on Environmental and Resources.
In the house, so bednish workers live, perhaps just those who are going to improve the situation when the Isleans stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the weekend newspaper DV 17 July.
In a struggle against overweight following the crown virus epidemic
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds in a war against overweight, which will include the ban on sudden advertisements, due to his serious illness, partly because of his weight.
Today, Johnson presents the campaign called Better Happiness tomorrow, Monday, but during the campaign, doctors are encouraged to prescribe bicycles for their refugees in overweight and will be attacked with the increase in bicycle trails.
Then, according to the British media’s sources, radio - television advertisements will be killed by 9: 00 a.m.
"COVID-19 has awakened us with regard to short and long-term risks of overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we need to use time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier food," said the President of the Government.
Johnson himself has faced weight problems, but he was put into complete care when he was infected by the crown virus in ours, and is partly to his weight because he is considered so seriously weakened.
Women Better Throwing the Changes
She said that the new regime was the greatest step that the nation can take to strengthen power, opposition, and combat corruption and the interests of the whole.
“ We need to change a little now, and who is better to make such changes than that of the community that is easier to live in these values.
There are women," said Helga.
“ Women in Iceland are famous for their female status.
Stay together and be together in bringing changes.
So now we're just going to lead these changes."
It said she was a little anxious about the emphasis on Iceland as “the best in the world” in both gender and human rights.
“ Then we are not as ready to consider what to do.
Like Germans, they are very conscious of their history and consider everything that needs to be done.
It's a bunch.
We need to know where we are coming from and knowing the story and listening.
Listen to the voices of bordered groups.
We don't all live by the same rules here," said Helga.
She asked women to be in good matters in Iceland in many ways but added that, like many other places, Icelands were building a great male value.
She said that politics turned to form their own interests, authority, and powers, which were the forces that maintained discrimination in all communities.
“ Women have now set up this group and come together and have just become a little bit intimidated because the Aleconung is going to take a trick to look forward to this 2012 national constituency, ” she said.
“ There are these female values that we are thinking about.
From human rights and natural protection, cooperation and that we are all really sitting at the same table," she said, adding that the former values were the basics of the new government.
“ We are a very rich land of natural humility, and it is ridiculous that there are people living with poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can divide differently," said Helga.
“ It’s ridiculous that there is some natural law that women’s work is always lower.
It's ridiculous that airlines and nurses need to be in a ceramic fight forever just to get the human pay."
The list of signatures on a new management file can be signed here through an electronic Icelandic system.
Trying to rob a walking roadway in the middle of the city
A man was arrested in the city of the middle of the night after he threatened the walking passengers and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in the city of Arbach, where two were arrested because of the matter.
Then the police stopped the motorcycle driver in the Holes, where its driver was at 146 km speed, with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driving rights.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn tonight, and more than 80 cases were recorded in police journals from five yesterday to five tomorrow.
At that time there was a lot of noise advertisements due to consensus.
On Saturday, an announcement of eleven loud festivals was made, and it was a great deal in the police journal.
On the other hand, in the night 22 noises robbed the police.

In addition, police officers stopped a driver who drew a wheelchair on Kjalarnesi yesterday.
The wheelchair's equipment, according to police journal, was in a "very bad state" and was stopped.
It's possible to stay in Monet's house on the retail sanctuary.
The house that the impressive Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his exercise is now a rent on the Airbnb page.
The next loose night in the house is about the sales sanctuary.
The house is small and creepy, located in the town of Givenry, Normandie, France.
From 1883 until his death in 1926, the globe of the world lived in the house.
In the house there are three bedrooms, two seats, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone plans to rent the house, he must rent at least two nights.
According to Airbnb’s page, it is next free after a week, on Sunday of the sales sanctuary, so it could be the option for some traders on vacation to book the painter’s house.
The two nights above sales sanctuary cost only 964 American valleys or just over 130,000 Italian kroners as soon as the newspaper arrives.
Thousands of disease and some of them begin to show signs of the disease caused by the crown virus
In the last three days, five have been diagnosed with the coronary virus and most of the infected are unrelated.
Thousands have suffered from these diseases, and some of them are starting to show the symptoms of the virus.
Three were diagnosed with the coronary virus in the country yesterday and two at the border skiing.
According to a physician’s office, the growing number of inland squads does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely into the community.
“ It has been seen from the previous inland smit, and it is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no special reason to believe that it has been concealed in society for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful now," said Kamilla Sigrid Joseph's daughter, a specialist in the health care of the local doctor's office.
Most of them have been infected with people from abroad.
More evidence is done next than some who were in contact with the infected have shown the symptoms of the crown virus.
“Now there is no influenza in progress and reminds us of other respiratory infections so we can be quite free to do these tests in individuals who had found reason to do something else first," said Kamilla.
At the most time, but it is not excluded that more people need to go into a nutrition.
Two of the infected were diagnosed after a sports event.
Has it raised questions whether such events are defensive?
As long as people comply with standards and rules, the general public protection communication manager is very slow.
Kamilla almost excludes the infected at the sports conventions.
“ If there are no more in isolation from these individuals after associating them at these sports conventions, we can say that our adventures at the conventions have worked.
But it is not revealed," said Kamilla.
The task of the Public Defence Department is in a constant review.
“We need to be ready to intervene with further advice or limitations if that appears to be a reason,” said Kamilla.
After a week, there is a number of limits to be cleared up to a thousand people.
This new situation may affect the dealings.
"Determined meditation to cook" - See the appetite of Eliza Vidar
The daughter of Eliza Viar is an ultimate football in a rocket and plays with Val.
She is also a master of nutrition, a mother, and serves as a foodologist.
It takes much energy for the worst of the day and usually takes time to cook good and nutrient food.
My usual day begins to get to work from eight," says Elisha.
“ After work, I go to the store to prepare the dinner before I get my girl to the school at three o’clock. ”
Elisha feels very nourishing to attend his daughter early at the school.
“ It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice the second part.
After practice, it's good to come home and just need to warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl's asleep, we'd like to look at one part to clear our mind."
Elisha does not follow any food.
She is putting her hands on a master’s art in nutrient science and knowing how to eat enough energy to work, school, family, and exercise.
“ I am suitable for eating a variety of foods that are well composed of proteins, hydrocarbons, and fat.
However, I feel that it is most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to class food into bad or good, rather nutrient, or nutrition.
It's really all right to eat everything, just not all at once and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
“ I feel a certain meditation in standing in the kitchen to cook and so get very much into it.
I have to say that the self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I really believe that I am a good cook."
Morning food: Seas, chia seeds, hampers, salt, little citrus juice, left in male milk overnight.
Pull this meal up with what is available each time.
Most of them are bananas and jumped Musli & KAFFI.
I'm a lot of coffee.
Intermediate: Unbelievably different, but fruits or vegetables, flat cakes, clean shirts with bananas and muslime, bread with legs, and then I could eat hummos with a bowl from box if so happens.
Midday meal: I often prepare for a variety of foodstuffs from what is in the ice cabinet, chinoa, or building, false balls, rock salads, hobby vegetables with good dressing is something I work with.
If the organization is completely off (which happens often) then the ovary at work has made me quite a lot to save, and then there are two bread cuttings with butter, cheese, and soft eggs, don't put more on you.
Intermediate: Give me something carbonateful for exercises, bread with legs, morning grain, or fruit.
Evening dinner: Fish will be very often for the choice in my home, or some lovely vegetables.
Conflicts between police and Protestants in Seattle
The city authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a rebellion situation following numerous protests in the city.
Last night, police grabbed bombs and peppers in order to tempt to rust a large area that protesters undertake and overwhelmed many hallways in the neighborhood of the city’s assembly house.
The police announced on Twitter that at least eleven Protestants had been arrested and that a study was conducted at a police station in the city yesterday, possible with some kind of bomb.
Citizens and police authorities say that Protestants had buryed the police with rocks, bottles, cotton bombs, and other freely, and one policeman was transferred to a hospital where his injury was caused.
However, the protest in Seattle was peaceful for a long time.
The blast was made for them to show consensus to Protestants in Portland, Oregon, where there has been repeated conflicts between Protestants and heavy - armed nations of the Federal Police.
As in other cities of the United States, people are gathering under the signs of Black Lives Matter, George Floyds, who was killed by a policeman in Minneapolis 25 May, recalls systematic racism in the U.S. society and calls for remuneration.
Not revoked until after voting
It is not yet possible whether the refusal of the airline Icelandair, which is to take effect by the next month, will be revoked.
Electronic Statement on the Icelandair airline contract ends in the afternoon tomorrow.
Lion’s Godly daughter, the president of the Society, assured that Icelandair will not make a decision on the resignation until the results of the vote are found.
“ This is cleverly hanging together, ” says Godlay Liney.
“ No refusal has been revoked, this must be put in place so that the machines can be made.
Of course, people are uncomfortable to know if they're going to have a job after the monthly convention."
The cost of a contract signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is assumed to be valid until the end of September 2025, based on a contract that airlines had previously fallen into a vote.
On July 17th, the Government and the Confidential Council of the Icelandic Airlines agreed to publish a general employment station at Icelandair, accepting it in a voting service.
Never came to her, but this was decided after Icelandair’s decision to quit discussions with the airline company, tell all her airlines, and search for contracts with another classmate.
Then the company’s pilots had to take on the work of security teams on board temporarily.
Ask her how she thinks that the voting money will go, Godlayer Liney says hard to say about it.
“ People are in pain after this operation of Icelandair, when all of the company’s airlines were cancelled and announced that the agreement was signed with another class community.
Now it shows whether it has an effect," she says.
At the end of April 940 airlines worked at Icelandair, and 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their decree is a difference, with those who have the ultimate work, when he is three months, and it ends in the monthly part of July-August.
In that group, about 90% of the Icelandair airlines are.
What does the contract do not accept?
“ Then we wish for continuing discussions with our attendants.
With this agreement, we are meeting the Icelandair requirements.
It is clear if he is rejected that the airlines think they have gone too far."
Recommendation on core contracts and Icelandair presents the second quarter of the year tomorrow
A pilot's recommendation on a new core contract ends at 12 a.m. in the morning.
Icelandair for the second quarter of the year will also be published tomorrow, but emergency ecstasy results suggest that the company’s revenue has decreased by 85 percent from the same period in the past.
Electronic vote on the Flight Company Agreement and the Icelandair Association for Business started on Wednesday 22 July and ends tomorrow, Monday 27 July, at 12 a.m.
Those who may choose the contract are employees of Icelandair who pay social fees to the Flight Company.
Icelandair and FFI signed a new core contract on Sunday, July 19, but on Friday, Icelandair had closed discussions with the company after the first agreement on the votes at the beginning of July was collapsed.
Then Icelandair had told all the airlines and the company’s flights on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new core contract was signed.
According to a new core contract, flyers have to fly five hours more a month for the same basic wage.
The core agreement is valid until 2025, which has been complied with the rules of pilots and pilots for how long it is possible to fly on one watch.
The contract was presented to FFIs at a meeting at Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday, describeing many airlines that the news offices discussed them over discomfort because of the contract.
However, the majority seemed to agree that the agreement had to be agreed to hold the FIFI alive.
Icelandair for the second quarter of the year will be presented tomorrow, but the EBIT Society, its company’s offspring for financial and taxes, is negative, according to emergency excess results, about 100 to 110 million US dollars or about 15 billion Irish kroners.
Icelandair sent the Buy Hall emergency calculations last Wednesday, which stated that the company’s income had earned about $60 million on the fourth or $8.3 billion.
Appropriate money and its equivalent were about 154 million dollars at the end of the fourth, about $21 billion.
Icelandair also aims to offer the company’s shares in August.
Icelandair aims to complete contracts with fifteen lorries, governments and Boeing aircraft manufacturers before the end of a month before part-financial broadcasting.
New variations rather than new virus type
“ New virus only means that this has been a person from abroad.
This is not something that has been working in this country," says Már Kristjánsson, surgeon in the National Hospital Department of Infections, reporting that “new type of virus” has been diagnosed in this country.
Three inland smits were diagnosed yesterday and two at the border.
One who had detected had participated in the social work of a sports society at the Rey Cup Course Congress, but the source of the infection was unfounded and an infection is over.
Infections were also detected in a person who arrived in the country of 15 July and are two who were in contact with him began to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Then, yesterday, infection associated with infection reported in the morning and after a series analysis in the Icelandic genographic analysis, “new type of virus that has not been identified here” was detected.
Infections are completed in the context of this infection.
There is not a new virus, but the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new crown virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more appropriate to speak of new variations of that virus than of a new type of virus.
Ask what it means, and if it may say something about the beginning of another wave of the pastor, Már says that as if there are a single case, it could be done so that nothing more could be done.
“ However, if it occurs inland cases which are not connected from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variation, the conclusion [in the second wave] could be drawn, but it is timely to support it,” explains Már.
The Holy Pot Happy
Is the secret of the happiness of the Israelites hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC organisers will lead to an likelihood of a fun video that gives light to the land's swimming and hot pots.
The Icelandic bathing community is a special worldwide one, and it is claimed that no one in the world is as many bathing places in each inhabitant.
The natural soil is the foundation of it, but also the standard of disadvantage.
Children’s education was legally lawful in 1940, but older citizens are still able to use their hot water to improve their health.
Sundry is described as a fixed part of the country’s general welfare.
In the pot, all of them are equal, independence and position.
As a result of the mobile phones, people are talking personally about the home and the rays or uses of the refining power of water: meditating and loading the batteries of soul and body.
On the Brat to pick up a hundred days at elections
Hundreds of days are until the Americans go to the elections and choose President for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-select, but he's got to pick up the brat.
Joe Biden, the prospective Democrate Group’s Promotion Group, has a great presumption on Trump in the country, taking into account the surveys.
According to a new survey by the AP newspaper, the number of Americans believes that the nation is on the wrong way.
Similarly, Trump’s reactions because of the world’s new crown virus are very unfamiliar, and more Americans consider more than before the president held bad economics.
In particular, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right way.
32 percent say that Trump is supporting the reactions of the epidemic, and 48 percent say he has maintained a good economic activity.
In March, it was 56 percent, and in January 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden accompanys 49.9 percent per country-wide, with Trump 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to move his attention from his standpoint to Biden, to promote so - called cultural disputes, and to preach policies that are to be reversed to law and regulation.
However, the Biden’s presentation is a great effort to keep the attention of Trump and considers the probability of victory if the election is really about how Trump has been working in the past four years.
Trump’s opportunities seem also to come down to the Congress of the Republic, fearing the Democrats that even the majority of the United States’ elders, which has been very proud, could be reached.
Politico told us in the days that they were keeping comparable to classes and a provider, and it is now that the Reputations would be the most deprived for decades.
The Committee of the Regions has been particularly bad in the 2016 sessions and now it looks like that development will continue.
Trump has in recent days attempted to scare people who are alienated to follow him, including by saying that becoming President Biden, he will destroy the United States’ communities and promote racial disputes.
Trump has, among other things, cut down rules from the time of Barack Obama in the White House, which was intended to increase diversity in the surroundings.
Then he urged a home mother, the Americans, to read an article after the former auxiliary director of New York, in which she claimed that Biden would destroy the United States’ communities and took Trump.
“ Your departure and your American dreams will be ruined.
I will keep it, and even make it even better!" said the President.
Inhabitants of the United States are a growing group of voters.
According to NPR, they are about half the voters in the United States.
Since then George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the producing person who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012 when My Romney received the majority of votes from this group but lost for Barack Obama.
The surveys have shown that despite Trump’s assurance of a small majority in 2016, his follow-up has been substantially collapsed.
Although there is a difference between the candles, Biden has been measured with about fifteen percent presets of Trump in the past.
Regis Philbin is dead
The American televisionman Regis Philbin is dead, 88 years old.
Philbin served as actor, a participant, present, and singer for some six decades.
He is one of the best known to manage the popular Live! with Regis in 1988 to 2011 with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
Then he has managed factors like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has been most hours in the U.S. television and has acknowledged it.
He received six Emmy prizes at work and was named 37 times.
A statement from his family shows that Philbin died of natural worries.
A number of fellow workers, friends, and fans have reminded him of social media last day.
Will the Olympic Fire Be Light at the end of the gangs?
After a final decision was taken to delay the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have led to this, the president of the Olympic Committee said that the famous Olympic Fire would be “the light at the end of the gangs, ” and there was a prospect of referring to the world’s crown virus that the world’s inhabited is now going through.
In addition, financial people have a year to prepare themselves, and Japan’s authorities make up their expenses because of their delay.
Everybody, however, keeps a lot of heads on the end.
When it was announced that Tokyo would be the county of the Olympics this year, the joyfulness of Japanese representatives was true.
They were crying and laughing, and Tokyo had sought to keep the games in 2016, but it laughed it down for Rio in Brazil.
This time Tokyo City and Japan were to pray in the world’s attention.
The games were to take place on July 24, to August 9, but they have been delayed for years and started on July 23, 2021 and ends on August 8th.
If the game is not able to keep them, if the crown virus is still too much threatened, the game will be discontinued.
However, no one wants to think about that thinking to the end.
Olimpia games are not a regular sports race.
Nothing is saved, the show should always be wonderful and seeking to play the last games.
The selection of the city for Olympics is based on the opinion of the electoral committee on the presentations of the cities.
The more magnificent the presentation is — the more likely to get the nose.
Tokyo earned $150 million in trying to keep the Olympic Games in 2016, or over $20 billion.
In the second time, when the 2020 game was visited, $75 million, about $10 billion, were put in the presentation.
In 2013, when Tokyo was decided to get the games this year, Japan’s authorities had a total of $30 billion for the project.
Yet, this sum is just a drop in the sea, with regard to the cost of building Olympia villages, stages, and generally strengthening the country’s indoors to manage, prepare, and keep its own games.
Japan’s organizers have said that the Olympics in Tokyo, which had to be in progress in these days but had been delayed for about one year because of the crown virus, would have cost $12,6 billion.
However, in a report from a government reviewer in Japan, which arrived at the end of the last year, it was nearer that the costs were double.
It is likely that the cost of delaying the games cannot be fully evaluated, but it has been estimated that it can cost between two and six billion dollars to add to the initial cost.
Thus, the total cost for the Japanese Olympia Committee and Japanese taxpayers could run between $15 and $30 billion.
There are so high numbers that all the taxpayers of the Icelandic State only did for nearly half Olympics, compared to the lowest possible cost.
Obesity is an event of the scale that they have often become the subject of economics, who try to review numbers and consider the benefits and benefits of the games.
In some cases, it seems that many have concluded that the effects of the Olympics are less positive than the economics of the citizens who hold them.
For example, some of the effects of the dose are very much to a short period of work, but for a longer time, cities are often set up with debts and threatening costs of smallly used workers.
Rio, Brazil, has had serious debts because of the 2016 games and has been in trouble with the cost of maintenance of all the major sports players built for the games.
In London 2012, figures have been reported that only 10 percent of those who received work related to the Olympics in the city had been unemployed before.
This means that it was not a new job but a little.
In general, cities have not been particularly well founded in the economic preservation of the unity due to the cost of the work of the game.
However, the benefits are commonly considered to be included in the increase in travelers who want to visit the Olympic cities following the games, which are very uncertain about the games of 2021.
Also, it is uncertain whether to accept all the number of audiences that are usually attending the games.
However, the phenomenon of the cities is the primary one, but it is hard to appreciate for money.
In spite of enormous costs, the joy that the games bring is not the nature that it can be valued.
Of course, although the show is often awesome and no savings are available, it is not just about money.
There are the sports heroes in the forefront.
For some effective people, it is surprising to delay the games.
For example, the Australian five - year - old woman and a gold - prize seaman in her article on the Chloe Esposito - side of the Olympic Games, who had been casual and had been far from a good fun in summer but hoped to be in a race for the 2021 games.
It is, therefore, among those athletes who are just rather pleased with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were going to quit this year, they had been held at the right time, in some cases the breakdown of the games means that they quit competition before the games take place.
Just don’t trust your body to go through a year further by strict exercises.
Few athletes were as thorough in the hearts of the Olympic Games in Río 2016 and Simone Biles, a ficial star.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has recently met in a few interviews in their home country of the United States to discuss the Olympic Games.
She's going to play the 2021 games, but she's not sure that she's still on the top of the games next year, and then she's 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered a high age, it is higher for a feminist woman in the first order.
“This is a sensitive matter,” says Biles, but smiles to another interview published on the Instagram Committee’s Instagram page, asking whether she is going to reach the 2021 games as long as she did in Rio 2016.
“ I just don’t know if I’m still on the top of a year after another exercise, ” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body does not endure the pressures of physical training much longer.
Yet, she is practicing for the Olympic Games in 2021.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to suddenly stop exercising when the world’s horror stood at the top and the gym was closed.
There were no excesses for Biles rather than others while all athletes were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic Gold couldn't buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to keep in shape like others.
Surely, the basic form is much better than most people.
“ We have a rigid plan now.
It was difficult to begin to practice once the gym was opened.
We started slowly, but we have come back to the full stage, and I will increase the exercises constantly according to what is happening in the year.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be, or whether they will be held, but we are still exercising, despite their beings, nothing else can be done.
I've been spending too much on myself to leave the sport now," says Biles.
With it, like others, there is doubt, or perhaps rather awareness that the situations may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
Yet, predicting that is hopeless.
No one can know how the status of the crown virus will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do than preparing for the Olympic Games for a year.
Maybe the Olympic Fire will be the light at the end of the Covid gates.
Deferred Marriage Due to Pregnancy
The modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to delay her wedding because of the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry the former Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about accurate now,” said the actress in conversation with People.
“ We certainly want to marry and have the dream bridegroom, and we want to have all the attendants who love us.
But we decided to strike it and focus on what is important today, and we are helping to share information about the importance of being masked and staying at home.
I'm looking more at world matters than wedding these days.
There's a lot going on and we should focus our attention on what's happening in the world."
