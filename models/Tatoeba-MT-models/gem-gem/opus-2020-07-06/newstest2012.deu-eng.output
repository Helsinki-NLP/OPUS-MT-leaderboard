No liberating novels for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused the application to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned in a novelle of the criminal law.
The new system that could have set the way to liberate the detained Prime Minister rejected the Members in the second reading of the request for relief of the penalties for economic defects.
Timoshenko had in October been sentenced to seven years in prison because of the conclusion of a supposedly disadvantaged contract with Russia.
The judgment is not yet legally effective, and in December the appeal of the judges is to be negotiated before the court.
Timoshenko himself describes the judgment as a political revenge of the regime and also in the West the process brought the suspicion of the court's predecessorship.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was sentenced to remove from the criminal law, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for his adoption.
Libyan Victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows her losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to be defined.
As usual in this region, victory in the elections of Islamists, the question is only what - the decent or the radical.
The National Transitional Council acknowledged the habitual law of the Scharīαa, which is now a certain idea with God.
Libyen would go to the country without crime, because for theft, you will shortly hack your hand off.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, any descendants of faith are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be united by the Koran from each other’s tribes.
Shortly - in Libya, there will be a order that would be hard to imagine and, above all, not desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not even the only and objectively seen is probably not the best and would hardly fit the liberians mentioned.
So it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were at all helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To her apologize, it is likely that only the fact that the air attacks of NATO were not led by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose almighty was praised after every successful hit.
The winner in Libya?
We only participated in a gun change, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians dissolved themselves in the person of a political dictator without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we prefered to look away from a military occupyment of Libya.
This makes the hues anxiety – that is, the dispersion of the cruise drivers.
But do the mineral oil companies also get the black gold at the spot price without occupation?
It is hardly possible for the West to end with the right of its selflessness to protect human rights.
If they do not destroy the Sharīa representatives.
Start of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe focused on investors.
On Tuesday a statistical storm depth broke through Europe.
The individual States published their information on their GDP for the 3rd quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the prequartal, Germany and France.
However, today, the obligation market rip all records.
The investors are not only looking at Greece but now also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Europe Zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisional forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, which was 0.4% of France.
At the same time, both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded a higher growth than was originally expected (a growth by 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France granted a slightly decrease of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, the gross domestic product stagnated and according to Tsch. The Statistical Office confirmed the trend of growth slowing down economic performance.
So the results are worse than the forecasts of the analyticals.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 per cent in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, however compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy increased by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
In the euro area and in the EU, between July and September, the economy recorded a growth of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to the expectations of analyticians.
The Greek economy shrinked by 5.2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The remuneration from its 10-year government loans increased the value of 28,45%.
The profits of Italian and Spanish government loans rose up to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries also start to feel problems...
The remuneration in Czech state loans remains less than 4%, even if the situation in the region is worsening.
In Germany, votes will be loud that the ECB should be the creditor of the last instance.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-decorated Torwart Čech and a wonderful gate of Petr Jiráček, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, the Czech football could thus defend its luxurious precursor from home game and will once again not miss at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the ascending game in a detailed reporting.
Low excitement in the first half-time and a giant proportion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won very happy 1:0 thanks to the complete weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro, and thus launched its ticket for the football-EM.
Also, because of the precise defense game of the Czech team, they put the Montenegriners under pressure only in the second half of the period.
The birds of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, which shot two giant chances.
Thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will also be mixed with the European championships next year, and it is also happy that the domestic football will offer a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minutes, quite fighting football was played.
Both teams combined slowly, and so was played mainly around the middle line.
Also during the second half of the period, the pressure of the home team remained out, and the large offences before the punishment room were successfully defended by the Czech Defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for the core programme of their country.
They made a living shield.
Some hundred university students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the core program of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed on Tuesday afternoon before the object and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students at the University of Iranian Isfahan formed a living sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where Uran is processed on Tuesday.
They wanted to make known that they were willing to protect the core program of their country, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently noted in its report that Iran had seemed to have not abandoned anything after his efforts to create a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, there is a possible attack on Iranian core plants.
Students had prayed to the complex in the afternoon before the entrance and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attack carried out by the intention of placing the Iranian nuclear programme mostly lazy, the Israeli press said from the centre of Isfahan would also be the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan's attack target.
The food map of a fatty child: it doesn't eat breakfast and eat to the evening bread worst
More than one third of the children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children overweight.
Current surveys have shown - adipous children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
This again shows how important the environment is for the healthy development of a human, in which he grows up and is the examples that surround him.
On the tables of adipous children, worst products are up to half more often on the table than in families where normally weighted children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had on the morning of the information action under the motto "Adipositas is not a coincidence" pommes for evening bread.
In families with Dickerchen, sports also does not belong to the favorite jobs, but also to the majority of today's students - only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
Surveillance under 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, and nearly 900 children from primary schools were consulted throughout the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the action "Adipositas is not a coincidence" supported by the General Krankenkasse and the Unilever Society.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 classes participated in the project.
Unhealthy cost and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors responsible for the horrible increase in the number of children with overweight or even fatse.
"For example, only half of the children asked to eat five times a day, in breakfast-second breakfast-second lunch-Vesper evening bread - one of the main requirements for healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for evening bread
Experts point out that relative minorities, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are also important for the healthy development of a child.
In Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the students' families are breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone is having breakfast for himself.
The worst was the finding that is not at all frozen in every tenth family.
Breakfast is considered as a basic stone of healthy daily diet.
The survey test revealed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children are consumed much more frequently unhealthy poems.
And almost everyone - without consideration for weight - drinks sweet limonades every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children in question are sporting, only less than half of their parents do that - only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile their own food plan from the possibilities offered by appetite.
"What Czech children prefer in puncto diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many meal foods, meat dishes, and of course sweet foods.
"Alarming is primarily the great popularity of sweet Limonaden," is stressed in the final report on this survey.
During lunch, i.e. the main court, the deeds were defeated nearly before poultry.
The children almost didn't like hillfruits, and the popularity of fish and vegetables as lunches was very small.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are very willing to change their eating habits when they get the right information.
"In the control group of the questionnaires who filled the questionnaire after the clarification of the presentation "Adipositas is not a coincidence", the results of the project are mentioned in many cases as a significant shift in preferences to principles of healthy diet."
Evidently, for example, this was at the sweet limos, where many children began to give normal water priority.
In the questionnaire, the children also crossed much more often poultry or fish as the main court of the day and were ready to eat less nuts or sweet foods.
Proclaim Profis - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had somewhat melted that this was a bit too much material for the beginning.
I didn't know anything else.
lectures of three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on-the-spot" runs.
It's supposed to be worse.
The closer the test comes to the more information and practical tasks we are facing.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we discussed with Director Alena (not taking part in the course) how to dress a woman who has no ideally proportionate figure.
And that's most of us.
The one has one too short neck, the others one too young figure without regular curves and again others are molly.
It's a matter of the stylist to chew wide shoulders optically, extend the neck or embrace the necessary curves.
We also got tips about how to dress a woman like Jennifer Lopez - with large buses, wide hips and narrow tailles - beautiful and figure - without too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between tailles and hips is so large that the rock or hook really does not fit, you should at least be cut one piece by measure.
You will certainly not regret that because good seating clothing is simply unpaid.
In such a tailored rock you feel much better than in one of the stairs, which always is too high and scratched, in which the tailles stand, etc.
Youthful figures can again allow you to wear clothing with folds, bouquets, applications, sticking or raping.
At this amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have a whole week of time to let everything go thoroughly through my head.
And yet I'm afraid it's almost impossible to do it in the light of the house assignment.
Each of the participants received a promi, for which she is supposed to think outfits – day-to-day clothing and evening robe.
We should take into account the current appearance, fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "dress Miranda Kerr" which you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
In my heart I rejoice, because this is much better for me than to dress for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has probably increased to the hundred kilos (though well, it is a bit overdriven), or the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the clothing out of magazines or search on the Internet, print and then graphically edit.
In the "motherboard", as the whole result is mentioned, we will then express our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
Because it is very important to think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist is not only attractive to the models physically, but also designed the so-called product page in the journals (as specific, e.g. trend handbags, mantels, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about this.
But it's only Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday presentation, filled with information about figure types, was equally sprayed by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, by the fashion creator Jakub Polanka and by the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion illusion is and that a stylist should be able to use this.
And one-led stylist can work with a single clothing piece in a very different way.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trenchcoat as usual over the Jeans, that is, like a T-shirt or mantle, but you can also wear it on the naked body, dress it and wear it as a dress.
It's enough to climb up the armel or the crown and then the whole look look is quite different.
"Played with it," he stressed.
But most of the advice was given to me: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"First you can hurt them," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we need to pauch all these teachings, what can be combined with what, and why, even if you often get to see in fashion journals, it is quite different.
Quiet from fashion views.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he finally photographs.
So you must be prepared for a Fashion Story with ten pages (speaking ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo, in combination with other accessories, sometimes looks quite different than in reality.
So all of this must be expected in the design of the outfits.
That image and style sometimes constitute half of success, which also confirmed us Jan Pokorný.
There you just need Madonna to look at a not just brilliant singer from the image and marketing made a world star.
In Czech Republic you are more reserved to the services of a stylist.
Also known personalities often believe that this is a thrown money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look out for it is second-range).
And if someone is able to stylish from us, we should expect that he or she will force us with great probability to have a very different (slighter) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to be sure that the boulevard press writes that has the appropriate promi back or off, etc.
On Sunday, Jan and Mario asked us not to believe that a stylist just focused on the fashion and then "to build together" the outfit.
In his work, he must communicate mainly with the people he styles, and he must be a soft psychologist.
Appreciating people without offering themselves and standing to his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to see her clothing cabinet and to supplement nice pieces, we can't clear her all of the cabinet and tell her - my God, that's really terrible."
"You must at least find a few commendable things to which you recommend what you can carry on with it," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what a so-called "plastic bag" must include.
So this is a pocket that you get on the trunk and in which you carry all the necessary proprietaries.
Besides such clear things, such as screws, screws for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (this helps the stylist to photograph products such as towels or cabinets), special clips with which the clothing is ripped back if it is too large (tracknails or other sticks are prohibited so that the substance can't be broken) and natural nuts.
However, in order not only to listen but also to try something practical, we learned how to put shoes right down.
Also, when photographing in the atelier where the floor is just, you can damage the shoeshole, sweep it outside.
We climbed and climbed...
You should not even touch the shoes with the shear, so that you can't damage them.
So you have to do really skillful.
Mario rejoiced me by praiseing my "creation" without limitations.
The skills mentioned are not exactly my strength.
All of this was only the fraction of what we got to hear at the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - dedicated to styling at a professional level, is not a child game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original careless ride will be completely avoidable, dilettant errors in the route to the early history.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambititions largely, what helps it if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Already before he came to the store tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
He promised to move the already-old game series "Nod for Speed" again to a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he did not seem to be just one of many action race games.
We were also curious about the passages in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues to walk.
But as you have been used to NFS, the end effect is much different than you had expected.
Secure - potentially it is quite decent Arcade races, but the game is totally smuggled by some excessive errors that have been present for a few years in this series for more or less.
So there are no more mistakes, but rather signs of an incomprehensible foolishness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
The first time you are introduced into the history, whose main figure Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, so on the West Coast, you are at the Lenkrad - with the task of becoming the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole range of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty single races.
This means that each race is carried out on another route and that the individual stages are taking place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have a moment the impression that game would always offer the same.
Some surroundings are still very nice to see this, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So there's nothing in the world.
But the journey through the desert, through a herbish landscape or upwards through deeply cut landscape seemed very pleasant.
Up and again brings untypical elements a little variation into the individual races.
For example, in the desert you are surprised by a desert storm that strongly limits the sight.
In the mountains again, you need to watch that you are not shaken by a lawn.
Besides, the individual races are very well built in each other.
It's just a few, but they're enough.
For a while you are trying to overcome the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to retrieve (classic race against the stop clock), then you expect another personal duell with one contradictor.
And to do this, the police are still interfering, who wants to make the whole thing to you.
A news is passports in which Jack leaves the car.
It's rather about some interactive animations in which Jack is flying from someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that in the game there is much less such passages than you would expect (probably only three).
Finally, this is more advantageous, because this element has at least no chance to bore - it belongs to the above mentioned elements that make the game more varied.
The model runs in the footsteps of the preceding parts.
That means, from today's point of view, although it does not rip out trees, on the other hand, it could not be said that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look around elsewhere.
But an action-loaded race will continue to be very well justified by the housely driving model, even though you can find better in competition.
Until then everything is in the best order.
Real problems come up only after some time.
Unlike the model, the collision model is not entirely O.K.
Of a game of this kind, it is hard to expect to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no impact on any object knowing how the car is going, then obviously it's not all right.
Typical example: When fast pick-up or prepayer to hiting cars, the other cars are "stripped" in some places only easy, in other, nearly identical situations, but you get into the sleeves and turn wild piroutes.
Or the car is going to scratch.
Thanks to the restarting system, this doesn't matter any more, it's all the time angry.
The restarts are solved as follows: if you have total damage or land far away from the route, then you throw the game back to the last point of the route.
Only - in every race you have only five restarts.
If you've exhausted it, everything's going on from the front.
The restarts are, therefore, more like a tool, in case something fails to succeed, but you should rather not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the restart doesn't even help, there's nothing else that helps to learn the critical section out of the head.
Especially unpleasant is that the same things happen often at the same places.
For example, some curves need to go through in a very specific way, otherwise you simply don't fit.
Otherwise, you always meet "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you come as the first or fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later.
This is especially angry in situations when one sees that the contradictor gets past a playing on two matching cars, but until you arrive there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive or brake them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, because everything is so designed that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The Contractors have further advantages.
There are a few places throughout the game where you are always retrieved at the same place by the same opponent and also here without consideration of the time.
In the confusing test, this is to finish the game on the long bridge that is happening in opposite direction.
The Contractor must obviously get you out of here on the devil.
And if he's before one, he'll naturally take a look, so you'll start driving your own car in Klump a few times.
Of course - you want to make the game more exciting and exciting but this intent is so clear that it quickly remembers the joy of the game.
And that's bad, because despite a simpler driving model, the game as a whole is quite entertaining and in a position also loaded so that you don't know where one's head is.
And in principle, what is "guilty" about it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of races in a way that no boring can arise, or something quite different...
A unusual idea is also the car change during the race.
You should not overlook the tank stations on the route, because right here you can switch the car, although in most cases the car you have is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight motorways and exotic super sports cars for technical rides, for example on the Serpents in the mountains.
Hand-hand in hand with the mode of the play history also goes the task mode (demands) - i.e. the races in the individual locations you know from the history.
There are not only medals here, but also experience points for your own profile, which are shared for the tasks (heart challenges) and history.
In order to reach a higher driver level, various items must be locked up: starting from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected to the online function Autolog, which compares, among other things, the own results achieved with those of other players and also ensures additional collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible cutters is a situation in the last race of history.
This is where you get the car into an U-Bahn tunnel (mileway), where you rest in the dark on the rails (mileway).
On the tacho, figures look between 150 a 200 km/h (military road), but there comes once from the back of a subway and drives a compromiseless to scrap.
In our editorial we'll probably be fighting for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we're so stupid.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases quite appealing and even brilliant here and there.
The more irritable is that in some exciting moments, the refreshment rate is slowing down and sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this concerns, in particular, the accidents with a larger number of stakeholders, where a continuous FPS does not benefit anyway.
The sound playback is to the extent O.K. and the sound track is tasteful.
In endeavoring to address as wide as possible a scale rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lay "of everyone something" - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game wouldn't be bruised by the total unnecessary errors mentioned, we could have claimed with the breasttone that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems somewhat unfinished.
For yourself a class of pleasure, but you should be prepared to put these mistakes into your eyes with the power of airport licensers.
Concert of the "Students of the Human Revolution" with Songsembles of the Karlsuniversity
The Festival Festival Academica now offers for the third time the refreshment of the World Student Day with the anniversary of the Seed Revolution and this as well as music experience.
In the course of the festival, the twenty professional and academic chores are present.
The focus of the festival is the two concerts held on 17 November.
"The Karlsuniversity has a large share in the festival."
"The choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanist Studies is also represented among the participants, and the rector Václav Hampl also sits at the Festival Fund," said Jakub Čaloun, head of the Organization Team.
Absolute highlight of the Festival is the public concert of professional school hearing, which takes place on 17 November from 14 o'clock on the place before the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
The program is the composition of the important Czech Jazzer Karel Ržička "Celebration Jazz Mass".

EU Messenger Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativeists and euroskippers
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the individual institutions feelable from the lot."
I wouldn't have expected such a harsh war to burn out."
"It will take five-six years until the waves are bleeding and all have been used to their new role," began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador at the European Union, quite sharpening her lecture at the Legal Faculty.
How serious she takes the motto "Intelligent and open about Europe", she already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a transparent and understandable way that it could have denyed so many teachers of the Karlsuniversity's Legal Faculty.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new Permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning criticism became loud that he was too obsessive - a grey official who had not grown such a role, but I must say that it has defeated all the breath of how well he accepted the matter.
"He is a person who makes it clear to listen patiently to seven and twenty Member States, to communicate with them and, above all, to have clear ideas about how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy explained then as an answer to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call?", that is, as an important step towards the agreement and better reading of EU policies to countries, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us our oil moisture quarrel
Mrs Vicenová also dedicated itself to the agenda that the European Union was living and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency of two years ago called her success.
The Czechs would have tackled the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organized the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The case of the government during the presidency referred to it as a great negative, which had seriously harmed the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has all hands to do full.
With the words of the Ambassador, it was not only the presidency but also the subsequent crisis that has not been overcome until today.
And there is still a need to approve the EU's seven-year budget, which makes it much more complicated because of the current economic situation.
Whether it will be a slim and sparable budget, which sectors will be given priority, which countries are more and less supported - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also reminds of her own slogans, with whom she came to Brussels: "Intelligent about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, then there are greedy shortcuts, foreign words, and expertjargons that no one understands.
As a citizen, how should I actually know whether you really crumple or round cubes and different large bananas in Brussels or whether someone really wants to ban us the quarrel?
It would also like to use the ground of the EU to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU messenger, the Czechs are calling for euroshiprs to be more perceived the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is much more angry.
Many factors are guilty of this, including the retention of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and not least the weak support of the Czech side.
Apart from the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, so-called V4.
"Do you believe me when a pole or ungar comes to me and a Slovakia is nearby, then the French next to me says, "Hey, what are you holding your heads together - is it again your V4?" and thereby makes a pretty acid Miene.
According to Mrs Vicenové, in the future, the EU expects hard rules for the Member States' budget policy.
As much more real than a "European Federation" it views the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the euro area and the countries beyond the euro area.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
"The first time was said that only the countries who want to work together and those who do not want it should stand quietly away."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will eventually lead to a strong "Europe of the various speeds", expects Mrs Vicenová.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the topics of impact on the EU must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand Story:
The Innovator IBM comes into the second century of his existence
If you wanted to search for a suitable word that the IBM strategy characterizes the exactest, then this would probably be the word "Langitude".
For the broad public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although it has been over a century since its founding.
The basis for this long-term life was already put to her first boss - visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Already he represented the slogan, countless global problems could easily be solved if people were ready to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became a trademark to play the life of the future gigant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was already started to be released at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis for the thoroughly prepared company culture.
"For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful for a whole century because it remained faithful and did not fear to change everything else around.
This allowed us to transform the technologies, business and society throughout the first century.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company from the occasion of the anniversary.
Thinking system
Whatson operated in the thirty years of social care of his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Baęa in Czechoslovakia: the IBM members had paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as a work clothing and a thorough remuneration system for best newer and traders.
Similarly, IBM's long-term relations with its customers are also excluded.
The company has been genial in talent promotion from the beginning - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM has raised any discrimination - and has thus been able to choose.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan is changed to the top of IBM next year by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
It has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she took the position of the Head of Vehicles, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been making so-called online brownstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations grow.
No wonder - ideas are enough, the company is almost half a million people busy.
An institution with a good reputation
Their inevitable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this to the inside and to the outside.
"From the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said the Economist professor of the Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony of Consulting-Firma Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be present on the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logos for family "Big Blue", has grown to one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies IBM has most patents and already five of his employees have been awarded the Nobel Prize.
Its most well-known inventions include banking machines, credit cards, financial swap, strike code or the floppy.
With about $220 billion stock value (market capitalisation) this year, IBM was the second largest technology company (even after Apple), with the first overtake of Microsoft since 1996.
Forelooking
Not all products and innovations met today's customers' taste - unfortunately, for example, were the attempt with their own OS/2 operating system, the online service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you should not be emotionally bound to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem building its base walls on different platforms - and if they do not work, leave them again.
Unlike the counterplayer Microsoft, who in principle stands and falls with his operating system Windows.
Success-promising technologies
The profits of IBM are largely involved in services, software and hardware.
In 1990, hardware was still the strongest represented with a more than fifty percent share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profitable assets worth $15 billion, but in the same time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-dependent technologies.
In these investments IBM continues after 2008 when the modern financial crisis fought the world for the first time as a storm.
Also here, IBM remained faithful to the power of his first chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment volume in the middle of the major world economy crisis.
Until now it seems that the company IBM is without prejudice to today's crisis.
The value of the IBM shares has increased by 120 percent since 2008, and the company's pure profit has grown continently.
The company log of IBM is: everything can be changed - only the values are not.
That is why this flexible gigant can also be expected to master the next crisis.
IBM History: From Käss Schneider to World General Flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded in New York a hundred years ago, initially had a very complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took her first in 1924 - originally a brand name for a establishment in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later company IBM laid the merger of four companies whose history is back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They owned technologies, such as the famous stamp card clocks to register the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who was also chaired by the Supervisory Board by 1930.
And it was Flint who appointed the manager of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him with the company's management.
This leader even put the founders of IBM in the shadow - based on Watson's ideas up to today, the inconsiderable culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name already tells, began with the production and distribution of all possible machines for trade - from worst and cheese cuttings, to boxes.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he was sitting in the headsets for 40 years, only then he was dissolved by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its leadership IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM of NASA's flights helped engineers and computers lead to all - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to moon.
In the meantime, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the series IBM System/360.
A classic PC, which determined the computer standard of that time, came to the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it purchased the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully increased into the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It represents the intention of using technologies wisely in areas that have not yet been planned, such as improving the situation in transport and urban administration.
In the commercial sector IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in Czech Republic.
Since 1932, IBM founded a foundation in the Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and there is also a top research team of world level that deals with the technology of voting recognition.
Darina Rychtářová over her unfaithful husbands:
Iveta - you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtář (53) became a lover of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his rosen dream and come home.
But now it's finally over with patience and for the further life it has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová had offered refuge to singer I. Bartošová in her own house, she wouldn't even have fallen into the dream of her husband.
And when Iveta went back to their forces after 30 days, and went back to Žíčany, Joseph went right away.
Yes, he even confessed publicly that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, even it seemed as if she wanted to reconcile herself with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the passport.
Rychytář doesn't matter who is sleeping with his wife
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, I will not drive him out."
"Not at all as a loved, lost old ass, but as a man to whom I still have certain bonds," said Mrs. Rychtářová; but she also said that she has already separated emotionally from him and is solely on mutual adherence.
The fact that Darina locked the back door to him, Joseph has been with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I stay with Iveta, there's nothing going to change."
"My wife wants a paper-ee and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I buy."
"With Darina I am quite normal, only the bed we just don't share," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to stop them.
"We don't sleep with each other, so I don't care if she has a friend or who it is.
I understand that this is my fault, I've been in love with Iveta and therefore I take over any responsibility.
The worst female male, what about you?
If you invite the men to call some typical female disguises, then they shake a few out of the army without exception.
Love women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we'll let a few unsitten revue happen again that let the men wall the blood into the eagles?
Purchasing application
Does their husband suggest that they be purchasing?
Do you have to buy at least one hatre a week?
Do you like to shop and may it be a little more for actions?
Then it's probably a weakness in your case.
Some women are at least aware of it and try to keep their purchasing desire under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman is already able to try in the cabin on the search for a well sitting upper clothing just by a clothing business and not like all (in all possible color combinations)?
Although shopping for most women is a hobby, for the men it is often the pure hell.
Think of how often they said to her husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Permanent dissatisfaction
"Isn't I too thick?"
"I have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or gymnastics?"
"Do I like you at all?"
Does this seem known to them?
Yeah?
Then you may also be among the women who are regularly possessed of how they look.
This does not mean that you should be allowed to go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife constantly embarrasssses on her appearance.
The stronger sex is unanimous - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly impatient.
Order and cleanliness at first
It's a fight against windmills.
Put windows, wipe tiles and dust, screw the whale - and this at least twice a week.
Squeak with her partner because he once again tramples with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, you screwed the children because the just screwed wash basket is already drunk again and because the glass door at the living room cabinet has already got fingerprints again, but where the polering makes so much effort?
If you are suffering under this kind of "deviance", you should know that nothing is to be excessive and the order and cleanness of family life is not the first place.
This measuring purity bird can eventually also harm the mutual relations and especially the rest of the family.
Tiles
"Smart tournaments come into the wash basket."
"Do you really want to dress the old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel isn't just throwing on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don't wonder that it brings it to the palm.
Of course, that's not bad. They just want to have all his order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not have had to mecker so much.
Clazy and Tratsch
Some women climbing and walking out, get twisted or even slopped behind the back, or they smear bonds.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to cheer through such topics, such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a little harmless chat and tratch in stock.
Hand on the heart - that's probably all women owned.
However, this is not to be confused with cladistants the greatest calibers, who are nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their surroundings and which are a major danger for women's collections.
Jágr and Voráček help Philadelphia with their assistants to victory
The Eishockeystorm Jaromír Jágr had a large share of the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina at the NHL's Monday game and is thus the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
Using the overview of the nine and thirty-year-old Eishockeystar was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added another assistant and was called for the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's composer Jakub Voráček.
Jagr claimed to be a journalist after the game, he prophesied Giroux a great evening.
"Sonly before the game, I tell him that he's doing a hattrick today."
I had that kind of in my feeling."
"Hin and again overcome such a feeling," Jágr explained, after his action Giroux reached a gate at the first shot of the Flyers.
A little later, the second match also had "a Czech track".
Voráček fighted the Puck behind the gate of the Hurricanes and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer made a short trader, but the second third then belonged to the Flyers again.
Concrete Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr, he reached his third hit, and then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth gate.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say that he's the best player of the League, but surely he belongs to the best three," Jágr appreciated his center.
"I wouldn't have noticed in my life that I would play with such a icockey player as with him to finish my career."
"I'm so happy."
"I'm cutting my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL my companions put their game on me and now the spider turns around," Jagr swallowed.
Carolina still made the game the drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and again Dwyer, who was experiencing a criminal shot, it came to a gate.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was in excess two successful against one.
"Excellently, pronger was still acting in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) moved to remote posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked," prescribed Voráček the last match of the party from his viewpoint.
By this victory, Philadelphia sat at the top of the eastern conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured himself in the game against Buffalo and ended in the second third because of a damage to the upper body.
Beck also experienced their leadership in the Penalty shoots 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec couldn't change one of the criminal funds.
More than the lost points, the trainer of the home team probably hurt the high disease-related defensive loss - the game they played only with five defenders.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the meeting with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing to do, we have to get done," said Jacques Martin.
"In every change a wave of attack after the other, and we had nothing against it."
"We had to make the game easier and bring the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defendants.
Ondřej Pavelec, the Czech gatekeeper ondřej Pavelec conceived thirty shots from Tampa Bay and thus contributed to 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
The gates of the Jets, which ended a series of five defeats, shared five different protectors.
Development of travel prices since 1989
By 1989 there were only five authorised public travel offices in ČSSR: Čedok, sportsurist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
The travel offices then sold only travels to the socialist eastern block countries, and only those in the West were allowed to elect.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the East Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), to the Soviet Union (Soji on the Peninsula Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania on the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when traveling to Yugoslavia was allowed, then Yugoslavia joined a pro-west course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the East Block (also the Czechoslovakians) to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise, individual travel was not possible.
The travel offices also offered travels in the West, but then they had to buy huge snakes or also stay in the sleep bag before the travel office, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel office.
This has not been the case for a long time.
The so-called exchange promise - the condition for a trip to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to drive the necessary financial resources (west currency) for a journey to the west.
Thus, most Czechs spent their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs bought numerous weekend houses and dates - a habit that lasts until today.
The total revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czech Republic on foot.
During a vacation in the DDR or Bulgaria, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which is no longer aware of today, is the fact that in the most popular country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989, it was part of Yugoslavia.
Just from the beginning of the 1990s of the last century, the obligation to exchange has been lifted into the neighbouring Western European countries, resulting in a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians couldn't get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
Thus the Czech holidays slept on travel to Paris in the tent in the park, because who had already had the money for a accommodation in the hotel or in a pension at that time.
A typical feature of foreign travel from Czech Republic was then a full-packed baggage room with conserves, beer and permanent worst, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our level of life and thus also the average salaries increased, which in 1997 reduced to another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demands for travel, the travel offices began regularly to prepare trips by charter flights after 1997, making it incredibly acceptable to the flights thanks to the possibility of dealing with quantity discounts compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already devised payment traffic with all highly developed countries in the world, making it easier to travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-all" travel came in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was completed to Thailand thanks to the high demand.
Since then, every year direct charter flights with Czech passengers are flying in far away sunny countries; this year, 12 exotic destinations are directed from Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the era, which marked our "postrevolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States suspended the visa obligation for Czech tourists, thus definitely ranking our country among the highly developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their vacation in abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head for a single vacation stay, including the cost of the holiday place.
The General Assembly will find a new chairman - again threatens a patt.
For almost five months, the Czech football has not been a chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek will not be known at the top of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after the extraordinary General Meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
Until today, there is no agreement on which elections should be chosen.
And without this there is no vote on the three potential successors possible.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June Hašek resigned from his function, inviting his colleagues to agree and find a strong personality that can lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era to Hašek, the old querels broke out again between the two association chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear on 16 September when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People's House in the Prague Quarter Smíchov, because the negotiation had not resulted in any result and it was not just the choice itself.
Because it was not even possible to agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or even the functioners equipped with a power.
On this only point, at least partial agreement was reached, which also contributed to the recommendation of the Institute for State and Legal Affairs, whose views were not held on a voluntary basis.
However, the disputes concerning the election order remain.
The Executive Committee also did not clarify the matter at which meetings, whether normal or extraordinary, are in principle nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the opinions on elections changed a few times - the neuralgical point remained the same.
The question is: how should we take action in the third round to avoid a patt situation?
"The dispute concerns whether to act in accordance with the statute or whether a completely different model needs to be found," Dušan Soboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the FAČR, who represents the professional football in the management.
According to a statutory model, in the third round the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he candidizes.
Marathing is supposed to be ready to come to the compromise that the candidate wins the higher number of votes from both chambers.
In turn, the Czech side is on the condition that the winner receives at least one second-third majority at this percentage of votes.
"Then the two rounds have no sense at all, this mode would question the whole two chamber concept," soboda understands the objections of the maurian side, which best find it not to add the order of election, but to choose according to a valid statute.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even if it appears that the statutory election order of all candidates is most likely to meet Pelta.
"My wish is that most of the choice is made after the statute."
"So there are no unwise replacement variants, such as at the last main meeting," explained the owner (the football club) Victoria Plzeě, who for the first time candidated and limited himself to Pelta in his opinions, especially in the case of Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
He believes that the new Chairman will be known in Nymburk, and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for football-EM on today would certainly contribute to calming the moods."
"If the football runs on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says Jablonec's functioner, who brings the greatest experience of all three adapts, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl's more restrained there.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately twinty."
"This is not a matter between the people of trees and marathons, but there are some efforts to "justify" the rules for their own purposes."
"This is why a re-blocking at the General Assembly is not excluded."
"I hope, however, that the healthy sense of human beings will end up," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to agree with all sides no longer.
Some negotiations are supposed to be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generity will be completely complete until the qualification game.
The charter aircraft, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not be started in Prague in the morning because of a technical disturbance, so they were fiercely looking for a replacement variant, as to bring a part of the executive committee to the location of the Barrage hint.
Finally, the meeting at Minister's level, which is supposed to be held on Wednesday, is decisive.
Joseph Dobeš, Minister for School, Youth and Body Education, would like to move the split parties within the largest sports association of the country to an agreement.
It's a lot on the spel: State aids, the confidentiality of the Czech football and also the coming General Assembly of ČSTV, which should show the Czech sport the new direction for the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes in the fight for the position of the chairman because he does not see any suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the chief of Pilsner Footballers, could have been a strong candidate before the extraordinary General Assembly, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new Chairman of the Association of Footballs of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have joined the fight for this top position.
"If there was a good attorney, I would fight for him and quit the election."
"But in the present situation it was not possible to find such an adapt," said Paclík ČTK.
So the main reason for Paclík to go to Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the supposed favorites of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that in the case of his victory he intends to exercise the President's function only one year, that is, until 2013, until the date of the regular General Assembly.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see a experienced top manager who is not too much attached to football events.
"I have spoken personally with some people in question."
"Please believe that some said to me they didn't want to identify themselves with the Czech football.
"Such views would have changed," he suggested.
Most of all, Paclík claims to interfere with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation that is considered behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegate votes on main meetings.
It is therefore unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta had the position of the chairman.
"In his victory, today's state would be conserved, and in the Czech football it wasn't going forward at all."
"The support by Berbr, a smart businessman, confronts the football twice bad," stressed Paclík.
It also suggests that Pelta's name fell in a corruption saffaire some time ago, in connection with telephone hearings, but from the Pelta was punished.
"I don't know what Prestige should bring a victory of Pelta to the football."
"And how would we stand there in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, his former expression, "he will sell the Pilsner football club when Pelta become Chairman", but sees something more loose.
However, if Paclík wins in the Thursday election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, who had supported Paclík before the General Assembly in October, who ended with a fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him, for example, as Head of the National Team."
"But I don't think he can lead the association as a manager."
"I don't put my nose in matters of which I don't understand," said Paclík, who in September saw that he stood at the top of the Damková, after the appointment of the arbitrary commission, with Luěk Macela, the Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels the role of the association chairman grown.
And calls on his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also head of Pilsen, who celebrate the first triumph in the League with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interested groups who tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committees, which is in opposition situations, Paclík, who does not make a heal from his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta Captain Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he sees the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with which he would lobby with the political top politicians for more money flowing from the lottery tax into sports.
"This is one of the crucial things the new chairman should devote himself to."
"If it comes to taxing gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but then they also have to say clearly where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Club does not regard Paclík as a personicap, although he himself stresses, the Chairman of the FAČR must be "expartial".
Pelta, again, is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"It's not just ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person to return after another half years," Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will expose a patt situation in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chairman's Office, Miroslav Pelta, he would be stronger in the event of his election for the FAČR to receive a new statute, which in the future excludes disputes about the election order.
The functioner from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes that the election struggle will be safely resolved in a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the unrealized election in September, in the case of his election, to focus on the national team and the profit of financial resources.
He only decided to take part in the election before the last main meeting, so the two-month break would help him to defend and present his ideas about the direction of the football in a broader context.
"Audiences at all levels devote themselves to the football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels it's the highest time that the association is led by someone, the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonecer Club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and in the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are the euphoria that ruled at times of Ivan Hašek.
"In June the General Assembly was approved statutes that were not as perfect as all of them had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," said Pelta.
He used precisely the revision of the main document of the Citizens' Association as a locking tool for the delegates.
"If I would be chairman, I will take it personally and will be willing to bear personal responsibility if it doesn't work."
"This is a principle, without which he can't be," claims Pelta.
In addition, he does not try to limit himself to his opponent.
He had already announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognised because of his legal education and he well knows that his opponent was his first representative.
Tomáš Paclík has also for a long time no longer attacked, which again did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In the football he has been moving over a year and can already refer to certain successes."
"Their attacks were, however, decreasing and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That is why many doubt about his real character," Pelta addressed his contractor, who probably remained faithful to his proclamations, which he has already expressed in September.
He believes that his strongest gun is the knowledge of the football from the lower game classes, to the national team.
And this should be the hanging shield of Czech footballs.
"I would also strive to end all the affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the resorts of the corruption scandal from last year."
"Furthermore, I would fall into negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient financial resources for the whole football," said ČTK, six and fifty-year-old candidate two months ago.
He also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech football would not mean personal cleaning.
"I must first make myself familiar with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where, due to the long anarchy, nervosity is perceived.
Despite the contemporary catastrophic scenarios accompanying the coming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates do not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
"If really should be the only controversial point, as you choose in the third round, we'll get over it."
"The football needs credibility, and it only wins it if it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR starts working hard under him
If the former Vice-President Jindřich Rajchl had to be elected to the new chairman of the Czech Republic's football association on Thursday, this would supposedly avoid many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his election you will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
In addition, he promised to solve the case of Bohemian, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into the football and otherwise continue the work that the previous presidency Ivan Hašek started.
"As Chairman, I want to devote myself to the football as a whole."
Started by international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, about national selection, professional football, to the performance football for youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player, so I want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I'll distribute hard tasks so that the football can be progressed in every segment with miles-step."
Many would not just be disappointed because, instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now really have to start working hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it has been considered not to candidide at all.
"I know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me who don't throw my legs away and question every step I make," he said as a explanation of why he had delayed.
"But many people told me that I shouldn't give up because it would otherwise do others."
"This is trust that you can't play," he said.
Accordingly, he is also motivated to continue the work he has started under Hašek.
"In two years, we've managed a large piece of work and I don't want to throw it away."
"It has been started processes that may only come into effect in a few years and I would only be unhappy to see that she stops someone," he said and thus expresses his concerns that in the case of the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him stands above all people who would make the football so that he would only be there for chosen ones."
I'm sure you can suggest some things, but not that I'm part of it."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then it's all good and not just the chosen ones," said Rajchl.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a Chairman of the Czech Republic.
"Although some people claim the opposite, I really intend to do the best possible for marathons."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the League should not be divided into a Czech and a malicious part whose winners then rose up into the first line."
"Then it could not happen that today only three malicious clubs play in the League, which is a problem especially for the young players in Mareria," says Rajchl.
Because the Chief of the Pilsner Club, Tomáš Paclík, has joined the fight for the President's role, Rajchl does not trust to estimate his chances of being elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which chose me as its vice-president and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also considers the saving of twenty million crowns for unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the Lottery Act as its success.
On the other hand, he is partly guilty of the fact that the association does not draw on a single string.
While he says of Pelta, "he is disqualified from before to help the Czech football to new confidence," he considers the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who really has something to offer to the football.
"Nobody can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he was chosen, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek started and also the personnel occupyment in the Commission would obviously not change in principle."
He would certainly not want to turn things to his favor," Rajchl judges his rivals.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Sprung into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Plank baskets in Ufo optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: Who travels through Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after a city tour or hiking the tired legs in sprout baths.
A book shows where wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went to research in the past one and a half years, one was not allowed to miss in her luggage: her bathing suit.
Backing on the water, she looked high in artificially designed cobbles, she swim marble puddings waiting for them on the edge of the cup, and amazed over acribically restored youth style swimming halls.
If she felt a bath, she took it on flight in her notebook - as well as knowledgeable details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored the architectural historian Meder in this way - and now presents her in her book "Badefreuden": Volksschwumhallen in Munich, historical bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her travel to the most outstanding bathrooms in Central Europe: besides Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiastine.
With sport, she doesn't have much on her hat, says Meder - only in the water it's different.
It's just angry that swimming fans need to find themselves with blue tiles and chlorine tanks, while Jogger can breathe the delicious smell of fat forests or listen to joyful bird twins in the park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools should always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubled architecture
The wellness factor in baths is so large because all senses are used, according to Meder.
And if the builders have been struggling, swimming halls can be a true eyepiece: "One floor is a water surface in baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything doubles optical: high wool, colorful tiles, jumper.
The small-format video band "Badefreuden" offers 190 pages of knowledge of the architecture and culture history of historical wellness oceans - but especially a desire for a jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable copies in her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent healing baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an ureal carpet cave (a cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose baskets are filled with alkalimeous water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termáldö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, spectacular views offer many heated free baths in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in the eye from the Zurich Dachbad, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outer pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the vacuum pool there is a window from which you can watch driving on the ski pitch.
The most extraordinary pool design is expected to offer bathing guests in Longenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo landed right in the Alps.
From three open shells, it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the desert valley went to heaven.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in any swimming pool the pool collector Meder of the smell of chlorine rose into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell to sulphur, in the Arpád-Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strongly for heat oil, which is hardly believed to be landed in a health pool.
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogen carbonate containing healing water, which is almost black and its slick sticks to the skin as soon as you can glide into the basket - a wellness experience of the special type.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing sites: When she wanted to visit the free and sunbed in the Czech Bath of Luhatschowitz, she found a locked terrace.
The bathroom designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed.
When Meder threw a look through the whirlish windows of the red-white-gule youth-style building, she saw how weeds grew between the tiles.
On the other hand, in a magnificent swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction already have this bathroom behind themselves; not only can you discover neoroman elements that originate from the times of his construction in 1844, but also a maurian hall in the Alhambra style, which was added by 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of the Pole Master Iris Meder - and not just because it originates from the Black Forest.
"It is already a performance to merge such different styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, the diving in the thermal pool seems to be only a side matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets raw material business brighten through
By Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up her business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Joseph Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January the Head of the Group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of the Germans believe that it is not acceptable that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the respondents require that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the Foodwatch Consumer Organisation.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In this, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global raw material stocks are driving prices to the height - and the banks therefore have a shared debt to the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protectors is specifically directed against German-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann, even though large banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, raw material bets were intended to secure traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the sugars have disconnected from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the objections and said that no business is " worth putting the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank on the risk".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the suggestions from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the audit will be completed, then the results will be presented to the Director of the Deutsche Bank and recommendation on how to handle it.
At the end of January the bank's top will then announce the consequences it draws.
At the end, a reduction in the raw material business may be, or even the complete dispatch.
Ackermann bastled on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but at the same time he confirmed his criticism in the financial sector: "The betting on rising prices of food shows particularly dramatic how unrespectless banks today harm the general well."
Ackermann is now a senior bank lobbyist, especially in the obligation.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all the installations from its portfolio where money is used for betting at food prices," said Bode.
"No matter whether Mr. Ackermann is dealing with hungry people or about the reputation of the German Bank."
The insight of Ackermann comes on the first glance, but it is clear that the manager of the group wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from the Office.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the Head of Management will not change to the Supervisory Board.
With a rejection from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order for possible injuries, he hardly needs to be cut - it would finally have his follower to do.
Every second would terminate raw materials plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
More than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Institute Forsa asked 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Eleven percent, therefore, believe that it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank offers installations, where food prices are based.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such businesses: each second would terminate the survey, according to all the investments in which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would refrain from such a bank, 49 percent suggested that they would think about their account and switch to another institution.
21st House in Vienna
The moved pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian world exhibition pavilion of Brussels reached prices in 1958, became the museum in Vienna, was empty and explored.
Now he is reopened as a exhibition house.
If modern post-war architecture is weakened, of clear shapes, glass halls, courageous swings and new materials typical of faith in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is an enlightening and famous example for the Brosser World Exhibition in 1958.
Schwanzers Pavillon then received the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel glass construction.
The construction is considered as a contemporary architectural milestone.
He made known to the architects that he also built at the next world exhibition of Austria's Pavillon.
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus castlelike side construction in Munich, he was finally internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been set up, rebuilt and opened a museum of the 20th century in 1962 – the 20th House was called it after the world exhibition at the Vienna South Railway Station.
The building was not suitable but was not spacious and technical as a museum - no walls to hang the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used so long until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
The architect Adolf Krischanitz has now rebuilt the Pavillon, he is now called "21's house" and is used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the Museum of Belvedere, which belongs to the house, opens the first exhibition - a lucky fall in every respect.
The new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco, which became new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere in 2007, has been overcome.
Husslein-Arco, promovated art historian with a remarkable career, among other things, in youth as an ice artist, later at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, continued the conversion in politics and monumental protectors, created public resources and private sponsor money and established the use.
Except for present art, the works of the Bildhauer Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the same named foundation, a café and a book store should be provided, and a office house had to be built for this purpose.
Strong supervision, small ethics
Krischanitz was the ideal occupyment for the implementation.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna was sensitively rebuilt and expanded and gained competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavillon was a "absolutely important place" for him, where he had viewed the exhibitions "fast every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost generosity and ease during his transfer to Vienna and his reuse.
There were much bigger problems in today's reconstruction: the building was "a energy slider", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass fibres have been replaced, glass-faservered isolation glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel wires have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos filled ceilings have been cleaned.
Two subheads brought space for the new use, a reduced light digging between house and street ensures lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tailer pavilion.
The original outdoors are left, the house is stretched in the old red brown rust protection color.
And even the cinema is just as he was before.
And all of this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small etat.
"Oft had to be found a material that is good and cheap and also liked the Monument Protection Office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough soil in the lower floor.
Despite all forces, problems and reconstructions, the building has remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult if it had been with the Pavillon "who came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said a typical "Drop-in-the-City-History".
Such an architecture is "everywhere in the wrong place" and still wants to "wave a real consciousness".
In this case, the 21er house is not in the wrong place, for it has occurred a city-building lucky situation: around the Swiss garden is just the newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and dwelling houses.
And another lucky case may occur: The 21st house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca from Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Art Hall, and, as you hear, she already negotiates with the city for a neighbourhood location in the Swiss garden.
Train plants winter crisis package in millions of heights
The train has evolved a crisis plan to prevent train failures in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train failures and delays, the German Bahn has reported that this year the newspaper report adds over EUR 70 million.
The "picture" newspaper previously reported, calling on a concerted crisis plan, which was planned by 2015 to invest about 300 million euros.
This will improve the availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weathers.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for the removal of snow on railways and railsteads to 16,000 people.
The aim is to liberate railway hikes up to the start of the operation and 90 percent of the operating softs within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, Bahn-Chef Rudiger Grube had warned about train failures and delays this winter.
Last winter, the train had significant problems in passenger transport, as it lacks, among other things, in difficult weather conditions.
Thus, many new regional trains have been waiting for a permit from the railway federal for years.
There is also a delay in delivering ICE trains.
The train has also been making it possible for years to make ICE train axes considerably more frequent in the workshop after a ICE had a axis break in the Cologne main station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of penalties in the United States
After the tumult around Chief Joseph Ackermann, the German Bank has to pay a million bonus.
As if the problems at home weren't enough for the Deutsche Bank, the industry giants are also entering their past in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute pays 145 million dollars in a comparison (106 million euros) to solve disputes due to the Pleasure of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of hypocritical papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes a whole series of large banks that have induced cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have reduced the risks.
Such papers lost strong value during the financial crisis and the banks went into the depth.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the topic without having the parties to go to court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The bank did not accept any guilt with the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed itself to payment of $20,5 million.
The NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the receipt of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the U.S. Genossenschaftsbanks and comes in at pledge to protect the customer's deposits.
The NCUA is trying to replace the resulting billions of serious damages.
The comparisons that are now closed are the first of their kind.
The Regulator had also been in charge of other large banks and in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The relevant mortgage-backed securities are securities.
These are house credits underlying.
When the U.S. immobility bubble was placed in 2007, this became a number of financial companies to be obsessed.
In September 2008, at the peak of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers climbed.
Even if the events have been down for a few years, the banks are currently resisting a sharp wind in the United States.
Investors and supervisory authorities have endeavored numerous complaints in order to obtain reimbursement or to avoid mistakes.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest complainant wave.
It proposes 18 international large banks to have overdependled the two US immobili financers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in hypocritical transactions in the volume of $200 billion.
The Deutsche Bank also has to complain to the FHFA, here are several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires the Frankfurter to be equal to "substantial losses" without mentioning a precise sum.
The Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as haltless and declared to want to resist.
Warren Buffett increases by 10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests strongly in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has purchased shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until now, the big American investor Warren Buffett had always declared not to invest in IT and computer companies, since long-term development of companies is only a bad forecast.
But now he read IBM's business reports and changed his opinion on investments in the industry.
He has had to understand much earlier that IBM offers services in particular and provides computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
A investment of Warren Buffett is considered to be a riot in the financial world.
As a result, IBM may now call himself "Sir IBM".
For Buffett now revealed in the US economic sender CNBC that since March he bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM has not known anything about the commitment until now.
He commended the management that, even in the economic crisis, had made good profits.
"You have done a great job," said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM has been putting on the luxurious IT services for some time, such as the operation of calculator centres.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful company calculators.
Buffett had avoided technology companies so far.
He says he invests only in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett attacked, for example, on a freight ice train, on a smurf manufacturer or machine maker.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway also has shares in a whole range of large companies such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Municher back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and developed it with wise investments to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost inadequate sense of money earning has brought him the nickname "Orakel von Omaha".
After the Buffett investment was acknowledged, the IBM activity rose by a percentage at the moment.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock exchange and is together with Apple and Microsoft one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, but he doesn't want to go in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is viable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Cell", Turkish media doubt the German legal state.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology", which is now resuming.
The murders of eight Turkish tribes and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a legally extreme background.
This message will be responded with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German population in Germany.
Because for many German Turks, there is a long-faithful spic: since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more similar violence with the right-extremistic background against Turkish.
The fact that there is foreign enmity in Germany nevertheless was in question.
However, the discovered right-extremistic network reveals the extents whose dimension is not yet visible.
"Is the bloody ideology resurrected?" the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
On the other hand, the newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the offenders should have been a V-man of constitutional protection and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-radical sump.
Besons responded to the Turkish municipality of Germany: On the weekend, she reminded the victims of racist violence with a Mahnwake before the Brandenburg gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had thought in a festival of the fiftyth anniversary of the German-Turkish application agreement.
In joyful colors, the relationship had been scenariod - as a history of success.
As an earfish, the reporting of some Turkish media works: "Germany gift to fifty" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the backgrounds of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" can also not be taken to draw this thoughtful link.
"It starts to steep," says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He emphasizes that people were murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In German Turkish Internet Forums, the process of the police and their subsequent findings is extremely critical.
The authors wonder why the German authorities have not already seen it much earlier to look for suspects in legally-extremistic circles.
Some people are at least ready for drastic means: "If they continue to swallow here, the migrants remain nothing but self-defense and armament".
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"Because of the goodness of clarification and satisfaction of the punishment of the entire network is very strongly dependent on inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means when inner peace is in danger in Germany, the attacks of murders and solings in the nineties revealed.
The photo of the solingen fires is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a violent threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can fall into right violence.
However, the attacks sharpened our feelings on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the errors of the past
In the Turkish press then, the failure of German politics was deprived after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack by Solingen, he sent a compassional diagram to the Turkish Presidents, but he was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel at the time in his speech how many charges the Turks made.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current reporting of Turkish media once again shows how deeply the mistrust of many German Turks has been in the present legal state since.
In addition to the efforts to provide comprehensive information and re-evaluation of legally-extreme terrorism in Germany, it needs open words this time.
The Scandalbank of the Turisee
Europe's most adventureous bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then leaned from a crisis into the next.
Now it's supposed to judge a German.
Axel Weber wouldn't have thought that way.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Federal Bank, it was announced in July that he would reach a almost as spectacular new job in 2013: President of the Management Board of the Swiss Grand Bank of UBS - an unexpected and luxurious career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, Switzerland praised for its beauty and the UBS for its newly gained solidarity and made friendly comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS made the tournament."
"I look forward to cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But already in September it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A dealer of the UBS in London had rounded all the bank's security systems and amounted to around EUR 1.7 billion.
UBS director Oswald Grübel, a not only famous banker in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the President of the Board of Directors of the UBS has also been deemed to be attacked - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It was already known that Weber may advise the bank from February 2012.
And the presidency of the Management Board is already taking over in May - not only in 2013, as the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's gonna be hard.
He is not a banker, rather an economic professor and note banker and would certainly have had a working time necessary.
He then takes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that it is deserving the title "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Because the UBS is enormous on the one hand - until recently it was the largest assets manager in the world - and has been sliting from a scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, so it seems, the once proud Swiss bank remains spared.
It began in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and solid, but also exhausted Swiss assets managers had combined it with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a very large number in the investment banking.
Thus, the UBS 2007 managed more money than any other bank in the world with 1.6 billion dollars.
And on the other hand, it was a investment bank in the League of the largest banks in the world.
That made impression.
The first banker and later long-term banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger says: "My students I always set the UBS as a pattern of a good bank at that time."
From today's point of view, you wonder how could I just be wrong?
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something like something was in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, head of board Peter Wuffli came surprisingly back, who until then considered a highly intellectual and also gentle banker.
A few months later, they knew why he had gone.
The bank's investors had covered themselves with subprime papers and had to write down billions.
In order to train this, the UBS announced an increase in capital in terms of saying and write 13 billion francs.
In fact, she found investors, but those that some had been hoping over until recently: a transparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and an Arab State Fund that was so weakened that one could not even know his name.
But that was just the first strike.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, President of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, still the second best paid board of Switzerland in 2006, returned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: the UBS had to be saved by the State in view of its failing investments in the financial crisis.
The National Bank bought the UBS for twenty billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced change liability that she could become co-owner of the Bank.
The whole Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet sum of the UBS 2007 was more than five times as high as Switzerland's economic performance (see graphics).
"We couldn't save the UBS once again," says bank researcher Geiger.
The second came to the first disaster.
A few months thereafter, the UBS capitulated in tax struggle with America and said that they were willing to issue the data of potential customers who might have taken taxes by the Bank.
In addition, she agreed to pay 780 million dollars - as a refund of unjustified profits from these transactions as well as penalties.
Thus, the UBS knew more or less openly to have helped with tax rejection.
At the same time, she lost something that has ever been her capital in competition for rich customers: the Nimbus of silence.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same.
It followed the withdrawal of Head of Management and President of the Management Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
The Bank had thus lost its credibility in both central business areas within a few months: investment banking through the misspeculations and the assets management by aid for tax relief.
And just when it got a little more quiet, just when you thought that now the UBS will get it back, then this unclean dealer story follows: A single dealer is suspending EUR 1.7 billion before the bank notices that something is wrong.
And it becomes apparent: The risk management in investment banking does not seem to work yet.
"With the case of Adoboli, you have to find that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, Economist and Financial Professor at the University of Zurich Bank Institute.
The financial board of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not handle risk control."
It was just the idea of caution that the Swiss bankers had joined for a long time ago to become guards of the great assets of the world: no too high risks, security for money - even beyond the Alpine republic could break the world together.
The Tresores of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of indecisive reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The centre of the UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it is just a little larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Zuricher Bahnhofstraße, which leads from the main railway station directly to the Zurich Sea, which is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
You can find jewelry like Tiffany's between Swiss traditions such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks have stayed here: from the National Bank over the Palace of Credit Suisse to elitary private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is entering through a heavy turn door.
Inside the walls are marble dressed, there are thick leather seats, beside the bank logo a large sign of "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and credit Suisse, but at any time - or betray, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not want to read his name in the newspaper, finally, as all Swiss bankers, also do business with the two large banks.
The UBS had grown too large, he finds - especially in the investment banking, where the fishing axes had spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say there.
"And if so, they've long adapted to the seats of the fishing axis."
In fact, it was angelsächsian investment banking that changed the UBS, then paid its high profits and then the debakel: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the Subprime jungle as the Swiss Grand Bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was visible.
"On that Wednesday the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the greatest rescue action in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the large bank in front of bankruptcy.
How could it be?
If you speak with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks joined a huge group.
There was a bank that was already too large for small Switzerland – and continued to grow.
This helped the two different advance banks of the UBS supplemented: a rich, but sleeping bank with the focus on assets management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalised.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment banks came in favour of a lot of money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise in the UBS: Peter Wuffli, Group Chief of the UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Management Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, modest person who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdomen person who has worked up from the banking teaching to the top."
But Ospel left to Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, overmotion came before the case.
UBS employees are clearly reminded of the leadership meetings on which the group chief Wuffli repeatedly issued the same parole: Goldman Sachs jumps from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She launched the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks at that time.
Then the UBS wanted to go to the top.
Some steps have already been lucky to you.
She played in the exchange business and share trade at the top.
However, business advisers who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in the international interest business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American hypocritical products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that she almost cost the existence.
Hungry after growth, both the bank invested itself and a Hedge Fund in American subprime plants before it was founded.
It developed into a huge machine that packed and extended securities on American hypocritical credits, but also maintained risks.
Even when other banks were looking for the exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says Bankenexperte Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the case.
One manager had to go after another than the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS became the Schleudersitz and are awful until today.
Whoever leads the big bank now has a almost impossible job.
It has to find a strategy for a bank that has passed all nearby business models.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: Finish with investment banking, focus on assets management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go (now).
But the investment banking is supposed to shake strongly, so much is already clear.
On the next Thursday, the new head of the bank Sergio Ermotti in the world wants to present its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was actually considered as a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly separated from predecessors Grübel.
He has now pursued: he is supposed to run the businesses of the UBS permanently, the Zuricher Bank informed on Tuesday.
Ermotti intends to return the investment bank to the position of the mid-1990s.
3500 jobs he strikes.
But that will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask now.
Publicly, he has just said that he will find a apartment with his wife in Zurich first.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe loaded US stock
The threatening recession in Europe has given the US investors the courage to take up the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without force.
The threatened industrial production on the continent broke the hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in the world.

Especially financial values were on the sales lists.
The Dow-Jones Index of Standard Values recorded at 12.078 points for the closure of trade with a minus of 0.6 per cent.

In September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month, as the Eurostat Statistical Office announced.
That's what the US investors were skeptical: "We're not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to escape from a recession as soon as possible, and there are further signs of weaknesses in the banks.
The investment-leading Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything for the end of the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
Therefore, it is from his viewpoint too early to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett throws a decade old principle over the crowds and grew into the US technology industry.
His investment in IBM over $10 billion was based on the share rate of the traditional group and initially made it record nearly one percent higher against the trend in trade.

Intelligent crows spread in cities
Frequently, seed crowns are considered as "problem birds", but from the cities the high-intelligent animals are no longer allowed to be dispersed, claim experts.
The one likes them, the others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the city picture for centuries, but in many municipalities, dwelling on dread and noise of animals.
A means against the "problem birds" has not yet been in sight.
Seed crops are no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crown symposium in the East Frisian empty.
There, experts from the whole of the Federal Territories offer possible excursions.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Nature protectioners also brought the problems in cities to the flood of the particularly protected seed crops: the chemical use in agriculture has increasingly destroyed the traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing construction and the cases of typical brown trees made the birds life difficult.
Cranes are under natural protection.
Large colonies with more than 600 brown pairs are available, among other things, in the western soast, in the northwest, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim at Bremen and in empty.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the massive killing of crows in the countryside had provided negative slaughter lines.
Criticals had called the catching of the animals in bird falls and the killing with knees to be particularly brutal.
"The normal dispersion, the craving, does not bring anything," has the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver noted from empty.
Nesters spray with water or fall trees, often have unwanted consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals weigh out, large colonies split up and distribute themselves in other places."
Gambling is only possible as an exception to hospitals, age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the country, the problem in the cities will not be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from empty.
It can be considered that a combination of decaying animals from sensible residential areas and locking offerings to rebuild them at other places.
The psychologists and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, on the other hand, used information tables instead of chain sailing, for a completely different treatment with the animals: "We can finally bear a prick in the face most self-consciously."
Jürgens in Schleswig-Holstein had founded the Asheberger Krähen-Learning Path, on which indication signs informed about the life of the highly intelligent seed crops.
The project is already adopted by tourists.
Jürgens also had its own opinion to criticize the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication that they have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crowns not only use tools to get to a delicious bite but even produce their tool as a tool.
Conduct researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested four seed crowns as far as the intelligence of the birds is sufficient.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring a gun to crash with stones to reach a motten larvae.
Without much training, they were striving to recognize the size and shape of a stone to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the puffy crows then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small oak with a motten larve.
The birds couldn't reach their birds with the snail.
However, the researchers had put them wire pieces.
From that, all four animals formed a cooking, with which they then paid the oak on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crowns even came to this.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to EM 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks on a coup remained out.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland are involved in the EM 2012.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets to the European Championship in 2012 in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
As mentioned by the double successful Superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal hit Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth EM partition perfect after 0:0 out of the play.
The Czechs reached a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off back game at the outer side of Montenegro, after the hint had been a clear thing (2:0).
There was nothing more to burn Croatia at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland picked up a looser 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80).
The former Wolfsburger Bundesliga Profi Zvjezdan Misimovic with a transformed trade meter (41.) and Captain Emir Spahic (65.) had twice cut down for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the Yellow-Rote Map (54.).
Bosnia had already failed Portugal in the play-offs to the WM 2010 in South Africa.
In the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal reached a start by measure.
Ronaldo chased a free jump of about 30 meters to the early leadership in the masks.
A good quarter of time later, Nani showed his high-quality and met from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance by Torjger Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger of the English table leader Manchester City put a headball at the bottom of the Late, but the ball did not cross the line (33.).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Afterwards, Ergolding's divorce judge Wolfgang Stark was at the heart.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian Criminal Room, Stark decided to swallow and showed the yellow map to the Portuguese (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trade fmeter after a action by Fabio Coentrao, which was certainly transformed by Misimovic.
But after the break, the Vice-Europe Champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81th minute.
So the European Champion of 1976 will go to the EM for the fifth time.
The team of trainers Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga Legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) also had luck and had to survive a horror second in the early phase.
Endmann Petr Cech prevented a possible ownership by Tomas Sivok (9.) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the Duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
In the 40th minute, Damjanovic shot out of the rotation from the Criminal Border only nearly by the gate of Cech.
After the break, the cross-cutter had to save for the already hit world class tour of the Czechs, again the storm of the FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The gate soon before the end finally made it clear.
Because of this, Turkey missed Zagreb's football wonder.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not come beyond 0:0.
While the national trainer Guus Hid Dink thus has to leave its place as safely as on the bank of the WM third of 2002, the Croatians can rejoice about their fourth participation in an EM end round.
Before 31,000 audiences in the Maksimir City, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan met only the fosters in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim couldn't even sank the perpetrator in the gate.
However, after the horror securities, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians had nothing to burn on.
Besides Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made place from the 62th minute for the Dortmunder Ivan Perisic, the Bundesliga Legionary Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (introduct Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni goes to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated the first EM membership in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of trainers Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the play, in the 32th minute.
Constantine Vassiljev (57th) was equal to the guests.
Ireland pressed the speed from the beginning, but had to wait until 23 minutes before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment the Estonian rear team prevented the possible leadership.
But in the 32th minute it was done.
After an unhappy defense of endmann Pavel Londonak, Ward was at the place and pressed the ball to 1:0 over the line.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP invests billions in China in the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, the Dax Group announced that it would flow about two billion dollars (approximately EUR 1.5 billion), on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and set up employees accordingly," announced Co-Chef Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The employee is to grow from currently around 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of establishments of the world market leader for company software will double from five to ten or eleven.

Mass slaughter at a personal level
Sensitive and generous Peter Englund's new book "Scenity and terror. A story of the First World War, tells in nineteen shelters" with a long list of main persons who go to heart.
Here is a hint how you can handle: Cut this page carefully and make it your bookmark.
You will know these people in Englund's romantic story very well. And these main people will function as your GPS, as a light tower in these few moments when you are lost like Englund's men and women in the noble of war and robbed your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, determining the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He wrote an unusual book that he does not describe as "a work of the anti-history".
It contains only a few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, angry reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It's about" feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.
Beautifulness and horror: nearly the experiences of 20 more or less irresponsible men and women on both sides of the war together, from school girls and botanists to mountain climbs, doctors, car drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become war prisoners, lose members, become crazy or die.
Every one of these lives flakes up like the votivkercs in a church, some come to be added, while others expire.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating position war on the Westfront.
Beautifulness and horror are walking with expert views of other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, bee baskets fall, a celebrated Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsetflies are an insolvable problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moving book.
The war floods over the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, who smells for Cordit.
Imagine, you're a woman who's home with her children and hears canon fire in the distance. Stay or take the escape?
Who's coming?
Nobody understands what happens or why this war is led at all.
"Faling facts," says Englund, "was furnished with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, night dreams and rumours."
"Beautifulness and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmate.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other materials already published.
Their life reports may be terrible or spectacular, but they are extremely alive in Englunds of the in detail lost collection of small moments.
Many of them act of lack and help.
In the history of a German school girl, he says, "replacement, everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminium, false radiator rubber, paper associations, wooden knobs."
He tells more about replacement food in Germany.
He describes "Meat made from pressed rice and baked in hammel fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes that were sold with wood."
There were, as he noted, "837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the manufacture of cows, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are of honor and patience.
A American recognizes his own desire for wilderness and says about the war: "You feel that despite all this is what was more intended for men than to sit in the lean chair, with the evening leaf or the best seller and a cigarette and a whisky in your hand, and so to do as to mean such a facade civilization and as if there were no barbarei behind your own strengthened and defeated shirt breast."
On the other hand, a British soldier recognizes that he is likely to die and nobody will take note of it or take care of it.
"If you take away from the thought of offering yourself, you want to think that this is happening before a public," he writes.
Instead, it's as terrible as "a sentenced man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart and about new types of terrorism.
"The conflict became increasingly a economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Bestiarian of the still young century": "the word used and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the measure that kills while sitting behind a desk."
People act in an unforeseen way and there is just as frivol behavior as heroism.
Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively tried to attack a prostitute with a sexual disease to escape the front service.
"The great expression of it can be discovered in the trade with gonocokken eggs, because soldiers bought and smashed on their genetics, in the hope of coming to the hospital," he writes.
"You who were really desperate, rip him into the eyes, which led them to be blind for the rest of their life."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes smooth and yet inexpressive and perfectly adapts to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he embraces the way in which the war "resolved uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People begin to wonder why their leaders bring them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more distorted as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romans like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional glory hall.
His book has the most devastating end I've ever read in a case book.
I don't give it back anymore.
But it's like with his book he'd cut us off this page with the main personnel in front of the nose and burned up with a stickwood.
After early failure, a minutely planned transgression
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wore use helmets.
One had decided for the night of Monday on Tuesday because at this time there are hardly people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few high-level officials were informed. All others believed to take part in an exercise at the beginning.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them, and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was faced with challenges.
The incidents of the last weeks, such as the introduction of pepperspray against protesters, which violates the rules of the dissernat and made the householders a huge increase in public sympathies, were no longer allowed to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
Officers had prepared them by watching how occupations were handled in other cities.
A catastrophic exercise had taken place with a view to Zuccotti on Randall Island.
Officers strengthened the so-called Chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the rapid postponement of a large number of police officials - to focus on Low Manhattan.
The last training unit took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to move into the park came "in the last minute," someone who is familiar with the commands said what a declaration spoke as "exercise".
"The few policemen involved in my knowledge didn't know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew that the Zuccotti Park was the high-level officials of the resort."
One reason for the secret was a lesson that the city had learned.
On 14 October, officials wanted to clear the park, but then turned back when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned about these plans.
Officers of various police units were involved in the operation of Tuesday, including operation commands from all over the city - hundreds of mobile officials who are usually used in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day, many people in and out in the park, almost like Pendler, so 1 hour in the night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people stayed in the park," he said.
Delivery cars with Jupiter lamps and speakers were prepared before departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the news recorded in advance from the speakers seemed to be scared by many protesters.
When the public officials joined the park in their bright blue windjacks, many protesters simply collapsed their stuff and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 o'clock no tents would be taken to give the protesters time to pack their possessions and good together.
Other teams of officials were seen how they gathered in the area to intervene, arrests in the park should be required.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman of the police president, said that this had happened to their own security.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop watching the police operations in the park, and they said that the trafficking of the officials had been very cruel.
Mr. Browne said that television cars in Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
When the police moved toward the west through the great interchange of personal things of the protesters, including bags, artificial grasses and suitcases with clothing, their staff followed the city cleaning that lifted what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to go were threw out. Pictures of this appeared shortly later on the Internet.
A main kernel of protesters was close to the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park Position.
Some set up barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
Circa 10 people in the epicenter of the camp joined their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Officers of disaster protection were called to cut them off.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests were carried out in the park until 3:30 p.m.
The space was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most arrests came, as he said, because of "incompetent behavior and resistance to arrest".
The most prominent official in the area was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniform official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "not the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In the case of access, a second group of officials waited on the east side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block south, Barrikaden was built.
It was observed how these locations from the police continued to extend the circle around the Zuccotti Park.
In one place, as several officials, many of them with protective signs, were observed to drive people out.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern circle.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At five o'clock, a protester jumped south of Pine Street on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air from the tyre of a police bus.
In one place, the quantity threw a piece of lockwood.
At the end, a official and a protester came to the hospital.
The trade union of the maintainer will lodge a complaint against the city for release
The trade union, hundreds of school managers who lost their work last month, plans to accuse the city on Wednesday, as the dismissals are not necessarily and discriminatory because of their unpleasant influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The complaint is probably the last way that the trade union, district Council 37, is still open in its efforts to withdraw the dismissal.
Six hundred twenty-seven school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were among the poorest paid employees in the city and had lost their work in a chess train on 7 October, described the trade union leader as a political revenge for the last year of the city to refuse access to a health fund that the working groups had undertaken to close the budget gaps.
This claim was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the dismisses were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and explained to him that in the budget there is nothing specific that employees of school assistance would be released.
Officers of the City Council 37 said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference to inform the Supreme Court of Manhattan formally of the submission of the complaint.
The complaint will raise Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as accused and count eight dismissed workers as applicants who are all coloured or Latin American women, as most of the helpers who lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman of the city's Ministry of Justice, said that the city was not present in the complaint and thus their individual claims could not be commented.
According to the New York Times, the trade union has focused on the number of dismissals at schools in the poor quarters of the city to support a complaint for inequality. She claims that poor schools had lost more helpers because they were chronicly underfinanced.
It explains that while there were no releases on Staten Island and only a few releases in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, were lost and 46 helpers were released in the districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five of eight school assistants who were in Harlem at the public school 36, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: "This is not a neighborhood of deceited parents who can organize donations to start budget reductions."
P.S.: The 36. District budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, money was lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra financing for each arm school registration.
The trade union also complains that the heads of the High Schools were led to the wrongs by the language in a memo, which approved the release of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: translate) in the United States usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's salary list to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transmitted," says the draft complaint.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree with Libya
Finally, it looks as if the Republicans and Democrats in Washington were already to agree on the resurrections in Libya.
All that was necessary for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-term dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate's International Relations Committee decides on a resolution under the president John Kerry (Massachussetts) and Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), which praises Libyen for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "mother".
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libyen who have started rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, the legislators of both parties and the White House struggled about the word selection of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove the role of the US Military in the Libyen mission of NATO.
In June Kerry and McCain presented a resolution which approved the restricted use of US military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad margin group of both parties and there was no vote.
The same day, however, this law passed through in the Senate. In addition, the Chamber agreed to reduce the money for American operations in Libya.
This made the US mission into a kind of legislative fever - with a convention that was eager enough to criticize Obama's approach in the framework of the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull him away from the ground under his feet.
Then the undecisiveness of the Congress was overcome by the events.
Tripolis fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission ended officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "commends Libyen's people to their enormous courage and extraordinary endurance in their self-freeing" and "commends the men and women of the U.S. military army and their coalition partners that support military operations to protect people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also confirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libyen to democracy".
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Relations Committee or will they divide the legislators as it did in June?
The last version comes to the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republic of the Committee.
Lugars Sprecher said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it is the Senate to vote on a constitutional change this week, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every Congress Legislation period of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or of another area that is at the moment coming to the vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far attempted to bring their changes to the vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlate amendment is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been submitted to this Convention and covers a whole range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate - others are only slightly deviating from each other.
In the Senate alone, there are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change and a dozen more that would "control the federal expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - especially the beginners of the Republicans who want to polarize their course of life - the opportunity to splendle the possibility that they have such a measure "written".
The budgetary control law adopted in August requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that may be submitted to the Congress, while the Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to cancel the limitation to two terms of the President's office.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes which, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits a marriage among gender equals is, like a change that prohibits burning flags, a repeatedly returning template.
Some legislators also want to allow the withdrawal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states refuse them.
As eagerly as Members propose amendments, they are moving as faster as in recent years.
At the 111. Congress, the legislators submitted 77 such changes. at the 110th Congress 66.
The rate is left compared to the early 1990s in which members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, so the figures available to the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually already proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Featured but not conquered," said Giffords in the first television interview after the attack
Ten months after a armed man shot her from next distance during a electoral event in Tucson, the Republicaner Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on Monday evening on national television. She only sang to the Broadway-Song "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the one to return to the Congress.
When she and Diane Sawyer appeared in the ABC news "20/20", she ran after words and needed help to go.
The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery of the damage that the ball, which divided its skull, drilled through the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she came surprisedly back to the convention to triumphate her voice to blame brake.
In their first television interview after the attack in January, where six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and described their healing as "sweeping".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford answered: "Good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20"-special which was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the couple: "Gaby: A story of courage and hope."
The special is following Gifford's recovery since the attack of 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, it is seen in the hospital bed, with a cold rayed head and a long stool over the head.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show you how she performs simple movements.
A nick with your head.
A cock with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords will whisper another word: "Toast". She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show show show that music played an important role in Gifford's healing: You see how the Congress members sing together with the therapists of Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours daily with therapy, said that she cannot remember the day of the attack.
Her husband said that on March 12, he had read a article of a newspaper about the attack when she interrupted him and asked for the six people who had been killed during the attack.
The suspected protector Jared Lee Loughner is sitting in a prison in Missouri and is necessarily treated medically while waiting for his negotiating.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During the recovery of his wife, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, "Gabby, you weren't conquered?" said Kelly.
You've just been hit.
And you will get through that and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Truppers feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street galla collecting millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, matross, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The amount in black smokings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the donation in spring.
The role of the troops was different, among other things, by the Chief of Staff and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen.
"They were introduced like babies," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was compassion.
The hardly contradictory impressions illustrate the severe relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are raised with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its prize, say servants.
The public is increasingly acting as if you were doing people suffering in uniform.
"We weren't at all victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But the only way of support is to push us into the role of unhappy souls."
The topic is extremely sensitive to military leaders who want to appear unacceptable or in conflict with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger that the returning troops struck against the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about condolences in breastfeeding and privates between warveterans will take place.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel a.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a feeling of awe, as they were conquering rebels and traveling to exotic places.
Others would ask whether a "wrong, violent veteran hiding under the surface", said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and had taken over a high state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents were subtle to ask whether he was able to resist the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
"If you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions against it," said Cancian to his sons.
The lack of lightness of the military is partly rooted in the lack of American interest in war.
Services on the battlefield are rarely taken out by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as it was absolutely usual in the Second World War," said lord General David Barno a.D., commanding U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the prize of politicians and the public focuses mostly on the suffering of a servant.
Truppens find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they lost or for the gravity of their injuries.
Military is making the growing pressure to violate rape
This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of non-infringement in a rape before the military court.
If not, hundreds of applicants are ready for the next hearing.
Over-free Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a soldier's colleague at night.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her caserne in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met with a male colleague who had a 12-pack beer with her.
He asked her if he could come with her on a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texanerin brought her concerns on the side.
I thought, "Aye, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my stomach feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stood behind her, pressed her down and raped her, she claimed.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other present and former military officers are anxious for a trial with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which they decide whether a complaint against the former Defence Minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, has been granted before court.
The complaint claims that Gates and Rumsfeld have not been against the widespread rape within the military and under violation of the constitutional law of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the complaint included at first 17 applicants, but which rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men who alleged that they were raped or abused by soldiers and that the military failed to determine, condemn or provide an appropriate jurisdiction according to the suspected attacks.
Burke says she's following the top military leadership, as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically built," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the cultural remuneration of those? The leadership."
Burke also says that since February she has contacted nearly 400 survivors, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all the applicants, as a matter of fact, put their eggs into a basket, they will, if necessary, submit many further complaints to keep the pressure upright.
The Defense Team for the Ministry of Defense, as referred to by State Attorney Neil MacBride, has made an application to reject the complaint.
The acts of the Court of First Instance, which are available in the newsweek, in detail indicate the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries to which it has come into force.
Due to a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries of soldiers in the active service.
"The suspicious damage caused during the applicant's military service," the document states.
The Ministry of Defense refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
Teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles in both Iraq and Afghanistan, especially in contact with local women in the war areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in battle negotiations.
It's time the military is being modernized, says Burke.
And she is not alone in her struggle: three more complaints besides them are dependent.
At Yale Law School the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic prepares a complaint against the four main military academies because of the suspicion of a women's enemy atmosphere.
Independence of this, Vietnam Veterans of America collects a complaint against the military in which it is focused on the diagnosis of "personality disorder", the victims of rape in order to release them from the service - a common approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group appealed against the Veteran Administration (i.e. the administration of the war veterans) in which she provided her discriminatory practices in dealing with performance rights for persons who indicated being sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were presented independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress, which provides a number of points.
2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (i.e. the Office for Prevention and Notification of Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defense 3.158, sexual abuse was shown.
However, most abuses are not reported at all and, according to their own estimates, this number takes into account about 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases to which it comes a year.
The report, which was published in March, also examines the penalty rates: In 2010 20 percent of the recorded cases came before court in the military, only half as many as in civil law.
The applicants in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the suspicious rape of the military police less than one hour after the attack.
This night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole number of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker that came from a cut on his arm was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was listened to by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked for the sex she had with her friend before she had an offense.
Six people said to be characteristic in the name of the suspicious offender, who was finally freely spoken.
"I remember the day when the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the woes would be used, and I ran out of the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander, "It wasn't his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed a personal disorder and explained her as incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was dishonestly released, so that she could not receive any support.
Whether the complaint submitted by Lyman and the other complainants is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of legal science at the George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he says, "After my view, they should come forward."
What stands between them and a judgment is this doctrine which is criticized since it was first challenged.
I'm a critician of the Feres doctrine.
A decade behind the military, because they do not have the same incitement and the same disappointment that brings a liability.
He adds: "The chances are against them... but it is important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the lawyer of the complainant, will begin with her hundreds of other applicants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this respect until reforms come," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers watch on Facebook
Before he became the new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys who sent their anti-immigration idea online.
On Monday, Breivik, who had been standing at an ammo course in Norway in July where 77 people were killed, had his first public hearing before court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is not far alone in the Cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time until he attacked his computer and cheated with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-extreme groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you just have to log in at Facebook.
"We have discovered that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report from the UK Ideas factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hide of personal data is so encyclopediatic, Bartlett says that researchers simply need to use the site's advertising tool to specify their desired demographical data with scientific accuracy - as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found a half million fans of right-extreme groups throughout Europe and then looked at them with adds, but instead of linking them with a new band or a new diet product, adds invited users to a survey in which they were asked for their educational status, their attitude toward violence and their own future assessment.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once.
"It's a quite new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprised. Online supporters right-extreme groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprised distortion, "they who combine their online activity with a offline activity are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is only an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas, medical researchers and policy scientists use the page to study everything, from health issues to social trends such as "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding three content per day, Facebook's "Datensupernova" generates a research tree that has increased the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title in the last five years by nearly 800%.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people that you usually do not reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to question people of the British National Party before, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and they would never have given them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook it's all gone - you're going directly to them."
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to recognize and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full discussion on Facebook are significantly more likely to drink problems than students who swear about this subject.
Moreno suggests that equal students, such as residential consultants, monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you didn't recognize it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Co-Autor and Head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle der Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify threatened children that wouldn't have been found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly embraces the data of its own population.
The data team of the page has created statistics on the status of relations and Valentine's Day, participation in the intermediate elections in 2010 and a national luck index (which has primarily been used information on which only Facebook has access - Masters of Digital Freedom for a long time know that the page should make its large data foundation for others available for research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the page watches them whether they want it or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you can get your own personal data from the page.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey that they do not even know anything about?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I do not believe that many users have thought at all about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a study from 2006 in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for her, it was only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information is true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no replacement for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research needs to take care of social life - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Cold and inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who had two amoclops, with whom 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple rider of Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, as you have received your mandate from organisations that support Hassideologics and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit the laws, but I don't confess myself guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, because he wanted "Breivik not to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason he refused Breivik, who brought a prescribed speech, the permission to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in investigation for 12 more weeks, he has no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will monitor all visits and the whole correspondence for eight weeks.
Approximately 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind castle and riegel.
Everyone participated in the goal that everything was going out on a way.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian Sender NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it goes a bit further after I have seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue crab and worked quietly and professionally during the entire hearing. He looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors when he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre indication that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not spiritually ill and said there was no evidence that he had complicated.
Some may like that the attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically facilitate the grief and confusion that a whole nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he does not," said the family of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons of the interview with the dead Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford and highlighted the genius of technology as a great modern inventor.
But what Apple-Fans may find the most intelligenceful in the recent Jobs interview that was discovered this week before special film performances on the important markets, is how much this creative head understood business processes and working processes.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-designed Hippie, but he was also an acribian organizer who was zealously based on diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffered from "a disease of thinking" that is a really great idea of 90 percent of work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the experts" about the break-up of the staff computer, and he was sitting for more than an hour with jobs in which they conducted one of the rare, detailed conversations.
At that time, as 10 years ago, Jobs had been forced from Apple, and he already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in specialist idiotes, he says that the copying templates of the interview were missing in the delivery.
Only after Job's death, a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This easily revised film material is the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The lost interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to abhor detailed interviews, Jobs here appears surprisingly zealous in the explanation of his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredible thought.
During the interview, there are four longer breaks between Question and Answer - 10 to 15 seconds reflecting in which jobs are clearly considering his thoughts and striving for accuracy.
There are also moments in which Jobs' Perfectionism comes to the day when it appears to be impatient to Cringely's questions and encourages him to deal faster with topics or adherences of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview appears somewhat incredibly far-sighted when jobs evaluate what other companies make his opinion correct or wrong and represent their own vision for the future of the computer.
It's a matter of reading post-hume Scores of the career Jobs'. But to see jobs here as the greedy dreamer who is on the jump to greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this here, he left and made it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to lead a company:
"During all the years in business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, it's made easy."
Nobody knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks about things.
I found that.
Jobs continue his efforts to rationalize the accounting of Apple.
Surprisingly, how costs were recorded - most of them started with "standard costs", which were decisive to mere suspicion and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed a automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined until the smallest.
How the Pope was specialized:
Jobs tells about the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to snatch into the telephone company and lead remote talks for nothing.
About the device has been written a lot, but Job's enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as a act of self-authorization, is annoying.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable phone, using a call and then connecting from a AT&T network to another while they pass through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things a half dozen times around the globe and when you grew into the phone, it came out a minute later in the next phone," says Jobs kichering.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that can control billions of dollars on infrastructure all over the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that could control a huge thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without them.
Jobs continues to tell about a glorious strike, the Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called through Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope, while they were able to kill Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called back in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope came to the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and called unprepared Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone desk, jobs received part-time work at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen in the age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated his employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
He was as big as a bag, had a small screen with brown tubes and I was in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
More times in the interview, jobs talk about how to invent spontaneously new products.
Early in his career, when he built some platinums, he was asked by a customer to build the entire computer together.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to consider both the composition and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple he recalls the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember permissive arguments... They screamed that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Nine days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15.
About large companies that leave:
Long before he resurrected Apple, Jobs saw the paths on which so many industrial gigants had their visions in Stolpern and lost control over their shares.
"Do we say you work with IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copyer or printer, na and?"
They own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it are those people] who eventually lead the companies and the product with which people are pressed out of decision-making.
The product genealogy that has led to this monopoly is required by people who do not have a concept of good products versus bad products - craft art.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger, the Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
You caught the defeat of the victory.
About innovation as a art form:
"It's a lot of crafts art between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his fools.
You have to make votes, certain things that you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5,000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Finally, it goes out to taste, it goes beyond that you try to align yourself with the best things that humans have created and then try to bring these things together to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, threw great artists.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people working there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who were randomly the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dining with opponents of health laws when court accepts case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically shared question whether one will listen to a fight against the health laws of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner sponsored by the court that the case was represented before court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to consult the petitions for testing.
One of the cases to be addressed was a complaint that raised 26 states against the widespread reform of the health sector, which was decided last year by the Congress, a law that became a term for the conservative activists everywhere in the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, in March, a 5 1/2-hour basic distortion is expected, which is likely to lead to the 2012 Presidency struggle, which will be in full at the time when the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who is in court and will claim that the law is to crawl, will probably be Paul Clement, once General State Prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush.
Clement's office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies who supported the annual dinner of the federal society, an oldest group dedicated to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another company sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who fight the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical gigant Pfizer Inc., who is extremely financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had consulted the case in a Washington hotel.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Head of Group of the Republicans in Senate and a declared opponent of health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges have been visiting events of the federal society for years.
And that does not breach moral rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the Code, which says: "A judge can participate in benefits events of law closer and other organisations, where the Judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest or a program to be a guest of such events."
Nonetheless, Scalia and Thomas have reached the extreme proximity of two of the firms related to the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in it to alarm moral and government activists.
"This amazing fracture with morality and the contrast to the code punishs the complaints of some judges lie, the court observes the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinned during a beneficiary event with lawyers with floating proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support of a donation action for this event undermine any right to inpartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say that they would mix court matters too easily with groups that can lead themselves from the agenda, such as the federal society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an advocate-general under the Obama government when the first law appeals came before court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case for pre-acception, as it was too committed to the defense of the law in order to be inconsistent.
Kagan does not make an intelligence to do this.
Boeing draws record order from 18 billion dollars to land
Airline Emirates orders 50 two-way aircraft of type Boeing 777 with one option to 20 other aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than 1 billion dollars.
It is really a rare news that a company gets a job over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business if the company is Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 planes is totally a record sum of 18 billion dollars.
Also unusual is the contractor of Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future flight orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago Company estimates that airlines from the Middle East in the next 20 years need 2.520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced his biggest task for commercial aircraft on the weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-way Boeing 777 Jets.
The Hammer's order came from the Air Force Emirates from Dubai.
In 2011, Boeing announced that the airline also has an option on the purchase of 20 additional aircraft, which makes the total list price rise to $26 billion.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, who greatly improved the fuel consumption and comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than 1 billion dollars.
"That's absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a stockmaker of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by the oil-producer countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but rather an increase in oil prices that usually harm the airlines, as this is one of their largest cost points, is not so harmful because the country deserves at a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or move flight orders when the oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural assurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leadership position on the large-space aircraft market and helps to keep the Airbus competitors SAS in chess, who attacks the power position with the A350.
Boeings victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that the introduction of the largest A350 would be postponed directly with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was shifted to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher burden of use and scope.
The Boeing Acts increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses apparent election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug dealer has supported opponent Fausto Vallejo by the PRI in the race around the governor's posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her application for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug dealers had influenced the race for one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo has won the race around the Governor's posts in the western state by the institutional party of the Revolution, the PRI.
"The intervention of organised crime during the whole election process and especially on yesterday's day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview one day after the election on Sunday.
"You threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys ... you have occupied election cabins, built road blockads ... and ordered people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven decades in Mexico until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have hit Claderon little, which had been conducted in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a victory.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the currently official governor, came to place three, a severe defeat for the split and happily left leader for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denyes connections with drug dealers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been dominated for a long time by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amfetamine.
It is the home country of President Calderon and he elected Michoacan to start a militaryly guided openssive against drug dealers in December 2006.
Violence is still on.
A PAN Mayor was killed a week before the election during a electoral event for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates have risen out of fear from local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how distinguished the elections appear in Michoacan.
The man who is probably representing the PRI in the race around the Presidential Office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington, saying, "I think that this victory makes us look courageously next year."
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the euro area in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will inhibit the growth of Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB with a seat in Manila, said that the two most rapidly growing economic nations of the world have to do "all things standing in your power" to speed up the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brasilian, Russia, India, China) who look "without suffering" on the difficulties in Europe and said that financial support for European leadership and European resources through Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So everyone who can help Europe from this crisis is helpful," he said the Financial Times in an interview on the edge of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If China and India can help, then with all means."
The European Monetary Union has suffered a serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs increased dangerously, and the Prime Ministers have withdrawn from both Italy and Greece.
The incoming severe debt crisis in Europe is anxious that the global economy could fall into the recession and led to calls that the leading threshold countries must join in order to support the euro area.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia is channelled by the IWF, but he said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds of the EU Rescue Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) - offer greater negotiating power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister for Commerce, said that "India will do everything in his power" to help the euro area, since its own economy is now suffering from the falling exports and the dry foreign capital flow.
"None wants the euro area to remain instable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to get a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a job, because where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India do not have the motive to help the rich Europeans if they face major economic challenges themselves.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the U.S. Brown University, said it would be politically difficult to sell the 1.2 billion people in India help for Europe, of which more than 800 million of $2 or less lives on the day.
"Sometimes, they will find out that the Greeks are going to retire with 50 and spend holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid employees in the public service in Greece, with jobs in bad direction, lossing facilities such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro area will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The projection of ADB with a economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011/threatens now "the risk of degradation" due to the threatening danger from Europe.
He said that injurious threshold markets would have to create "crises plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and a significant capital immigration of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon from possible intersections in the defence
The Defense Minister Leon Panetta called the conference on Monday when he warned that automatic budget reductions would weaken national security without notice, so he triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon halls to the war scenes in Afghanistan and the civil flow bands.
The Pentagon already reflects reductions of 450 billion dollars during the next decade, but now fears that further reductions will be necessary by 600 billion dollars or more if the Congress can't reach a conclusion in the expenditure.
"The impact of these reductions would be devastating for the Ministry," wrote Panetta in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that failure of the Congress to reach a budgetary agreement, which will lead to a so-called consolidation, would lead to 23% general reductions and a stopping of many new projects.
"Such a high reduction, performed in such an unforeseen way, would make most of our ship and construction projects incomplete - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or building - and other modernisation efforts seriously harm," wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be forced to distinguish ourselves unwillingly from a large part of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we have to ensure that civilians are safely bound to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who keep our army upright and seriously harm our alert willingness."
The reductions have finally met the battle troops," said Panetta.
"When the war time quotas in the anti-terror struggle are not directly affected by the consignment, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect the efforts of war," warned Panetta.
"Personal settings have been reduced, which would lead to delays in the settings and the setting oversight that support war."
"The wages of the staff would be reduced, resulting in late payments to war-time dealers and the legal and political support would be disturbed."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of automatic reductions on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of a defensive defeat would lead to a rapid downfall in the United States as the world's leading military force."
"We are vicious against this draconic action," the senators said in a joint declaration on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly nothing that we should be pushed on."
"The consignment should not be allowed to threaten the United States' national security interests and their entry into force."
Whether Panetta's letter and the new warnings of senators will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands to remove the pentagon from reductions, remains waiting.
Panetta has increasingly expressed the possible reductions, although he has been able to collect many years of experience with the budget in the Congress and the White House before he arrived at the top of the Pentagon and knows that he is facing severe decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Minister of Defense painted a dark picture that could be expected - a military with shell, but without core.
"It's a ship without matroses."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an airgun weapon without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tire, a army of the hosts, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission," said Panetta in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a war that lacks moral and alert and is not able to take it up with potential opponents."
"It makes you really be angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta added new details about how reductions "createsignificant operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global use and intervention capacity, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could be victims, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombing aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new soil vessel that army and marine needs to replace the Humvee.
If you stop the further development and tests of the F35, this would save up to 80 billion dollars in the next 10 years, but the supporters say that it is an important next step to renovation, so that possible dangers can be banned by China and other opponents.
How to Distore a Lion
A look at the current headings shows how uncertain and widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
The presidential candidate of the Republic, Herman Cain, is busy to become the accusations of sexual harassment by several women, both of whom are accused of the lie.
The leadership of Penn State is accused of the Minid, as it is claimed that you have kept back reports after which a retired football trainer has sexually abused boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed to the American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Laughter destroys careers and shakes countries.
The New York Congress Abgeordnete and Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became foolish when he brought denials that were very quickly rejected by unsuccessful evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the infringement in the campaign financing which is related to the deployment of an out-of-health business.
And then, of course, no one who experienced it forgets the media circus that president Bill Clinton triggered when he lied at the Oval Office during his second term of office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about shoes in school and at college tests are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the answers to the examinations so that they did well in their performance tests.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and shames are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, however, are regarded as emergency lies.
Another study shows that foreigners lie each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Knowing lying or "discovering lies" is one that is important to learn for every human being, both for personal and for professional reasons.
Apart from a social game, such as Scharaden, where it is the goal of calling "Hab you!" is the distortion of a deception of a serious knowledge area based on scientific data collected over the past six decades of viewed universities conducting extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
A result of research is that most old myths have been distorted about lying.
Lying looks in your eyes.
They don't always stomp, stamp, roast and dare.
However, we must not conclude that these liars are difficult to discover and distinguish.
A practiced lie-entator can pass through to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine expressions of face, questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing range of detonation, and it is clear that distortion of a deception is a modern ability that is easy to learn and helps us in the realization of our complex world, especially if the setting-up or questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belongs to our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good in estimating other people who are interested in and dominate their own emotions, and they feel intuitive as they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that the extrovert people are more often lying than introverted people, that men often opt for "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often lying their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that when a person was distorted as an evildoer, others feel less guilty of lying to this person.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, by watching the normal behaviour of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for the later evaluation of changes.
Watch the attitude, laughing, the voice quality of their test person.
You should better know when someone normally trippels with the foot, so that they do not accuse him of wrong when he trippels with the foot during a meeting.
Then take care of accumulations of opposing verbale and non-verbal behavior.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that scream, not as evidence of distortion.
People who deceive may stare when they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet show towards the door or they reject towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxion after the attitude conversation", this deep, relaxing breathing and the change in the position when all hard questions are over.
Asking often falsely signals that an attitude talk is over, only to keep a look after this relaxation after the setting talk.
Also, look at the language of your experimental person.
The extortionsman of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the form of the past when he claimed that his killed wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Thrilling people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in general.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtil.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Now... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... according to best knowledge and conscience."
Thus the answer becomes more perceptive than factual, which often shrinks the alarm bells.
There is no magic for the detonating of lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to the possibility of distortion.
Thanks to these abilities, everyone can be more rarely victims of fraud, both in private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is revised after danger by delayed US authorisation
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, so that the trade unions were agitated and at the same time calmed for environmental protection, the pipeline-building companies are trying to reconstruct the project so that they can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be redirected from the environmentally sensitive area of the sandhills into Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the House building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline is finally approved, although with another course.
This was the case after a notice from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after a decision on a federal authorisation for the project was taken to avoid the new possible course which would prevent the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large subwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed, may delay a decision by 2013, after the elections in the next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and confessed its support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrel oil a day from Alberta Province to the Raffineria in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline had to cross six states.
Environmental protectioners hate them, but they love labour markets because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, who are against the plan, weigh the laws to force a withdrawal from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had little impact on the environment, but the source of energy industry says that the main auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate approach to the review procedure, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether Paul Elliott, who was a consultant of Hillary Clinton in 2008, has a lobbyist, who has been postponed by TransCanada, in a conflict of interest.
The second is whether a company responsible for carrying out the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused, as she claimed to have a little child in fear to break up
A New York family claims that the Disco-Diva Patti Labelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building would have had a tobacco attack that would have put her little daughter in so much fear that she had passed away from fear.
The tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" singer made the 18-month old Genevive monk so afraid that she suffered from "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers", said her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was the 10th November last year when the stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Rosena, a child gardener, and Genevieve wanted to break up for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Rosanna Monk went to the lobby with the bag and Genevieve on the arm in her building at Riverside Boulevard.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on the arm," she said.
LaBelle urged the pregnant woman to be angry.
"She said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't put your daughter near the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and started to shame - she used the F word and the A word and became very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to kick water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you have done with my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle crashed on the mother who still drew Genevieve on the arm, and had to keep back from her accompanying and be moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology, but did not receive a reply.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls in which an opinion was requested.
The complaint is based on a non-determined compensation, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he would not pay any honor and plan the family to spend the money they get on child cancer aid.
"We want Patti Labelle to take responsibility for her behavior," said Davis.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely inappropriate, especially when it is placed on the day of a child gardener who wears an 18-month-old baby on his arm."
Climate Differences Breamed the Economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is a government, unemployment and black work increased in Sinaloa, while foreign investments decreased and the economy slowed down.
In 2011, Sinaloas' economic history will keep in mind. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who calls himself the initiator of change, and is a great hope for economic growth, is the government. However, due to climate change, growth cannot be the case, but the most important economic indicators were worsening.
The low temperatures in February did not only cause millions of losses in agriculture, but also set close limits on state economy growth and in the first quarter a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 per cent, mainly as a result of the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 per cent, which reversed further economic sectors.
According to a report published by Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (i.e. the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agriculture) on the effects of Frost, 582 000 hectares of agricultural lands were damaged, of which 78.03 per cent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has continued to increase unemployment in the Mexican State. The Instituteo Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, since 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment from January to March, which corresponds to 4.53% of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased to 5.28% and from July to September to 6.19%, resulting in 74.000 in Sinaloa. This is 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Low liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented indirectly, the public institutions' policy explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently watching is an increase in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses on the market due to the reductions in the budget by the legislation adopted to combat money laundering in the Congress, because it is not easy for those who forbiddenly raise dollars to let them work for themselves, invest or use them for something else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growth in unemployment is also a demographical factor.
"The number of people who leave the country in search of work in abroad, especially in the United States, has declined. This is due to the problems of entering, and on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work that makes unemployment rise," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if you take into account the high proportion of black work, including 60.38% of employees in the country who work without paying in the cash of social insurance.
Unemployment and black work are the lowest wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituteo Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Assurance Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Region for Work and Social Care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was by September 5352 Pesos, much less than the national average of 7375 Pesos.
Reduction of ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the growing unemployment, the strongest decrease in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the ADI was from January to June 630 597 dollars, which corresponds to 87.74 percent in comparison to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) records on the other hand a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies from the tertiary sector.
The debts
In the light of the economic crisis, the national government in July requested a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos, which should be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities. The country Congress approved a sum of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive effects of debt could be found on any of the sectors in the country until November.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, Mario López Valdé's first year of government incapacity was evident.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of the Processing Industry in Mexico) said that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonise the views of the various sectors, including the national government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really hard this year. It needs to be worked hard to recover the terrain lost this year, and in 2012 we have to take a double effort. The efforts of all, in particular, the progress of the already well-established government team have not been sufficiently agreed together," he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo López stated that events, such as frost at the beginning of the year, made the country's economic development difficult and slow.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the Frost. One of the most important effects is a slow economy that is not sufficiently in motion to create an economic dynamic that could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore we will finish the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine the call
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Entrepreneurs Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa explained that the state had to become more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme to redefine the economic profession and line of the country, because it is important to activate all the material and human resources of Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that leads the government's efforts to improve its efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He stressed that the current state force made progress in the government.
"There are areas that can be said that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg Marihuana
A population of Navolato was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days for the possession of eight kilos of Marihuana.
The Republic’s State Prosecutor announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against public health - here the possession of Marihuana for trade.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican armies in the monitoring of the Cipriano Valdez road against the watchpost No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving in a white delivery car where he stored a black bag in a box in the car and on the accompanyer's seat a small backpack where the military found eight pounds and 23 grams Marihuana.
For this reason, the confisked product was handed over to the judge of the district and the punishment remains in the executive body.
Guilt for construction
The social buildings for migrants provided in the programmes Habitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 are at risk of not being completed because of lack of resources or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The leader of the urban social development authority explained that although the construction programmes are already advanced, they are now in danger, since the government has not paid the funds for the three programmes exceeding 11 million peso.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes amounts to nearly 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality would have contributed to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction process should be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is finished, they have not given us a phennig, and that, although they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "In order not to be late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla the State had not fulfilled its obligations, so at the beginning of its government the municipality had to take up a loan of 7 million. This was the amount that the central government had to make.
"This has been the way in the last legislatory period, because the State did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes continued and this year we had to get the funds that the State had not taken to participate in these programmes," he said.
Although the state authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance had been requested to speed up administrative work and pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"At almost 12 million they have to contribute, and although the year is already going to end, they haven't given us a phennig."
The Court approved the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogues to digital signals in recent years is one of the most important changes worldwide.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional complaints submitted by the Senate and the House against the Presidial Assessment and rejected the movement of analogues to digital signals from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required for the objection of law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the Decree of Law with the details of switching to terrestrial digital television.
This Decision rejected the constitutional struggle raised by the Senate, as it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes in order to allow the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the project for the complaint drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to explain the Decree of Constitutional Decree for Constitution, as the regulations relating to radio and television are responsible for the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), therefore the Decree of Law would contradict the hierarchical principles and regulations.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputy lodged constitutional complaints against the Decree of Law. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Decree of Law and initiated all activities to establish the digital transmission.
The Council also rejected the complaint submitted by the Chamber of Members without taking part in the debate on the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In its contribution, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the government of the countries is not allowed to regulate the measures to be taken by the public administration by general rules.
"I do not believe that if you do so, the independence of the regulatory body would be impaired." She also recalled that for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as telecommunications sectors, because it is directing state affairs.
The replacement of the analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have been made throughout the world in recent years, and it will improve the use of the radio-electric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The transfer of the transformation, she said, is a shift in the use of digitalisation, which is a decision in public interest which does not only have technical aspects, "for they are inconsistent with economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "required the operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic leadership by the State, they included a group of characteristics that lay the constitution into the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries had already carried out digital transformation worldwide, although they had highly specialised institutions.
It was not possible to conclude that the government would intervene in the competences of the Congress with the issue of the contested law, because the laws adopted by the Legislative would be respected," she assured.
The possibility of counting the voting in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place in the choice of the governor is nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 have not yet been counted.
This year, the possibility of individually counting the voting list is a reality in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Elektorales Preliminares (PREP) the difference between the first and second place in the governor's elections is nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes from a total of 6074.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Elektoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, reminded us that the election body had adopted a series of rules for the harmonisation of local regulations with the reforms of the states in election matters just last 9 November.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had neither adapted his political constitution nor his election law nor his law on the right of election to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force at this election round. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the State Indicator within the time limits provided for by the Congress with the argument to have any objections against it.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional plea submitted by the local legislation and judged the vote of the representative on the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" because it did not have the right to "determine or put a veto against it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained at an interview about the possibility of individually telling the votes that, thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM, the possibility is now that the local electoral authority can count the voting point partially or fully.
Under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more election packages may not be in accordance with the results of the protocols; the protocol on the numbering and calculation of votes is not actually available, or it is not owned by the chairman of the election committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the protocols.
In addition, the total counting of the full-filled voting licences may be made if there is a difference between the suspected winner and the one who is in the second place, equal or less than one percentage, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party-or coalition chairman who is the second of those candidates.
The votes can also be counted in their entirety if, after completion of the regular calculation, the difference between the suspected winner and the candidate is equal to or less than one percent, provided an explicit application is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the election packages that have been posted a partial countdown would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is nearly 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 of a total of 923 votes have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be spread across the Zapalinamé mountains, confirms the family.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés rubbed this Sunday evening at Saltillo, its place of birth. On Monday the death scene and a death knife took place.
According to family members, the last will of the suppleutnant was that his ashes would spread across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila with the others in the event of the accident and returned in a plane of the Mexican Air Force to the capital of Coahuila. The chief of the next person took part in the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At 12 o'clock in the afternoon, the ashes of the superintendent landed at the mourning hall, located at the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family and friends came.
At 5:30 a.m., his remains were examined at Saltillo's Technological Institute. This body show was initiated by his former schoolmates from the technical Abitur and his American football team, Felipe Bacio during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would spread over the Zapalinamé Mountains, which he had always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the sister of the pilot.
From her viewpoint, the superintendent had fulfilled all his dreams and she believed that he had been in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother, and he was always in favour of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the Air Force School of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it because they thought it would even faint him on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strived to realize his dream of becoming pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembered him as a good man. "He had hardly arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him as when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that he was driving even at the age of seven to Zapopán to graduate his family. Therefore, he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: a plane flying.
A last date
The superintendent of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was adopted with all honor under the governor Jorge Torres López. Its honor gave him the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, School Manager and Students of the Technical Education Institute of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and was excellent both in study and sport.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when his flying helicopter crashed, in which also State Secretary José Francisco Blake Mora and six other persons were sitting from the same authority.
At 6:05 p.m., Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, met to be transferred to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, to his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers.

On Wednesday education of the new Italian government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets with the President of Italy tomorrow to present it to the new government, which is intended to offer the head of the crisis that Italy has led to the edge of the economic collapse.
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, meets with the President of Italy tomorrow to present it to the new government, which is intended to offer the head of the crisis that Italy has led to the edge of the economic collapse.
A communication from the Presidency Palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with the President of State, Giorgio Napolitano, in order to confirm government education on Wednesday.
It is assumed that he will present a majority of the chabinet composed of technologies, although it is not clear when the new Prime Minister will enter his office.
Monti said he would present the results of the discussions with the political parties on government education to the President.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti did not expressly confirm government education, but his comments show that the obstacles are overcome.
The "frame is now well stuck," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy fights against a political and financial crisis that has driven the costs of debt into an intolerant level.
The new government, led by the former EU Commissioner Monti, has to adopt a hard package of savings demanded by Europolitans in order to restore the confidence in Italy that was being struck.
The pressure at Monti was still increased by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of the 10-year taxation of Italian government loans with 7% interest, which corresponds to the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue protection.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industrial Association of Confindustria, announced the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government according to all the powers."
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
The chances of success Montis were significantly increased by the support of the PDL party by Silvio Berlusconi, which had to decline on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Middle-Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, as many of its members have been pronounced against a majority of Technocrates, which is just forming Monti.
Parliament's support
The new Government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unwanted savings measures.
Resistance against its efforts or delaying reforms could again cause a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks exercises with its indication that a failure Montis is a disaster, also pressure.
Monti began on Monday with its debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneurial associations as well as with youth and women organisations.
The meeting will be completed in the evening of the Tuesday.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, in response to the crisis, launched an extremely rapid government change.
After a short breath against the end of the last week, as it was known that Berlusconi would fall back, the uncertainty of the success of the new Prime Minister has again reached the cost of Italian government loans critical limits.
A salvation of Italy with a government debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU recovery screen.
Monti said that his government must take up to the next elections expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said that he would like to take politicians into his cabinet, but the large parties claim that this should only consist of technicians, a point of concern with regard to the procedure laid down by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties make the involvement of people from political life complicated.
Spanish have more toys than the Ticos
From the 22 players picked up from Spain ten have more than 50 international games on the buck.
From Costa Rica's pages, only one of the 22 calls has 50 games behind itself.
A giant difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are comparing each other for the friendship game, which takes place today at 15.05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the World and Europe Champions, the number one on the monthly ranking of FIFA, can look back on a considerable number of selection games of class A, the three-colour team only has the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number on Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England each year have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (Liga and Cup champions) as well as high-range Europecups such as the Champions League.
In addition, the experiences with the Spanish Furie in complicated excretion games at the Eurocup and the football world championships come.
On the other hand, the Tico footballers have a few international meetings in the context of the Concacaf, which is on the FIFA range list at the bottom.
We will see how the Spanish team draws its last register: Torwart Iker Casillas, who reached a balance with the former Torwart Andoni Zubizarreta on Saturday against England (Nederlag 0-1 in London) with 126 foreign games.
Casillas will play against the three-colour team today and Spain will play a new record of 127 foreign games.
Xavi Hernández, player of the Barcelona football club, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received a recognition last week from the UEFA, along with others of the Iberian team that had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the central storm of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds also approaches Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He follows Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the sides of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, the left sidestorm Junior Díaz with 48 games and the storm Bryan Ruiz with 45.
There were only five games from over 30: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Those with the least games.
Show less than 30 games in the Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the sides of the national team come on less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even approaching the 20th boundary.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, recorded in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson did not have their debut yet.
Spain's historic gatekeeper is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz shot with nine most gates, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The Quintett attended Costa Rica to his tour to celebrate his twenty-year-old existence
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that is fulfilled"
In the exclusive discussion with Viva, the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give one of its best concerts on the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected to be more than 20 years, but the band assured that a dream would be fulfilled for them when they were playing in Costa Rica.
This assured the bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from Brazil last week from an exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South American part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they appear in the National Stadium from 1930 a.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full copy can be found in La Nación’s online release.
For your costarican fans, a dream comes when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
To play in Costa Rica is a dream that is also fulfilled for us.
This is just the second time we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I've only been for a vacation in Costa Rica. It's such a beautiful country that we'll certainly stay there for a few days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I'm asking you that because the fans of the band are completely devoted, you're experiencing the days before the concert.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing on our side all these years.
We've spent almost 21 years until we arrived in Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting for so long and we're sorry to have used so long until we came here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the largest show of the year.
Doesn't this exercise a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the most great shows we've been showing in the last 21 years have been taking place in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they have made us suitable for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we like to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and are enthusiastic from the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always traveled to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the excellent areas are surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love surfing.
With a look at the tournament, you offered giant shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we do not set any limits either.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that is partly so because we have nine plates and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so that the decision we are going to play is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we have no longer played, we can keep our concentration upright and surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why these songs have fallen us. Otherwise, they could be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, do you find it difficult to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I think that no one of us has imagined to play once in a great rock band, and that also for more than 20 years, which works like a dream.
We also continue to put on this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like ourselves and are enthusiastic about bringing out music.
We have luck to be able to go to the places of the world that we always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the Grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of large bands.
We're well friends with the people of soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement comes from a group of friends.
There is a band from one city back and forth, but it is unusual when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and feel honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw soundgardens on their tour. We are happy to be still friends with all of them and it honors us to be part of this upcoming Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has remained together with the same musicians so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) shot us 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than many bands last.
First, I believe that we all appreciate happy being alive and also care for each other.
We are all close friends, so musical ways have opened, which give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music.
Your relationship with glory has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we grew, it has made us easier to find a balance.
We're sure not to be too often on tournament, because it's too easy to fall this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people came because of the music, this reminds you that you have to watch the music and what they have called into life without being a famous rock star.
What reminders do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed about having used so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an unbelievable man Andy was and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and the band chose to open?
Yes, production sent us videos from several groups and this band really liked us. That's why we are curious to see what Las Robertas live can offer. This will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing he falls into.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
From so many+
Among the first ones I'm in, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists who like me.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunge alive, although it is no longer a fashion appearance?
I think we all do not feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I find this great because it is worth hearing this music and bands like Mudhoney make better music than ever before.
At first, her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that could work somewhat easy. But there are also other songs such as The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they have something positive in themselves.
Both of them came to me the tears when I heard how Ed played them, and they're very dark songs.
I think if you get older and something traumatic happened in your life - e.g. if you lose a family or a friend - your artistic creation and your music and these two songs clearly affect this for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to the hospital for medical investigations
The former president Alberto Fujimori was delivered to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his house doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is arrested 25 years for violation of human rights during his government period (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is four times under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, Congress Member and his personal doctor, told the TV that Fujimori would be investigated in the Peruvian Hospital Instituteo Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas for three days in order to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that his opinion was that Fujimori could be dignified for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want this because he thought he was innocent.
He was operated four times on tongue cancer and lost 18 kilos of weight. Further diseases such as severe erosive gastrointestinalitis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and bleeding problems in the legs, said the doctor.
Fujimori has been located at the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía in September 2007.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squadron of the Peruan army, which was secretly active during his government period.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
A official decree given by the Uruguay President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs starts their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between two countries and discuss political issues of the region
Mujica meets with his Mexican official Felipe Calderón on Wednesday. This will be the highlight of its booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayians living in Mexico.
The meeting of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries", announced the Presidential Office of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica sought Calderón's support as regards the incident with France when the French Head of Government Nicolas Sarkozy set the South American country to a list of tax paradises at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries who still appear as a tax paradise from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and made a request to his ambassador in the European country.
Since November Mexico has chaired the G20, a group consisting of the world's most powerful thresholds and industrial countries. Since January this year there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid the double allocation with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has attempted to speed up the establishment of agreements for exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "green list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which states that not all international standards for cooperation in tax matters have been introduced.
There has been a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay at business level since 2004, which has contributed to growing trade in goods between the two countries.
The interior installer joins the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
For 25 years Super Mario has struggled hardly for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clowns of the evil bosser, but never until now in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo technology.
The game that comes to the store roofs of the world this month has been cut to the properties of the portable console Nintende 3DS, which can be played without a special glass three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure that needs to say how the stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Álvarez, the responsible person for the press specialized in Nintendo in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo that has been developed from the beginning for this console" because until now success articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were already existing title adjustments.
The speaker of Nintendo underlined that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "super Mario 3D country" video game that allows a fast, liquid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "slight" to capture the less scratched users.
Afterwards, experts can turn a "second round" about the various levels of play, which become more and more difficult.
In addition, users can choose between a "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without being victims of the "optical effects" must always be played three-dimensionally.
This trip of Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console, which has no longer been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo twists the fans of the Saga and repeats the success recipe of the last issues: The snurrberry installer needs to overcome chipped platforms with dangers to free the princess Peach.
However, the player struggles with news in the movements, the environment, the clothing and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom carries for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would take place the delivery of the former governor Alfonso Portillo, so that in the United States he would be responsible for the conspiracy of money laundering of $70 million.
So the process ends with the US's request for delivery of Portillo so that it can be put in court there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of jurisdiction and government, taking into account the fact that a decision-making court had already arranged the delivery.
He emphasized that he did not intervene in court decisions during his government and made all the requests for delivery which he was informed of.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is delivered for murder and serious injuries, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloms is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are expelled for the condemnation of the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be delivered if its legal situation is clarified in Guatemale and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was released for the resignation of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his government period. This negotiation preceded the delivery, but the minister objected and reconsidered the case.
Trinyove has helped 6000 young people who are threatened by social exclusion
The organisation was invited to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Assistance Organization have resulted in important results: In this quarterly century, 6000 young people were supported by socially threatened people to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, the over hundred jobs created for this social group will come.
On the occasion of the anniversary yesterday, at an event in the former work buildings of Fabra i Coats, who participated in more than 300 people, the balance was drawn.
Trinyove was launched in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
On yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu, many responsible bodies and institutions participated in cooperation with the Association during these 25 years.
Participation of political representatives from different directions to election times proved the inpartiality of the work done by Trinyove.
Besides the President of the General (Parlament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol attended the celebrations of former Socialist Ministers of Education Ernest Maragall and former Mayor and currently the left-green Council of Ricard Goma.
The Great Hall of Fabra i Coats also visited the present Catalonian Minister for Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas emphasized that Trinyove was called into life in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complicated, but he added that the work that has been done is "a good basis".
For the president of the Generalitat, Trinyove is an example that knows to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the association and the work he does," he explained.
The occupied house in which Giant Partys were organized was cleared
The owners of the house had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the Balmes Road No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve householders left the building yesterday afternoon without resistance.
All indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the House No. 51 on the road Balmes have found an end.
Twelve people left the building that they had illegally occupied yesterday afternoon and organised huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The room was arranged on judicial order without police intervention.
After the space, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now the access will be checked," confirmed the household manager.
The housekeepers who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical plant and part of the water supply. They had also painted the walls and left all types of waste, especially dosing with alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which took up to two days and driven the tenants to despair.
Besides the building, there is a discothek, Balmes 51, which also had damage to it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained Europe Press that her business had dropped by 80% since the beginning of the household occupation.
The owners of the discothek pointed out that the housekeepers made their unfair competition because they sold the drinks to three euros while they cost 10 euros in the discothek.
In addition, the owner of the leisure room had been displayed by the neighbors because of rest disturbance, while, according to her statement, noise was not touched by the visitors of the disco, but by the housekeepers, and in particular by the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and, according to the indignant neighbors' statements, they became increasingly more and longer in recent weeks.
The responsible discothek explained that the harassment was so big that it agreed with the owner of the building that it would not have to pay for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (Stadtic Police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints from the neighbors over the last few weeks.
The Chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - Volkspartei) at the City Council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, asked last week to clear the building immediately and to tackle the problems of civil society and the fall of the district.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that in the last few months the housekeepers had been forced in all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments. In some, there were even thieves.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to the unpunishedness and to deal with the associal acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalonian police.
At 3:30 p.m., the police approached Montral No. 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had noticed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or Berg?
The architects, apart from the disputes about the honors, agree with the invitation to tender.
The urban invitation to the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the peak of Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its shame writing on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the downturn of the CMB in 1987, the park was in the eyes of many again to the upper boundary of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few that spread not in the north-south directive, but up (the mountains) and down (more).
Collserolas' classification as a natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park now served Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogiber.
So far, when the city issued a giant invitation, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access stores to Collserola.
No doubt a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either it is, or someone has to put gates on the country.
The question is of itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The invitation is not only from an organizational perspective, but also from a reflection on the city the conversation theme in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is already almost a recursive topic that two members of this old occupied box that meets in the elevator can take back on.
And precisely this fact provides the substance for one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have acquired the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The invitation to tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "is it necessary" to talk about the "Front on the mountains" after the attack on the coast, in so far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been carried out on the green apples.
"You should go from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things because he is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect, for which the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap" in itself: it must not be "presenced as access to a park, but as a limitation of areas in which to be treated."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal as a "intellectual challenge", which poses "some dangers".
Dangers due to the "unsecurity that brings the formation of a public space today" following the experiences of the 1980s that had their "song of swiftness" in the field of the Forum.
The first fear is its own limitation to what can be built.
"Inclusion of something always means to set the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning instruments, because the present [which refers to the General Metropolitano (PGM) plan] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who keeps closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go towards Barcelona" for purely topographical reasons.
Modol reminds us that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola that should not "run on the deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration that it has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from first moment".
In addition, he notes that the nearness of the mountain to the city of the guide letter, which enables the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "decision" on whether this technical profile should be a tool for the multidisciplinary teams called into life ("just the right", he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question is complex in the heading of this article, as in the terms of tendering there is no global view of Collserola: "There were 16 competitions in cross-section," he says, "on the axis Mountain-Meer. But there are no long-sized perspectives that view the area in its entirety."
This has at least resulted in his participation in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate.
It believes that the city should absolutely ensure that the strip is equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt throughout its length, which is a soft transition between city and green zones.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the officer of the Casino Red freed the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey from the process that is conducted against him because of suspicious oppression.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the officer of the Casino Red forgave him before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which leads the trial against the Brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for oppression.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of the Casino Red, published a number of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is to be seen, who suspectly forces him to pay a sum of money, so that the city administration will approve the secret operation of the Wetthaus.
After the penalty announcement, the State Attorney opened a criminal proceedings against the brother of the panist mayor, which was arrested for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of the Ministry of Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was brought to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place, he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministry of Público had rejected the crimes due to the crime and organised crimes.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereyta's Cadereyta arrest station because he suspected the owners of the Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he remained only a few hours in the central security district, as murder threats against him were present.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as an insassess of the urban prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, Jorge Yánez, the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court of the District, was assigned to him a detention regulation, which noted that after the nearly two months of investigation, there is sufficient evidence to speak guilty of Jonás for payment of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the Wetthaus to open it in return.
On Monday, the Senator of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez asked Judge José Luis Pecina to execute the punishment to the Brother of the Mayor, so he will be put on foot in the next hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of Ministerio Público, García Gómez, asked whether he had corrected the damage and who the owner of the Wetthaus had declared his forgiveness. However, the lawyer rejected the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is spoken freely; there are also no objections to the proceedings, nor is any compensation required.
Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released after the hearing of the Senator of the Wetthaus at 15.50 o'clock.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to San Nicolás de los Garza city prison to tell Jonás that he had been released and his case would be put to the documents.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the plane accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake and other seven people died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the investigation about the accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people died indicate that the helicopter with its entire uncontaminated structure is struck directly against the ground without the pilot could have launched an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome mentioned, Secretary for Communication and Transport that the pilot had confirmed before the start that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing in 25 meters of height had contact with trees, while the helicopter lost the trumpet, seems to point out that the helicopter had several soil contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the conditions for transporting the personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found in the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"In the search no plane parts were found in other places, the impact covered the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 insassesses, so he fulfilled all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area shows a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present it is priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but these may take several months, perhaps even a year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aeroplanes and Assistance Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from Estado Mayor Presidential had fled with travel speed and the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the breakdown."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, included six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Visibility speed:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of the sighting flight. This means that the team must have had sufficient views during the flight and on the ground.
Conditions of weather:
The AICM recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the continuation toward the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deeply hanging clouds were raised.
Selected routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the team had selected a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Tal.
Crafting point:
The rebelling coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Possibly, before the crash, there has not been any loss of control over the plane or a deviation from the flight route.
Distribution of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to the present date indicates that the helicopter had been swallowed in straight and side direction.
The pattern of the scattered flight rest makes it suspicious that the helicopter was screwed up on the ground with its unleavened structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane offer at the accident site neither fire nor explosion.
The last results of the investigation indicate several soil contacts.
In the local investigations, plane parts were found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The area is discounted and shows a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter might have had several soil contacts.
After a minuzious search in an area beyond the unlocked area at the accident site, no dispersed plane parts could be found, which strengthens the assumption that the uncontaminated plane structure had been suspended against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to invent the gene for fatty liability
The Mexico Social Assurance Institute conducts a research project to invent the gene for fatty life in children and adolescents supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituteo Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS announced that there is a research project to discover the gene for fatty liability in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of fatty life in childhood and youth" with which genetic brands are to be found in connection with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (the Department for Medical Research, the focus on Biochemie) at the Hospital de Especialidads del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrient specialists and social workers was built.
This team is supported by specialists and students at the Instituteo Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interesters can come to the sports places of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday at 8 a.m. tests are performed with children and adolescents.
He emphasized that the study started at the sports site of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and has been continued since 8 October on the sports site of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México).
When the target has been reached from 500 to 600 investigators, the study is continued at Independencia's sports site (in the south of the capital district) and completed on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He stated that the purpose of the study is to learn the factors and the role of genetics in the development of fatty mortality and the identification of risk factors of mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he stated that it was sought that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 years should be filled with the consent and under the supervision of their parents with food-related questionnaires.
They will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of disease to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or kidney impairment.
In addition, he argued that during the said Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, taille number), their blood pressure control and blood levels such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (experiment of gene identification related to fatty in childhood).
Cruz López stressed that this study would be carried out due to the concern of healthcare professionals about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in nearly six years the proportion of fatty boys increased by 77 percent and that of the girls with fattyness by 47 percent. The overweight has also increased dramatically," stressed the IMSS specialist.
He said that the search for genetic marks was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differs from the other peoples.
He indicated that an (e) Mexican (in) averaged to 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent of European and 5 percent African descent, reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
Generally, he explained that the genetics of fatty liability are incapable of burning out the excess of energy taken to us (calories) so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher stated that the direct benefit for the participants was in a comprehensive study of the children in which it would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or fattyness.
It would even investigate the presence of dark skin leaks in the neck and in the inner arm (akanthosis), which would indicate the probability of metabolism and diabetes in the pre-stadium.
All information would be treated confidentially and sent to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measuring results and suggest changes in lifestyle that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for overweight, fattyness and other chronic diseases: a lack of movement in everyday life, the most time of the day before television and use of means of transport, rather than walking short paths.
The high intake of calories, i.e. increased consumption of sugar drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc.) together with high fat and protein intake and the genetics to be analysed in this research project.
Asphalt by the UNAM prevents stroke holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM University of Mexico, developed asphalts modified with polymers to make the mixture resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs of the streets were taken into account, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 holes if the raintime in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (Stadt of the Valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Najera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warned and assured that when the exposure and maintenance of the asphalt layer is adequately estimated, the number of strokes will be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Special Slagholes", which he held to Chemistry at the end of the International Year, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a similar mixture of asphalt, but that is a greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Mrera Nájera believed that this type of modified asphalt in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road cover and thus avoid the occurrence of strokes.
He explained that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon compound of which partly has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called maltene. Together they give to the road bearing its characteristic tealastic behaviour.
The thaelastic behaviour of the asphalt means that at high temperatures of nearly 180°C it is like a liquid, at 120°C it is very soft and fast fast at 50°C while it becomes breached at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the streets is not equivalent, but changes on one day, depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemistry engineer explained.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico City have a largely flexible street cover consisting of six layers of material, of which the last three asphalts included.
Between the upper layers, there was a sliding layer of asphalt that was bathed from small, in asphalt and then solided stones.
Each single stone of this cast layer, had been barbed in asphalt.
When the vehicles are moving on and powers are generated, this layer enables a good distribution of powers in the street.
"If it was modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," said the chemical engineer.
"Over the castle," he explained, "is a last layer designed, the so-called barbecue layer consisting of tiny stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since these layers are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a greater mechanical power than the cast layer and they have to produce moulding.
The person who receives and distributes most of the powers, the bearing layer also needs an appropriate thickness and the material it consists of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially moisture and temperature fluctuations, are further important factors to consider, above all the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the cast layer.
When the ground is moisturized, water enters the layer and is only difficult to get out again. This causes a deviation of all the layers of the street bearing and resulting in the occurrence of strokes.
When a hole arises, he said, "will first be carried off the deck layer, while the deck layer is only affected after that. But the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be maintained in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of strokes. Therefore, the thickness of any layer of the road cover must always be proportionate to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this system is complied with to avoid frequent seizures.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research work was still waiting, for example through asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, with which the strokes were easily repaired and without the use of high temperatures.
What was missing by the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that did not affect Melina Ramirez Serna’s crown of Miss Columbia.
El Valle gets his 14th mistitle.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went out empty when giving the crown to Miss Columbia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with standing on the winner podium, putting a silver crown and the band she depicts as a new Miss Colombia.
With the result of this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the Zeder, the Departamento is already joined by 14 Misstitels and Melina to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in hands. Among the proclaimed misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many today ask themselves is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the defeat of a great favorite who had shown in every presentation that she had everything to be the new Miss Columbia. She had been chosen to the queen of the police and to Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles that had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor that is decisive to the Jury's decision to designate it for the first miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "What book has influenced you most and why?" which Martín Murillo Gómez had asked her by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questionnaire:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in the literature, I think it's a way to civilize itself, at last I think that the book, which was most characterized for my childhood, 'The little prince' is a very deep-going book.
At present I read `Schuld und Söhne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Leidenschaften'.
An answer, which was in little opposition, first of all because of the term 'civilize' and second, because she had not explained concretely how each of her books had influenced her.
But after the ceremony, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what needs to happen.
And for all people: please read a little "The little prince". It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that El Valle's favorite is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the preferred who had invented all the applauses and had received all the prices in advance (Gastronomie-Wettbewerb Oster, audience vote on the best hand-circumcised costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealousy, which the queen stressed, which couldn't shine on the stage."
And this was noticed at her first idea in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and at their two elevators at the crown celebration.
Though she was safe in both, she lacked the strength and swiftness of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the Como en casa program at the Channel RCN, said that the fact that Melina was crowned as a Miss, "hows that the candidate who wins most prices during the competition will not finally become queen".
In addition, Valle went off to the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about its interest in social work, which is finally the essential of the national beauty competition.
It will have its reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty they were looking for a woman who engaged in the social affairs of her country.
"Success alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the body and focus on social feelings, that she had been working on projects before taking part in competition," she explained.
It is also wondered that Valle sins with her defects of the Derriere and the fibrosis that was noted to her in the stomach area. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for "natural beauty" with a healthy body, good diet and responsible physical work.
The trainer of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body that it would be better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the abdomen, which was fairly hard to notice for me, pressed her score on the last day."
In the meantime, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believed that the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and this place had to pay it."
Because of this prize, which is for the first time forgiven by the National Beautiful Competition, a grievous prediction that would be true in the night after the appearance of the bathing suit. It was concealed that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price in order not to let her come into the enjoyment of the crown.
No matter whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina has arrived from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at the appointment of the National Beautiful Competition in one of the international competitions.
However, as one of the queens who had escaped the crown for Cartagena, she will enter the story.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went into history when the man identified Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a lofoscopist of the investigation unit of the State Attorney (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Forces of Columbia) by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had a ready service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he settled to Valle over and after completion of the necessary courses, he specialized himself in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to reibning, i.e. the hand and foot surfaces.
During the week of use against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something big expected him.
On Friday night he flew to Cauca in the helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspect was that one of the man who had led the oldest Guerrilla in the world could be. Therefore he should take the ten-finger prints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached the place where the body was in, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no bart, was dressed like a farmer in the area, had no glasses and was much thiner.
But fingerprints aren't lying.
Armed with a lumber, ink, a plant cell and a pocket lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those on the printing sheet.
He had rightly seen it was "Alfonso Cano".
The same night this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for telling the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Search for tracks
For a daktyloscope from Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was very important.
Many people don't know our work.
The Daktylos copy is a precise science without error ratio, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations in murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many criminals present false certificates or do not have any.
We'll take them the fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to pull a piece of wall out of a house at a steal, because the thief had just stood up in this place with his hand when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Wands are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate to take fingerprints, but in this case we could take the print of the whole hand and identify the criminal who had participated in several thiefs," he recalled.
The use of fingerprints can also be discharged or charged with murder suspects.
A dead person surrounded by snaps has recently been found.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be suspicious, and in fact a fingerprint agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it will be linked to the place where the crime has been committed.
A daktyloscopist of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
If they appear, a plant cell or a band is used for taking.
Afterwards, the prints are sent to Asif, that is the criminal database, or to the staff office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without evidence," said the CTI expert.
He said not everything was like it was represented in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is, which shines, not all you touch is a fingerprint.
However, it can be used if you make an appropriate comparison.
The "employments" invite the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators assembled in tents on the Zuccotti Square.
Most of them came to the space order and switched its location to a nearby park.
On that Tuesday, the members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement asked the authorities of New York when they tried again to join the Manhatte Square with a judicial order after they had been cleared from the place in the morning and had tried to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators were forced together before the Zuccotti Square, which they wanted to enter with a judicial order which allowed the "emotionals" to re-tell in this place. However, another part of the movement held at the space order and occupied a park further north in the city where it came to nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the place, we will find ourselves in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the motion "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray explained that the answer of the "employers" to the space of her tent camp, which was directly appointed by Michael Bloomberg, the Mayor of New York, came before court, where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the violent space of the place and approved the tent.
In addition, the "emotionals" occupied a new park that is located at the crossing of the centrally located Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue all close to the entrance to the Dutch tunnel, New York and New Jersey, and is property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least one hour, but afterwards the police met and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray couldn't give precise numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had also seen several journalists with gloves.
The organization assured that hundreds of people had been found in this place, where also a departure of religious leaders had taken place as signs of their support to the members of the movement and to communicate with the police.
In the meantime, the Zuccotti Square (a terrain in Private Eigentum) remains closed in the expectation of a judicial hearing which is still in place for this Tuesday, with a view to analysing the legality of the room held in the morning.
Some of the demonstrants driven by the place carried photos of this judicial order and distributed them. They even gave them some policemen who guarded the place, resulting in "some small collapses", as Bray reported, who had indicated that some policemen had hit demonstrators.
The judicial instruction prohibits the authorities to leave members of Occupy Wall Street and the application of "states adopted after the occupy and prohibiting the demonstrators to return to the park with their tents and other things they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg clarifies before the press that, due to this judicial order, the reopening of the place for public transport and demonstrators had been lifted. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to rebuild with tents and sleep bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the space of the Zuccotti place in the morning, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the demonstrators were "dismissing the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to space the place because he had "converted to a place where people were not to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm other people" because "some businesses had received threats" and the residents feared "for their quality of life".
"The room in the morning grey was awful and shows that Bloomberg is essentially interested in protecting the financial interests and not in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the speaker of the movement who accused the mayor of "not to respect the freedom of press".
The responsible ones of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they thought about organising "great actions" for Thursday, together with municipal organisations and trade unions, to remember the two months that the protests have taken since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimmer in "Baywatch", rabbits at "Playboy", the wife of the rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actor and model will be the Virgin Mary during a Christmas broadcast of the Canadian television.
Today, the private TV channel CTV announced that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (Balladensänger) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December and will hack up a very special virgin Mary's life.
CTV today distributed pictures of the television program, where Anderson - also for the dissemination of the Internet of a self-circumcised porno, where she appears as a virgin Mary with a puppe in the shot that Jesus is supposed to represent, together with her former husband, the killer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee.
In the scene Peters, a well-known Canadian comic of Indian origin, recently worked as a leader at the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" mission by Charlie Sheen as a son of Jesus.
The Christmas program of CTV is not only based on Anderson and Peters, also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato at the end of March in Buenos Aires, and which is not far away from this controversy.
On one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently called the North American Kim Kardashian "Hure".
Japan is reborn after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of the free fall from the beginning of March.
Since March last, the Japanese economy had been paralyzed, which remained in the recovery after the destructive earthquake, which invaded a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced as the Second World War.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo evaluated the damage to $300 000, a hit that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic conditions.
After three quarters of cases, the data on the gross domestic product used from July to September finally to complete this chapter: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the rate calculated to the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan starts the financial year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since January to March 2010.
The rehabilitation can be explained partly by the machine sale for the reconstruction of the areas destroyed by earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the decrease by 0.9% for capital investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of irresistible increases.
Nevertheless, the real change in the Japanese economy is not solely based on keynsian attacks that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has been awakened especially thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, inspired by growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and recreational activities.
The Stigma of Yen
Tokyo has trusted in the domestic market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - escaped into one of the "advanced currencies" of investors flying before the debt crisis in the euro area and the tough forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that is like a grave stone on the accounts of the export companies.
With a harder currency, the products in abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the major technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony brought their weak business results back to the notation of Yen from July to September.
While markets continue to defeat the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains alert.
"You have to take care of the continuing risks, for example the worsening of some foreign economies, the effects of floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of Yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
The perspectives are really not very exciting.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) stated that most Member States had shown more clear signs of slowing the economic development in September.
The indicator predicting the turning points of the world economy revealed that the biggest economic potential would have drawn the brakes.
For he was sank by four tenths to loose 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro area is even below this average, which is 100, after it has dropped by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens resumes doubts
Papadimos says that the savings measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums at the height of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece continues to wander in the labyrinth that results from the major European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of political forces is slowly proved by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days of his appointment might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new savings measures and would not at all withdraw his demand for new elections at the date of 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October", Papadimos insisted yesterday on opening a parliamentary debate which will reach its peak tomorrow with the confidence voting for the new government.
The first initiatives are a package of 24 employment promotion programmes, reform of the disciplinary law for officials and new measures against tax relief.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not rule out the doubts about his attitude: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge from the EU and the IMF, the organism who had to unlock the 8000 million that are urgently needed to Athens.
But yesterday, the European Commission, who is still irritated because of the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, again confirmed that its demand would not be reluctant: economic assistance would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the most important Greek parties would sign "a clear written agreement not as soon as possible".
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, stated that the inspectors of Troika were "very soon" coming back to Athens to discuss with the new government, "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth section" of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knee has for a while more threads.
Queen Sofia: "This are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "predominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the role of smallest funding worldwide".
Yesterday, Queen Sofia of Spain reminded me that in the last two decades Spain has developed a second donor worldwide for this funding for international cooperation. This "Wesen" is based on the fact that it is a "instruction for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind on the basis of trust in human beings".
Yesterday, the Queen devoted the fifth World Summit on Small Credits in Valladolid. She was convinced that there would be "no doubts" that this type of business would be "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the millennial goals set by the United Nations until 2015 and "in particular the goal of the number of persons living with income of less than one dollar a day, that is below the "armut limit".
Spain "continues working" on the expansion of the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it performs this task responsible," said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will be made from the summit, which takes to Thursday, "the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" will be guaranteed as the principal beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "resisting many challenges."
The summit on small credits is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for "two basic objectives".
The queen stated that it would be sought that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these households will exceed the poverty limit.
The conception of small credits goes back in Spain and the rest of the world on the "initiated way" by Muhammad Yunus, which Queen Sofia judges as a "Act of Justice and Recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as a "awesome idealist who has prescribed the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet the local loan strategy.
This experience followed a year later the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings at the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we have been able to observe a continual development," the Queen whose commitment to this project gave her the assessment as "Family Noble Head" in Valladolid yesterday and as a "Press speaker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by animating the attendants to participate in the debate and looking for solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Command"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "a ethical command" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, it emphasized that it was a mistake to bind development aid at times of economic booms, for it is a "durable commitment".
Jiménez was of the opinion that small credits were a "heartest and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty", and that the governments of the industrial states now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and would not be likely to allow the solidarity of the crisis to be a victim.
For Spain, small credits are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, regretted "the success", "marginalized" people who are always standing in front of closed doors" "hoping" and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the attendants in a city that opens "their gates, concealed by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to choose the EU presidents on the basis of general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14, Leipzig, left for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian-Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally set out in the programme, but has been implemented in the autumn, especially in order to satisfy those activists who are considering the government policy on Greeks today and perhaps Italy to be late tomorrow.
The European Commission's Presidency request, proposed by the Bureau, was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates had only nine voted against, ten had abstained from the vote.
The several minutes of standing Ovation, which, first of all, due to their intervention insurances Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble, had no doubt since the three European financial ministers.
The main idea of the Chancellor - as well as the requests - is the following: the response to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also there "new million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be expressed by a change in the Lisbon Treaty, which strengthens the control of the European Union, as regards the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, but also in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voting" to give Europe a face".
However, this is, in any case, one of the proposals adopted by the Congress which were clearly Wolfgang Schuble Pate.
Surely it is little likely that the 47 agree quickly on this revolution: Groβ-British is the case rejecting, and the leaders of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestone is laid.
Similarly, in an overwhelming majority, the delegates have rejected the proposal for the weighting of each country in the Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of the individual economies, which obviously led to the enlargement of Germany's position.
Consequently, the Chancellor, considered to resolute the climate within its party, has strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has no longer tried to win her convention at the expense of the smaller countries or the countries in Europe in difficulty, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European application for the importance of the "German-French Friendship" devotes a section, Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was at the heart of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact one of the most degrading defeat of the Napoleon army.
What does fraud represent in the case of illness messages?
Following family aid, UMP and government are now taking on the disease notifications.
Nicolas Sarkozy will meet in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15, in order to seek a family support fund and present a speech on the issue of combating social fraud and economic dependence of the state - which has always been returning since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the efforts to undertake the economy in a harsh trial, but on the other hand, it is not less prejudice to a axis of the right presidency campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee disease notifications.
First of all with budgetary objectives: the government advocates the introduction of a fourth Karenz Day before taking into account a disease notification to employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the wage of four days without granting the specific company, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos" threatens to raise anger, would help to put 280 million euros in place.
And the more symbolic character of another measure: allowing the state officials an unpaid carence day in the case of disease (for now, in contrast to the three carent days in the private sector, there is no carence deadline for them).
While these issues are in the debate, the majority also facilitate the new fraud topics, aiming at the abuse associated with work absence.
"Controls will be more important, and they will also be reimbursed if this is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November, against the CRL microphone.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of disease notification seem a little unproportionate.
In fact, this has been subject to permanent observation and political offensives, which have been most frequently fruitful since 2002.
The French are not more often sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, first of all, we are in the country-wide numbers.
According to CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid in 2006.
In 2008, the financial research and documentation institute in the health sector represented 5% of the health expenditure by 11.3 billion euros.
This amount accounted for 46% in relation to maternity leave, work accidents and 54% in terms of disease leave, which is 6.2 billion euros.
And then 2.5% health expenditure.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, in 2010, the French received only 14.5 sickness days compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
A mean value that distorts certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, the website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40,000 interviewed French workers did not have taken a single health day.
Another study recorded this time by the health insurance reveals that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
In comparison with their European neighbours, French workers are no longer incapable of working than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted by two researchers of the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (based on disease or otherwise) was occillated in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in the case of illness notifications represents a diminishing low share of black work.
With regard to the controversy, only a weak outmade is achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 leads to systmatic controls in disease notifications which exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university for training and training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 realized, short-term disease notifications, which were in 37,050 cases, were unjustified or too long."
In the systematically controlled disease notification cases of more than 45 days, less than 1.2 million 11% were considered "unadjusted or unjustified" cases, which are 132,000.
A total of 169 000" unjustified" cases of several million workers who have claimed a disease notification.
A number representing only a weak outmade, for example, the black work.
According to the UMP Member Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax gains per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily remuneration, and thus much more than the defraudation of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adaptation programme to capture its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced to Parliament, in addition to the fact that those of his government from the Union did not have enough hundred days to fulfil this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to boost the economy, we need support for our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Head of Government in its first public speech in opening the debate on Parliament's trust vote on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro-Gipfel meeting on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the euro area is at stake, as it added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the country's national deficit by 9% of the gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new savings
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, head of the right wings, had agreed to the measures already approved in respect of an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but presended that his party would not be prepared to obtain additional savings.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of his party's new democracy.
He had declared himself prepared to reduce budget deficits and debts, as well as to fight against waste, but it was hostile to any policy which would undermine economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, with economic and monetary tasks entrusted by the EU Commissioner who had prevented IWF and the EU from release the necessary loan over EUR 8 billion without a written guarantee to all parties on their support for the proposed measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and he would not sign anything under pressure of Auβen.
Euthanasia and accompanying free death must be legalised, so an expert body
Canadians live in refusal of death, as a report of the Royal Society of Canada shows
The body explained that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors cooperated in the field of painlinder treatment to prepare the best pain-sensitive means, and this also beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal against death.
Only 9% of the Canadians are actually able to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and meet dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which was involved in six experts linked to various fields of science, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way to allow accompanying suicide and euthanasia, where this choice takes place, in patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
As a record, the experts quote a recently published survey of the independent company EU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the earthball.
Although Canada has placed itself on the 10th rank, the study notes that "the medical care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the subject of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians do not have access to painful means, so the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report to us.
And despite the majority of the Canadians' wish to die at home, however, at last 68.6% of them die in the hospital.
From all over the country, the rate of 86% of deaths in the hospital is the highest in Quebec.
In the tough question of Euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions which are against the position of the federal government, which has already been said, not to want to make any changes to the criminal law regarding Euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
However, according to the experts who have likewise inspected all those countries whose approach to Euthanasia and accompanying suicide has legalized or discriminated, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would draw on use of Miβ in their application, i.e. the practice of Euthanasia or accompanying suicide from incompetent or non-consuming persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are addressed in the countries where Euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalised, as Jocelyn Downie, a subscriber of the report, confirmed at a telecommunications conference yesterday.
"Euthanation is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Also accompanyed suicide is practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadian Approves the Euthanation
We confront ourselves with the fact that, according to an angus-reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of the Canadians had already been refined in favour of Euthanasia, since they believe that they allow people to remedy their suffering at the end of their life course.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalisation of Euthanasie does not result in telling the message that the life of older or disabled people has less value.
As regards those who have already exercised a accompanying suicide, 41% of the respondents believe that they should not be persecuted criminally.
As regards the maintenance or adjustment of the funds in patients, the situation is less clear, according to the rapporteurs of the report.
It also points out in its recommendation list that the criminal law should indicate that the suspension of the funds for which a legal refusal has been granted, should not be regarded as criminal.
The expert body also calls on health professionals to be trained in the task of reducing the resources at the end of life and to fear this without criminal persecution.
The body explained that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to painlinder treatment in order to prepare the best pain relief agents, and this also beyond cancer cases.
Lastly, the body insists on considering the resources already used in the Canadian institutions for healthcare to reduce pain or loss of life, at least because they were not used to reduce physical pain as well as the Euthanasia.
Reservation of other experts
Some experts in the legal field of health have already tabled reservations regarding the conclusions of the Canadian Royal Society expert report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, called the position of reporting experts, among other things, "extrem" because it does not set any limits on euthanation practices in the end phase.
"This opens the pitches for a situation in which everyone who is tired and older than 18 years of age is to ask another person to help him with his suicide," said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the rapporteurs of the report seemed to put the individual's own responsibility on all other values involved in the social sector of society.
Well, he says, there are "directions and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, also expressed "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which she titulated as "Pro-Euthanation Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports concerning the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where Euthanasia and accompanying suicide are legalised, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls President Assad for the resignation of power
Damascus pranges a "complott" to
Syria is apparently more isolated
The Partisans Baschar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Auβen Ministry.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria Baschar al-Assads, which, thanks to Russia's support and a "complot" against the country, has increased yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League excluded Syria, the European Union intensified its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbouring countries, had taken a position in favour of a withdrawal from President Assad.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan yesterday was the official Arab Prime Minister, who had asked President Baschar al-Assad to put down his office in Syria, in which the fifty civilians and members of the government were killed.
"Legge Baschar the interest of his country in the heart, so he would depart, but also he should create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomat chief Ahmet Davutoglu had complained on the other hand that since the beginning of the year, the Turkish regime had not been conquered by success.
"Those in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and are not able to satisfy this must go," he said in an example of Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking a steadily roaring attitude.
On the other hand, the United States greeted the "intense of the consensus against Assad and the Machenships of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and of the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and the countries such as Turkey have made an increasingly sharper tone in terms of repression in Syria," says Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government have died in the Dar'a region in the south of Syria, so the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced OSDH.
According to this NGO, two other civilians had died in the confronted city of Hom in "Scotting Changes and heavy bombing attacks on Jobar".
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Auβenhandelsminister Walid al-Muallim was still the view that the country's taxes to the end of the crisis.
By the way, he has reacted with emphasis on the conclusion of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his tasks, which represents his assessment after a "threatening step".
Syria would not be surrendered," he added, under the confession that "the complots of Syria would fail".
Following the decision on the suspension of Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Auβen Commerce Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken in favour of the dispatch of UN observers to protect civilians from repressions of the regime, after embracing him into his "Paranoia".
A planned new meeting of the League is planned for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for crisis-new rise decided on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the camped cities, as well as the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
The Russian Auβen Minister Sergej Lawrow classified the decision of the Arab League yesterday as "incorrect" in order to prevent any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis expiry plan.
Italy
Monti calls on the markets to be patient and Italy to prepare for sacrifice
Mario Monti, the future Italian Head of Government, demanded a little more time from the markets to form its staff and implement a programme that calls for "offers" to recover the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the government of Berlusconi.
The former EU Commissioner had held negotiations with the political parties yesterday before today's meeting of trade unions and employers' associations.
It was his task to invoke a cabinet to Parliament that is relatively strictly composed of external technologies.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the discussions, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Members, had, on the other hand, waited for Mario Monti to make a statement of confidence to Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The meetings will be summarised in the presentation presented by M. Monti, which will undoubtedly reach from a dozen ministers to the Head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervosity in the stock markets and obligatory markets demanded their time.
In 'a democracy there are certain deadlines' to prepare a government as well as a government programme, he stressed that it is "safe that the markets will show clarity and understanding".
His order by the President was greeted by the markets, but the unrest had increased again, especially after an unexpected industrial production decrease in the euro area in September.
The official Prime Minister should establish a staff consisting of mainly technologies, although he had stressed that he would also like to include "politicals".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he appreciated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Members, the new government should receive Parliament's confidence until Friday.
M. Monti has been committed since its operation to work in all urgent terms in the sense of the objective of making Italy a 'new protagonist' in Europe.
A speaker of Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change itself, taking into account the new government."
The EU, who is convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budget compensation in 2013 despite the savings plans set up in these last months, has in particular requested new approaches.
Emma Marcegaglia"Chefin of the heads of Italy, which will meet at Monti on Tuesday, also focuses on the need for economic acceleration"as a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficient identification figures".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and its independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "Epoche change" in Italy after 17 years"Berlusconism; the "Professor" symbolizes the "requisite of trustworthiness" as well as a "other Italy", according to the directors.
The big unknown in this is the long-life of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent preferred elections, since Italy has arrived for 200 billion euros from April 2012.
Russian scientists help the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatschslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a bombing capsule used with a nuclear weapon, so on Monday confirmed a nuclear-risk NGO.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report by the International Agency for Nuclear Safety AIEA and other documents from this UN Agency to investigate this scientist.
The AIEA had announced its "intimate concern" last week in view of a possible "military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents since the ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked in a Soviet military nuclear center in Cheljabinsk (Ural) since the beginning of the 1960s for over three decades and has been involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he should have left the centre to establish a company in Kiev which produces "Nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then participated in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned strong evidence that the Iranian development of a nuclear explosive system was supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only at the most in this technology but also, as a member of the Agency announced, his entire professional career had worked directly on this technologies in the military nuclear programme of its country of origin.'
Anti-Islamic crimes and delicts have increased by 50%
The crimes and delicts directed against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racist or religiously motivated violence crimes, according to the FBI statistics published on Monday in the same period, have either slightly decreased or increased slightly.
According to these data, the total number of violence committed against Muslims had increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is 49% in 2010, while 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in Jews' crimes and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total "hass motivated crime" has risen to 6.628 cases in very weak maβe, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences in motivated crimes, says the FBI.
"After a decay in 2009, it is alarming to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the Human Rights Organization emphasised first."The increase in anti-Islamian violence is particularly significant," added the organisation in a communication.
"Human Rights First had for a long time stressed that the violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be regarded as a serious legal conviction against human rights," added Paul Legendre, an organizational responsible.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these transgressions," he added, assuming that this could be done in improving the political attitude toward the "hass crime".
The "hass crime" represents the inheritance of civil rights in the US federal law.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings in order to punish violent acts directed against race, skin color, religion or descendants and now also involve crimes of sexual belonging.
Twitter walks the platform and looks more and more like Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter has introduced changes in the presentation of its platform on Monday, in order to enable its users to especially observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service more similar to those of Facebook.
The new tab "activity" and another" name enables better readable live to complete the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose news ("Tweets") you follow and follow your messages.
This enables you to find out whether these allow to track their news, whether they subscribe to new posts, favour certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday" in August at a small percentage of users", the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner stated before the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for his little instinctive functioning, enrolled with a little esotherically encouraging text (RT to referenced repetition of the contribution of another person). followfriday pour recommander de suivre unautre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur of the initiative, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniment plus comparable a celuiable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users discussed this innovation via certain "Tweets" via the Internet.
"This is unusual, pressing and equals too much Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function" activity will help me to follow certain elements of my flux-twitter better", proved @danykron stream.
Austria
Entry into the Constitution of a Golden Budget Rule
On Tuesday, the government of the great social-democratic/Christian coalition in Austria decided to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and to avoid any degradation of rating agencies in the top of Austria (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who had announced this decision on the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public state debt is 74.6%, i.e. far above the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty of 60%, but clearly below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's payment capacity was not reduced to AA+ on a strike, we would have to pay three billion euros further each year," Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Canzler and Christian-Democratic Auβen Minister argued.
Austria also calls for the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the Eurozone of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had at that time demanded the introduction of a reduction in public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public account balance into the Constitution or by the adoption of a equivalent law.
The measures taken by the Austrian Government are similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country that had included such a "regulatory" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (BIP) each year, but from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the State should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, while regional states should have balanced households as well as communities.
The aim is to eliminate budget debts in the 2020/21 horizon under the 60% criteria set out in the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on monetary markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese official force would again intervene on the monetary markets if the Yen would continue to rise.
"If we find an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of Yen, we will intervene as well as we did the last time," explained M. Noda in Senate.
On Tuesday the Yen was again close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive Yen against dollars to reduce the Japanese currency value, which has been in charge of a new record value since 1945 compared to the dollar.
Yen, however, has regularly increased, baptized by purchases of investors who view Yen as the "advance value" in these uncertain times of world economic decline and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has fallen under 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro is under the symbolic lat of 105 yen near the levels that had struck the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar recorded around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This strawfire of the Japanese devise harms the exports of the Archipelago, as it consumes the costs of the "made in Japan" products and reduces the income value withdrawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into national currency.
"Japan struggles after earthquake and the Tsunami on March 11, which destroyed the Tohoku region (Nord-East), for its reconstruction," M. Noda, who fears that this invasion of Yen can already kill the weak swelling in the cemetery.
The third economic world force, with the growth in the third quarter of the year, has once again gained tranquillity from the first quarter of this year, thanks to the explosive increases in exports and the consumption of the "plombed" households caused by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister appreciates that the invasion of Yen does not reflect the economic foundations of Japan.
On the other hand, the Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all presumably measures to dispose of Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, Vice-President of the Institute, noted that the BoJ had already launched "appropriate measures", which he reads to be confident that there is no additional currencies to be expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the Notenbank had increased its government bond purchases by 5.000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion) to sum up the 55.000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) amounts of cover which it had spent for various purchases of financial titles to overflow the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest feet faster to the height, stocks make backwards
The risk of the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European identification numbers.
Despite the office of the new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries are continually increasing.
The stocks that are still concerned about the stability of the euro area also operate this Tuesday, on November 15, a little more in negative fittings.
In Paris the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 o'clock and fell to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions relating to the profits of government loans in the euro area in difficulty, the global share markets continue to spend a part of their recent profits.
"The capital investors are nervous and are only well aware of the infringement risk," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters Press Agency.
Tokyo’s stocks, which, on the other hand, suffer from the refusal of market participants with regard to the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis continues, had closed with a pitch of 0.7%.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has focused its eyes on Europe, and trade is moving to a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ikiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurrection of the concern about the future of the euro area damages the unit currency that continues their baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for one and a half months.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, so it gave 0.4%.
According to the stockmakers, the CDU, the Chancellor Angela Merkel Party, who had gathered in the Convention on Monday, had submitted a request, which in particular provides for the possibility of expiring from the euro area by countries in difficulty, without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% limit.
Italy and Spain's loan rates remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of Italian bonds reached 6.85%, and those of the Spanish title grew to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed the fears of investors.
The future Italian Head of Government, Mario Monti, demanded more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by liability in Italy.
On the other hand, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken by the Eurozone Summit on 27 October was the main task of his government.
Spain is located in the Visir of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The "spread" between the German and Spanish 10-years lobbys has again reached a new historical high.
Expected growth in the euro area
In statistical terms, France recorded a 0.4% economic growth of household consumption in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Statistical Federal Office INSEE had revised the baisses of the figures of the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (BIP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worrys the economic experts most.
Germany, on the other hand, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first high-value of the entire euro area is expected at 11 a.m. and the EU Commission warns against the risk of re-recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should be victorious about dogs
If there is a topic that should not be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or by emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and costs of electricity directly affect the purchase power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to take a election meeting for the occasion, to reflect on this topic and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be fruit if it separates the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographical evolution will have to double the demand for electricity by the year 2050, but a huge proportion of the world's population should not have to quit a vital element.
At the same time, the shortcoming of fossil resources must be reduced in order to continue to produce continuous electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a topic lost from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remained isolated in its decision to quit nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is subject to his decision of the need to find a substituteable source, nor in Switzerland, which is just intended to build only nuclear power stations of the last generation.
However, the Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to call only some countries, continue to follow their projects with determination.
The United States, on the other hand, decided to join their park by re-operating the Three Mile Island work after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model aimed at renewable energy sources is occasionally set as an example, however, the reality contradicts the discourse.
Elections in Berlin will be defeated in the form of a degradation of the electricity price, an increased energy dependence on import gas, in particular Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal power plants.
The total of these unpleasant effects will be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
Denmark is, on the one hand, European table leader for wind energy, from which it refers to 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest uses of coal and gas, differently used with wind energy; therefore its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the continuity of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity account in contrast to our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy represents a key role in competitiveness and a national stability path of industry, the French companies have a advantage due to the most favourable electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a strong increase in the energy price, which will read the delicious statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of the purchase power to illusion.
Inquiries showed that it was a price that the large majority of the French are not ready to pay as much as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
As a matter of fact, the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build up an industry with 125,00 direct and 41,000 induced jobs.
Because of its strong export character, it brings a number of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises into the international markets and makes it a countless job creation.
If France took the decision to elapse from nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would be victims and the annual 6 billion euros of investment goods and nuclear exports would be more and more collapsed.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed for the operation of sixty years if the decline of its producer was pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, you must admit that there is just as little one as a devil’s work a miracle tool for the production of electricity.
The carbon-arm solutions developed by the company Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are proof of the complementarity of the energy sources.
To maintain the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for the nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority carrying out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as construction in Flamanville.
Their working teams who have made a name due to their professionalism are precisely possessed by the security idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious disorders.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has arrived under normal operating conditions, so he left without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Tschernobyl, the drama was reactor construction and infinite human failure.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been caused a mass that caused the death of several ten thousand people.
The core industry will draw its teachings from this accident as it did after the two previous.
As a fruit of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft that enables him to resist such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among the electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fantastic gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading them free train to travel the leadership position in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is indispensable and legitimate to search for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be unacceptable to make emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres dominate a debate determining the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many corners - overloading police, courts and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "Land of Human Rights", as France himself described.
Recently, the offensive against foreign students had shown the weekly views, which the Minister of Interior had announced (see Libération on 23 May) that France had not needed any talents, Maurer or Kellner from abroad.
But this policy was rarely analyzed from economic point of view.
In fact, there is a broad consensus between right and left.
On the right side, Jacques Chirac, who had explained in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, would not be a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990, France" could not take up the entire poverty of the world."
There is only a difference in the degree of high speed
The fear of the invasion of the national soil was divided from both right and left in 2005.
The immigrants were seen by both camps as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference exists in the degree of excess of immigrants to be admitted.
Francois Hollande is limited in his programme to bananas that indicate that partnership development allows it to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections, but it is economically expensive.
As our economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recently published work, which summarises the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive influence of immigration on economic growth, wages and jobs in immigration countries.
Restriction of immigration would reduce growth and harm the labour market situation.
The fears of the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening to replace local workers, especially the smaller qualified, by exercising pressure on their wages.
However, the experience shows that immigrants are in truth much more complementary than local wage workers, since they are exercising difficult jobs in sectors that are technically unusual.
The low-qualified immigrants work in sectors where local wage workers are little travelling, which are more qualified among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not comparable to the job offer.
Positive wage effect
Like a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesists, this complementarity also makes a positive effect between locals and migrants on wages and national labour market situations.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in immigration flow will result in a co-inclusive, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And these, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas and economic growth introduced by immigrants is at risk (their share of inhabited immigrants among American nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute net to social systems, in the European countries in the cutting up of about 1% of the overall budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person immigrant to Germany from 30 years of age brings a net contribution (income minus expenditure) to the public budget at an average over his lifetime from around EUR 150,000.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to make the missing cutpoints with the teeth when he arrived in his mandate.
These teeth, however, which should abstract immigrants, have achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy and now remains to reflect on European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good and also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had caused the tragedys of the First World War, Totalitarian, Holocaust, Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme of Greece.
Some have probably believed that it would be rich to exercise the right of vote, in a way that is directly possible, to see democracy overcome their enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little" that it was a characteristic of mindkeeping.
The general right of election, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this and can be as good as a 'depressive instrument' as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot then expressed.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of violence, training, education, economic and social Community spirit, a lawsuit.
The crisis in Europe in which we are in is an economic crisis, but it is as much and above all political and democratic crisis.
The change in mind of the Greek True-Falsch referendum would have had dual insight in this regard: once that of the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, their inappropriateness.
This ambition should be regarded as overcrowded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have moved today and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aimed at the right direction.
We have nothing to win to impose on a success of the national referendum, which was organized in dependence with the needs and in the wrong order.
A license for the European universal rulers or a jump with connected eyes into the empty of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizens!
No, we want hackebeil, but a collective task, with full right, clarified and steady, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - they do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is a whole Europe that is devoted to the dictate of the markets and credit rating agencies suffering from its powers and its lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
We are worried about the transfer of sovereignty towards Europe - it is all Europe that gradually loses its sovereignty, and so every one of the nations that belongs to it.
The urgency is to return the leadership of the European project to the people's sovereignty.
For the whole is the fact that Europeans are able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets, and a future through investments.
The rise from the crisis has decisions at European level to a condition which cannot be taken without total democratic legality without certainly leading us into destruction.
After this proposal has been debated by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, everyone is pressing on European economic governance today.
Congratulations.
However, without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it foretells the citizens - would be a new foolishness and another sackgasse.
We need to take a new stage of European construction.
In order to create the Republic in France, the fact needed to "create the Republicans".
The revolution of the interests alone could not be sufficient here.
This training remains valid.
We must form a better integrated Europe at economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become to the general benefit
The World Messe for Chip Cards opens their gates in a optimistic position in Villepinte near Paris on Tuesday.
According to Eurosmart, the year 2011 should end with an increase of 11% in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most viable segment is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the map on a reader.
Over the 320 million previously sold this year, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide!
Their market share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins with regard to the inconsistent payment of ground after a long period of decline in the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets make steam.
Carrefour has therefore emitted 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary that the banks provide their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed themselves to providing their customers systematically banking cards that have been recorded with contactless chips in the future," announced Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Test banks Payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the payment means of the future: the mobile phone.
A diminishing low percentage of devices has been equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication).
"They're in delay."
"But they should experience real upward development at least next year."
"We expect the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to the next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are intended to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also the Société Générale had said yesterday to prepare the introduction of a market offer that allows their customers to pay without contact by phone.
Terrorist front understands, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is worried about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram Secta.
The long-lasting relationships between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian secta Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday the Algerian Vice-Auβen Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algier has now gained certainty about it.
"The way both organisations are dealing with and the relationships of the secret services indicate a clear cooperation," he explained without further details.
Paris seems to do a similar analysis.
The investigations on the kidnapping of two French people in Niger took place in January have promoted interfaces for days.
The Antoine de Léócour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by adherents of the Aqmi, were to have been killed at the same time the following days as several of their kidnappers at the time of a operation carried out by the French special units.
French and Nigerian mediators want to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists in the drums at the place of operation.
Terrorist Axes
The analysis of conducted phone calls leads to several conversation partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the mediators are particularly interested in the numbers of two partners: one number leads to a Nigerian who has long been in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, which had stopped the wall of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered close as the Aqmi and the secta.
"This is a progress, but you must certainly wait for more clear evidence before you can talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's possible, however."
"You have been aware of the financial and intellectual support of Auβen for years and that it is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo relieves.
In these last months, these "support services" have become increasingly visible in their course, as well as the talks as the operation modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the withdrawal of suicide attackers and the use of ever more complex explosives that wear the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
Since that time, the International Community has exercised pressure on Abuja in order to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the grouping as a Community of Illuminates, which should not be given special attention.
Fast Success
Boko Haram, founded in 2002 in Maiduguri near a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means as much as "the Western education is a shame" - pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the north of Nigeria.
In this medium-sized region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
She is politics and demands strict compliance with the sharia, while its shared activists engage in the fight against the wicked central government.
The activists first have churches, bars and authorities in the vision.
In 2009 Boko Haram's activists were particularly active with their increased attacks against the Commissioners.
However, Abuja’s reaction is as usual indifferent.
The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, captured in prison, is killed in prison.
As a result, the cult becomes more radical and leaves its highburgs in the north.
Last Christmas she acknowledged her assault in Jos, which demanded 80 human lives, then to another one in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the blame of a suicide attack that took place in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - the first of his kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations is the first international target disc.
The creation of a terrorist axle in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania over Nigeria to Somalia, has been worrying since then all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have been occupied to operate the Somalians of al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé warned with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria about Boko Harem and was ready to be able to communicate all the instructions."
The world of the Republican Presidential Candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rivalise in simplifying and ignorance of China, Iraq and the aid for Israel.
Can a crises weakened America lead a complex world with simple ones not to say: embarrassing ideas?
If you listen to the Republican Presidency candidates like this, the voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their competitors have repeatedly made their donor declarations and their statements on Auβen policy, traditional republikanic focus.
About China, Iran and Israel's help fall - often in no way undermined - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" the highest in the course of the "Romney", the Chinese were threatening to quote before the WTO and to address the leading topic of "Worlding Manipulation" in America, which is the most intrigued by the migrating of all industrial branches to Asia.
He was stupid if this was to implicate the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of Auβen politics, has almost cut off the air as regards his emotions of smiling gestures.
He had called for a hand-fast but constructive exchange of conversations with Beijing (also the current Obama's).
But Huntsman isn't answered because he stagnates in the depths of the opinion surveys.
Reagan's Ebenbild
Romney had also praised military battles against Iran if the sanctions to stop the nuclear programme were to fail.
"If I'm elected, I'm ordering to stop Iran," he'd beaned.
"If Obama is chosen again, they'll get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama to remain guilty to this partner of commitments.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-two-third candidate, has a shameful independence of acts on his part.
Recently he called on the Chinese military threat to contra, as Beijing attempts to develop a nuclear power" - and thereby seemed to be the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military battles against Iran, is on his part willing to serve the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The rejection of torture against mutmaβ terrorists forbidden by Obama 2009 was also supported by Cain, Perry and the candidation Michele Bachmann.
One is far away from John McCain, the republikan candidate in 2008, an out-political heavy weight.
The current presidential counterparts, Reagan also had simple ideas and, despite all, won the Cold War.
They remind you that Obama was also an amateur and had to give water into his wine, which was the subject of antiterrorism.
They rightly persist in the failure of his naive interdependence with Iran, the presumptuous withdrawal of his " boys" from Iraq, his undecisiveness in Libya, which also brought him the reputation of weakness.
However, this enemy is not quite unforced.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has been guarding against military interventions that lead to awkwards.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by reasoning that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to raise its leadership position to new life.
Nord Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the Baltic Sea ground and connects Western Europe directly to Russia, has been operated.
It is intended to supply gas for a equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to do this event with glory and Gloria.
More than 500 charged guests, including four Heads of State and Government, have lived on the eastern coast last Tuesday with orchestra salary and with fine taste buffet the introduction of the new gas transmission Nord Stream, which is directly connected to Russia and Germany under sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have, symbolically, jointly turned the tax of the valve, which transports the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas discharge, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gases per year will be delivered to West Europe by the first 1.224 km of pipeline, which connects the Sankt Petersburg region with Mecklenburg prepommers.
A second pipeline that allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the total French consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And it is already allowed to climb the eventuality of the construction of a third guide to the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this huge construction works like a victory.
The project was strongly contested in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord-Stream pipeline will allow direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any crossing by third countries (Polen or Ukraine) on the landways.
That is why these two countries lose a little of their power: it will now be more difficult for them to exercise pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, the strongest engaged in the debate, was not backwards to compare the Nord-Stream pipeline with a "new German-sowiet Pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the topic is politically too sensitive.
West Europe has gained even greater security of supply by supporting this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of the deployment of European energy, as the project has broken a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has completed its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, which have strong gas consumption and disgust their gases.
"This gas discharge is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new species that connects us organically," François Fillon confirmed in the introduction of the gas discharge by pointing out in what degree the large gas contracts are also important from political and economic sides.
All of this explains the wide smile of the many Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin as regards the gas pipeline.
The construction of this gas discharge is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater line consists of steel with beto-name deposition to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the sea ground, in about 200 m depth.
In their construction, mine fields dating from World War II had to be eliminated.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be cautiously removed or destroyed," Jens Müller, speaker of the Nord Stream Society, stated.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect Fauna and Flora.
The direction is a long snake of metal, hard like 242 oak towers that have been interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither through valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned at the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have taken away from it, since Sweden had little desire to see a Russian state company sit permanently at its coastal level.
"In the case of a havarie, we close the gas flow in less than one minute," Jens Müller explained.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline thus deviates into the air.
However, this case is regarded as little likely by the designers, as the sweat neares were estimated to be a resistant of a leak per 100,000 years.
State surveillance of the gas transmission will be ensured by a subwater robot that is controlled for external observation purposes from a sea vessel, as well as by an apparatus that circulates inside the gas discharge.
It has the form of a cigar, a meter diameter, is introduced into the inside of the pipeline and continues through the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the direction at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device will provide the exact information about any deformations of the metal at its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to be undertaken only the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is simply guaranteed by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access-, 100 bar at the exit site.
Five companies have united their powers to achieve this project.
However, the leadership remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E. ON and BASF are also grouped here (by 15,5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunion and the French GDF Suez Group (only 9%).
These five companies have created a company community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
She has her seat in train in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then borrowed the entire capacity of its gas transport, to the extension of the twenty-year Treaty.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transporter gas amounts," explained Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured at 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For example, the investment sum for GDF Suez amounted to 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are weighed to retrieve their discharges, since Gazprom alone has the risk of liability.
The gas pipes appear at a sandy, with bowls forested coastline at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas outlets.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other identification numbers of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since the last Tuesday this terminal has been delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gases per hour.
With full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Moleskine now wishes to reconvene the writing by an Italian company about fifteen years ago.
It has a flair of adventures, spent hours with the writing on candles.
The memobook of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with its black, rectangular band, its rubber band, the ovary-coloured sides, as over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as it is known today, has been created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, who has its seat in Milan, decided to bring a separate design notebook to the market.
Maria Sebregondi, then specialist consultant of the company, is responsible for the introduction of the new product on the market.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshut), which is called a cotton latch, for example used for covering polster benches.
This type of notebook was very demanded among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has resurrected an old and almost forgotten object, which until the 20th century was considered an icon of avantgardist artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now trader responsible for Modo Modo.
Success occurs.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increase by 26% and increase with a paragraph of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a fantatom picture of the buyers, as the notebook is also enthusiastic to businesses as well as students and experts.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open spirit customers.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees at its beginnings, has now over 100 employees and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in books, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and understands that they are using their identity.
"We have followed the time spirit and his new need to write, which exists despite the e-mail swung," said Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: The brand recently launched an exposure called "Detour (Umweg)" in which architects and artists issued their own notebooks.
In August, at the Locarno Film Festival, the company also brought a band of leopard patterns on the market.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit and understood to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fillers, computers... The brand shows the entire bandwidth of articles.
A success that brings jealousy to the plan: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened up a new chapter in the history of Moleskine Company.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of the disabled are looking for a job.
Today the "15th week of work for disabled people" begins.
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in disabled persons is always twice as high as the average average: 19% against 9% of total unemployment.
Dismaying?
"No, so emphasizes Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association Adapt, who sets out the week of work for disabled persons."
"The progress achieved within fifteen years is significant."
"Then the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."
"Nothing of it remains huge to do."
However, it has to be said that many obstacles remain before they get a job for disabled people.
More frequently, the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no abitural and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also widespread: 53% in disabled people compared to 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that make a new increase in work difficult and which are the "creator of the problem", says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a 1992 founded association that helps companies to apply disabled workers.
So much to the real brakes.
Keeps the unpredicted, the minds, which certainly develop slowly, though.
A study conducted in April by the IMS entrepreneurs for the magazine La Cité stated that the consulted managers have "a weak level of knowledge about disabled persons", which "overrepresented" is "by people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual minority".
The result is that the private companies with more than 20 employees still have a broad way to achieve the employment goal of 6% disabled persons, which was laid down in a law of 1987.
These last-name figures from 2008 refer to a quota of 2.6%.
"We are now at about 3%," reports Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organisation which is responsible for incurring contributions from companies who disregard this law.
The evidence: The number of "payers" establishments has decreased as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act, which provides for increases in contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, explained Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses real knowledge, especially in the large business groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the establishments employ disabled persons between 20 and 49 employees, while companies with 100 to 199 employees are 82%.
Hazard: "What a luck"
Already before they offered the "Blue Servants" (20:45 o'clock), Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had not celebrated their pleasures that brought them the friendship game.
It would be too far taken to claim that there has been a secret consent between them, but the picture speaks symbolic bands.
Siting side on side on the audience podium of the City of France George Leekens and Eden Hazard could well and would like to conclude peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had harvested nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," assures the infant Liller on his side.
As for the contrast between his presentation in club and national self"It is a unit that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year long over what is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday evening against Romania as regards the match against France to finally "brighten".
However, without leaving the note of the "goodness".
The French national team has been hired since the age of 7 years, he led his victorious fields between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This necessarily contributes to strengthening the "one-like" character of this meeting.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just walked over the way."
"With having them to play means great luck!"
Leekens read on his side with kindness "Stolz".
"The pride to bear a galamatch."
"Stolz" also to confirm - in his property as "afterchildren" - that France has again become a very high level team" and that little more than a year after the dream of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done great work," he enthusiasticly said.
Although Belgium will lack in the next European championship, the technician is very sure to see the plane shared with the Blues (France National Elf) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out greatly," he stressed.
"We are planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You will notice that in the coming games." The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento met with great optimism against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
At the end of the year, both teams had missed the fairness.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is not the lowest approach of doubt that "La Selecçao", his national self, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will be qualified for the European Championship in 2012.
In fact, for Portugal, this means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play and serve a opponent, Bosnia.
In view of the adversity (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it appears that the cubes have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the party for more than an hour, but the team was unable to press the matter on the so important stamp that would have taken the pressure from her.
"This is a good result, but it is a certain risk, since we haven't achieved an outward gate."
At home, however, in its brightly illuminating city of de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to be in the face of an audience, which would also be hot on the game, even if the party was announced of course as "very scarce", the optimistic but clear Bento said.
"We expect a very narrow match, but we are perfectly convinced that we can win the top hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have a 50% chance to be at the European Championship in 2012," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz relatived.
The disagreement on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to reach and win a gate.
A disagreement can already satisfy the Bosnians who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, but it is a certain risk, since we haven't achieved an outward gate," regrets Bento.
"We will come against a team of high technical qualities and have players with many individual qualities," he added.
As already in Zenica, the Portuguese would like to exercise maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning to "not give them time to think."
A good idea, subject to the fact that it is implemented this time.
