High governmenters are concerned about ‘looking like a flon’
In some Members of the Welsh Parliament, a member of the Committee of the Welsh, there is a proposal to allow them to change their title to MWP.
The concerns arise because of the plan to change the name of the Council in the Committee of Welfare.
In all classes, authorities are worried that they may be distressed.
One employee officer said that his group was worried that “their twp and Pwp are rimming. ”
For readers who live outside Wales: in goodness, twp means stupid and pwp means fool.
A member of Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole was “unpleasant” and had made other suggestions to the name.
The Consultant of the Good Conservation Group said that his group had a “open mind” on the change of the name, but pointed out that there was no great difference between the words MWP and Muppet (fluent).
In this context, it can be noted that the well-being character w is presented in the same way as in Icelandic.
The counsel, which is now working on a legal TV to present the name change, said: “The final decision on all the names that are headed over the members of the Council will, of course, be lying to the members themselves. ”
The Law on the Government of Wales (The Government of Wales Act 2017) gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council published the findings of public opinion surveys that showed great support for calling the Board of Welfare.
The WMP (Welsh Parliament members, senior senators) chose for the title of the supervisors, but MWP was most supported by the public in the surveys.
According to news, counselors now make other suggestions, but it might be difficult to reach a meeting for the President of the Council, Elin Jones, who should present a draft for the changes within a few weeks.
The initial television on improvements will also include other changes in the functioning of the Council, including rules on the exclusion of Governors and the organisation of the Committee.
In the beginning of discussions on the radio, the authorities will be able to make final statements on their title.
Macedonians vote in the elections on a change in the country’s name
The votes will be paid on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country into the “North Macedonia State.”
This matter was undertaken in an attempt to solve a decades - long conflict with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own region named Macedonia.
Athena City has long argued that the name of their neighbours in the north equivalent requirements in its territory and has often objected to their application for membership of the EU and Nato.
President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the change of name, has said that he will not consider the elections valid.
However, supporters of the votes, including President Zoran Zaev, have said that the change of name is simply the price that needs to be paid for membership of the EU and Nato.
Church Clock St. Martin's sound is a church in Harlem in difficulty
“ The older people I’ve been talking to said that earlier, a bar and a church were found in every corner of the street, ” said Mr. Adams.
“Today there is no one to find there.”
He said that it would be understandable that bars would slow down.
"The people have other ways to meet" today, he said.
"Bars are no longer the centres of the area where people regularly meet."
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money earned from sales will not last as long as leaders are expecting “and sooner or later they will be back to the original place. ”
He added that possible churches were replaced by a living house full of people who would not help to save the surroundings.
“ The largest majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, ” he said, “and will therefore hurry away from the permanent closure of these churches, because it is unlikely that most people who live in these apartments become members of these churches. ”
Both churches were based on white congregations before Harlem became the center of the Black Metropolitan Community church in 1870, and St. Martin’s church decades later.
The early white methist congregation moved out in the 1930 ’ s.
The congregation of blacks who had served in the neighborhood took over the building.
The congregation of blacks took over St. Martin’s church under the leader John Howards Johnson, who had the initiative to avoid traders at the 125th Street, Harlem’s main shop gate, who desired to advise or give them an increase in the position.
The building was seriously damaged in 1939, but members of their own Johnson congregation planned to rebuild it and also let them build the clock game.
Especially David Johnson, a son and a successor of his son Johnson, proudly called the clock game “the bell of the poor people. ”
The expert who played the clock game in July called it a different name: “Culture Funds ” and“ a unique historical instrument. ”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also claimed that this was the first clock game in the world that a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, played on, but he moved over to a bigger clock game in Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin hadn't got anyone else in his place.
In recent months, many architects and architects have taken their way to St. Martin, some of the leaders of the church, and others of the bishop.
The church council - supervising the attendance and appointed church leaders - wrote the bishop in July and expressed its concern that the bishop “will seek to overcome the costs of the church council, even though it had not been involved in the architects and tasks sent by the bishop.
Some attendants complained about the lack of transparency of biscuits.
Hayer hurts 13 - year - old boy who screwed by a humor in California
According to the authorities, a 13 - year - old hay was attacked and injured on Saturday when the boy was dying after a humor in California on the first day of the humor fishing period.
The attack was just before seven o’clock in the morning near the Beacon’s Beach coast of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been busy with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then run over with the group of others to help get him up from the water.
Hammel said that he had initially thought that it was just excited to have a humor, but then “he realized that the boy cried out,“ I was biten!
I was biten!"
All his bone was revoked," said Hammel about what he saw when he came to the boy.
“ I cried to everyone to come up from the water, “There is a shark in the water!” added Hammel.
The boy was transferred with a helicopter to the Rady Kids Hospital in San Diego, where he lie seriously hurt.
The type of shark that attacked the boy is not known.
The shore guard, Larry Giles, said at a media meeting that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but he was not of a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious damage to the upper body.
The authorities closed the beach from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, in a research and security sense.
Giles said that more than 135 different types of sharks are in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plan to shake the world on the UK dressing market
Sainsbury’s intends to eat a rival with Boots, Superdrugs, and Debenhams with dressing fittings in a commercial center style and with specially trained helpers.
This is part of the plan to enter the UK-marketed goods, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds, and is increasingly growing while sales of fashion and home goods decreases.
Investment in cleaning goods is part of a large-scale market for the use of a refrigerator used in the past of visions, microwave ovens, and home goods.
Sainsbury’s says that it is expected to double up to 3,000 types of goods, including a trademark like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive increased space with marked areas similar to those found in the shop like Boots.
The business is also going to restart the sale of its Boutique cargo selection so that the majority of the goods are road-free, but younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop will test the commodities in the two Sainsbury’s store, the first opened in Croydon in South London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
The web shop and the increased tendency of consumers to buy a small amount of food every day in the environment means that large markets need to work more to get people to come to their homes.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury’s executive, said that the shops would be more and more like commercial centers as the commercial chain attempts to fight the Aldi and Lidl low warehouses with more service and lips than food.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos camps in hundreds of shops and has also presented a number of Habitat camps in history since both chains were bought two years ago.
The first attempt of the shop to resurrect its cleaning and pharmaceutical departments was not successful.
Sainsbury’s tried to cooperate with Boots around the year 2000, resulting in differences in how to share the sales of medicinal products in the large limits.
The new path comes after Sainsbury’s sale of his 281 product stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd’s pharmaceuticals, on 125 million pounds three years ago.
According to the approach, Lloyds will play a role in these programmes by adding a large selection of luxury preservatives, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, manager of Sainsbury’s market, said: “We have transformed the appearance of our dressing wheels to improve the environment for our clients.
In addition, we have invested in special training for staff that will be within our hands for advice.
Our carriage selection is designed to meet all the needs. A charming environment and comfortable locations make us an exciting cosy store that transforms old commercial habits."
Peter Jones “awful” after Holly Willoughby ceases with 11 million pounds of contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, became “awful” after the television sensus Holly Willoughby ceased at 11 million pounds of contract with his company to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home and component brands, Truly.
The company had been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, 37 years old, presented in The Morning, announced his decision at Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the stars of Dragons ’ Den, with pain still by ceasing to participate in a popular lifestyle company at the last hour to focus on new and pleasant agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to Jones, when the television woman popularly acknowledged she had not enough time for the home and component brand Truly because of the new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds.
The company has been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow lips, and was intended to double the property of Willoughby, which is estimated to be 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, aged 37, announced in Instagram that she was going to get out of Truly, Jones fled from Britain to stay in one of her many summer homes.
A source reported: “Truly was longest on Holly’s priority.
This would be her future task, which would result in her taking over the next two decades.
Her decision to stop all of them came into an open shield.
No one could believe what happened on Thursday, it was so short that the line went to the market.
It's full of lips at Marlow's headquarters that's ready to sell."
Experts believe that the elimination of This Morning, including British most popular stars, can cost the company millions because of high commodities, from puddings and candles to clothing and home goods, and may cause further delays in selling the goods.
In addition, this could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been a friend of Jones and Tura Capp, his wife, for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52 years old, joined them as Head of Directors in March.
The couple spend their summer vacations together with Jones on a 40 - percent share in Baldwin, which produces television.
Willoughby will be the official representative of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the ITV member I'm a Celebrity.
Last night, a founder close to Jones said: “We don’t want to say anything about his business. ”
Difficult discussions “and then we became in love”
He assumed the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate to Presidents, and for being so positive to the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump left so much?
Said Trump and followed the newsman's voice.
“I haven’t left anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards nuclear weapons North Korea.
On the other hand, discussions about defeating nuclear weapons have stopped.
More than three months after the June Ivory in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, the chief ambassador of North Korea, said to the international leader at the STH General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not been “appropriate” from the United States at the first steps of North Korea to the direction of nuclear weapons.
Rather, he said that the United States continued business prayers in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was more positive in his meeting.
"We greatly compare with North Korea," he said.
“ We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
Now our relationship is great."
He explained his attempts to improve Kim’s relationship have returned positive results - tests of firefighting had stopped, hostages had been released, and the earthly remnant of American soldiers was returned home.
In addition, he was unusual about his relationship with Kim.
“ It is so easy to act as a president, but instead of having 10 000 people outside trying to enter a tricky scene, only 200 people standing there, ” said Trump, pointing to the crowd in front of themselves.
Flood waves and earthquake in Indonesia causes major damage on the island, hundreds have died
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, international rescue organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s inhabitants had to flee their homes, emergency situations were not declared, but this is why international organizations can have help there.
“In many cases, they have unfortunately stated that they are not going to ask for assistance from international organisations, so that this is difficult,” said Miss Sumbung.
Although the Save the Children organization is putting together teams to travel to Palu, it is still not possible when foreign auxiliary workers can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman of the country’s disaster agency, said that Indian ministers were appreciating the situation in Pala to see if international organizations should be allowed to assist in the aid work.
Based on how common earthquakes are in Indonesia, the land is sadly unprepared to defend natural powers.
The river waves have been built in Aceh, which is rarely seen at other coastal lines.
Apparently, even if a warning was issued, a defense of Palu’s flood waves has still increased.
Even under the best circumstances, it may be a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make planning even more complex.
A nurse ship that has been at the port of Lombok for the victims of the earthquake is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to get to the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made it essential for his campaign to rebuild degraded transport routes, and he has put a lot of money into the roads and railroads.
However, a shortage of finance has plaaged Mr. Joko’s government, but the next year’s elections will be held.
Mr. Joko also needs to face persistent tension between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the majority of Muslims have acquired a more conservative religion.
Over 1,000 people died, and tens of thousands of people had to leave their homes that were in the way of Christian and Muslims struggling on the streets with swords, bows, and arrows, and other basic weapons.

He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to shoot toward the distance.
The ball flew high over the target and towards its right corner.
The ball finally went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and to the net.
"I just wanted to try to get into this position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq playing it always as long as possible so I tried to create as much time as I could," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
“ I saw Kante come and touch once, and I didn’t think so much about it, but I just took the shot.”
Chelsea was over 1-0 in half, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard cut out in 25 minutes.
In the visit, the Chelsea attendee gave the ball with a tail to Mateo Kovacic and then spread from the center to the play half of Liverpool.

Cromwell's shortest British session is the latest memorandum that is accused of ‘rewriting history’
The ban would be poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of his superstitious puritan followers on so many cultural and religious devils of England.
On the other hand, the Cromwell Society said that Mr. Crick's suggestion was "fabulous" and "a attempt to rewrite the story."
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the discussion of removing a map, it was unavoidable that the formation of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Hall would be before the battle.
The death of the English Civil War against the cultural signs was neither order nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for his ancestor Thomas’s actions in the preceding century.
The glorious form of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is at the end of the 19th century and is part of a man’s history that many people believe that they still deserve.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is counted by many, perhaps rather late in the 19th century, rather than today, who have been the protector of the Assembly against external pressure, in his case of the kingdom.
There is still a great historical question whether this description is entirely correct.
However, the conflict that was in the middle of the 17th century may have shaped our nation’s development and that Cromwell is a well - known person who represents one side of their conflict.
It is worth pleasing and remembering his accomplishment as a protector of the kingdom."
Swine attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him
The pig attacked a Chinese farmer, killing him on the market in the southwest part of China, according to news from the place.
The man, named only by his surname “Yuan”, was found dead with a broken artery and thick blood near the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou, according to reports from South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farm prepares to inject the vaccine in pigs in pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai, China.
According to him, he had traveled with his cousin from Yunnan neighborhood to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the nearby swine stood open.
He said that the inside of the style had been a big gaze with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, a trial confirmed that 250 kg of the jewelry had killed the farmer.
"My uncle's feet were bloody and injured," said the uncle, with the surname "Wu", to the Guiyang Evening News news room.
The recording from a safety camera showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his uncle.
The owner of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked inside so that it did not attack anyone else while the police collected evidence in the field.
According to news, the Yuan family and the owners of the market have to discuss improvements for his death.
There are recorded examples that pigs attacked people, although rare.
In 2016, pigs attacked a woman and her husband on their house in Massachusetts and seriously hurt the man.
Ten years earlier, a grain of 300 pounds of pigs at a dragon machine climbed until his wife fell away from the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon had been eaten by his pigs in 2012, a other farmer from Manitoba at CBC News said that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that a blood taste can awaken their aggression.
“ They're just playing.
They'd like to get a glimpse, and they're curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them belonging respect," he said.
The remnant of the Orthodox Rosa brings great results over the southwest of the United States
As foretold, the strength of the turbulent Rosa decreases when it crosses the cooler seas at the northern coast of Mexico.
On the other hand, Rosa will bring a great result that could cause floods in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa became an orbital in class 1, with a wind strength of 136 km per hour, at 5: 00 a.m. to the eastern coast of Sunday, and he was located over 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is estimated to go northeast on Sunday.
At the same time, it is low in the formation of the Pacific and will go eastwards to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives at the Baja California disaster on Monday as a tropical storm, it will therefore follow a great tropical tray northwards into the southwest of the United States.
Rose will follow up to 25 cm of outcome in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical ray will be mixed with the nearer layers, which will form a large and wide-ranging result over the southwest part of the next days.
Local outcomes of 2.5 to 10 cm may cause dangerous seizures, soil movement, and possible stages in the wilderness.
A large tropical tractor will cause up to 5 to 10 cm loss in an hour in some places, especially in the southern part of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of outcome is expected in some areas of the southwest part, especially in the majority of Arizona.
There is a potential for sudden floods with rapidly deteriorating circumstances due to the distribution of tropical rains.
People are strongly advised to avoid walking into the wilderness when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can change the gills into the blowing river, and thunderstorms may result in steam - storms.
The nearby curtain will carry a local outcast in certain areas at the southern California coastline.
There is a potential of more than 1 cm of decay that may cause a small movement of the ground and a throat on the road.
This is the first result of the area during the rain period.
Some dispersed tropical clouds will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the outbreak spreads over larger areas late on Monday and Tuesday.
A great result will spread out over four branches on Tuesday, and will end on Wednesday.
It is expected that there will be great temperature change throughout the United States in October, as the North Coastal Territories are chilling, but the tropical vent is preferred to continue a little sound.
Sometimes this can cause high temperatures over short distances.
In the middle of the United States, there was a very good example of great heat variations on Sunday.
There is almost 7 degrees of temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summers will try to build up and distribute again.
It is expected that a large part of the Middle and Eastern United States will begin on October with a temperature of about 25 degrees or more from the southern plains to the northeast.
Heat could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Thursday, about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long - term weather prophecy indicates that there is a high risk of temperature above the average for the eastern part of the United States in the former October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings
Over 20 million people looked at the exciting witness Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Judge, on the Thursday and the Witness of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse that should have occurred in the 1990 ’ s, which was sent to six different channels.
At the same time, the political position continued, and television stations interrupted a regular schedule to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, an Algerian Senior Division, presented a radio that the FBI could investigate the accusations for one week.
Ford told the elders’s judicial committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk her and tried to dress her out at a school party.
In a emotional witness, Kavanaugh said that he was confident that it had not happened.
It is likely that more people have been watching the court proceedings than the 20,4 million noted by Nielsen that they were watching on Friday.
The company measured the average view of the TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not available immediately for other television channels showing the interrogations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Likewise, Nielsen usually faces problems with measuring the views of people in offices.
To put this into a context, this audience group is similar to the size of the football or the Oskar Prize Festival.
According to Nielsen, most of the interviews that took the whole day were on Fox News Channel or 5.69 million.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million audiences.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC was 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million and CNN was 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, there was a lot of interest.
Flake was the center of the hallon on Friday.
After the office of this Congregator of the Repubications Group, he announced that he would choose Kavanaugh in favour, CNN and CBS received the pictures of the protesters making a call to him on Friday morning, when he tried to go into the lift to reach a meeting at the Judgment Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while soon rained over him in a direct broadcast at the CNN.
One woman said: “I stand right in front of you. ”
“ Do you think he is telling the truth to the nations? ”
People said to him: “You have authority while so many women are unrighteous. ”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and before he closed the lift door, he said he would speak rather at the committee meeting.
The Kapal and Television Stations were all sent directly later when the Judgment Committee chose whether to send the name Kavanaugh for elections at the Elderly Department.
Flake said he would only do it if the FBI investigated the accusations against the appointed one next week, but the minority of the Democrats has encouraged it.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend Chris Coons, the Deputy Senator of Democrats.
Flake made his decision after conversation with Coons and some other elders.
Flake’s comments were significant, as it was clear that the reputations did not have enough votes to accept Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has allowed the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
May, British Prime Minister, is accused of critics of being “in political acts” because of Brexit
In a interview at The Sunday Times, Theresa May, President-in-Office of the Council, accused the critics of her plan to leave the European Union of ‘being in politics’ on the future of the United Kingdom and burying the interests of the country.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, will be attended by the Conservative Group in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In a second interview, which was published next to her interview on the front page of the magazine, Boris Johnson, former foreign minister, acknowledged that the so-called Chequers programme on Brexit, which said that the fact that the United Kingdom and the European Union should be deprived of each other, was “incredibly deprived. ”

Police have arrested one suspect due to the death of Wayde Sims in a fatal shooting attack, a 20 - year - old basketball player at the LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for the murder of another degree, according to the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities revealed a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, saying that Sims had lost their glasses in the battles.
Police found the glasses in the field and said that they found Simpson’s genotypes, according to WAFB, CBS’s sister company.
The police say Simpson has confessed to hearing that Wayde was shot and killed.
According to his lawyer, a sum of $350,000 was a certain assurance.
The office of the courts of the East Baton Rouge County published an emergency report on Friday, which says that the cause of death is a gun shot in the head and down to the neck.
The authorities would like to thank a police team in Louisiana, the police police investigator, the police at Southern University and the local citizens for the help of the study that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, chairman of LSU’s sports, thanked the law enforcement officers for “his zeal and seeking righteousness. ”
Sims was 20 years old.
In Baton Rouge, his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points at the average and took 2.6 absorptions for each game during the last playtime.
Will Wade, basketball coach LSU, said on Friday morning that the team was "beaten" and "in shock" due to the death of Wayde.
“This is something you’re worried about in every time,” said Wade.
The Firebjerg runs an ashes over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl Mountain has reached the southern capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention (The National Center for Disaster Prevention) advised Mexico’s people to stay away from the Mount after the activity in the gig and recorded 183 cases of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center was watched by tightening and screwings from the mountain.
Pictures of social media showed a thin layer of ashes on cars in Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Architects have noted an increased activity in the mountain, 72 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital, since earthquake was 7.1 on Richter, over the middle of Mexico in September 2017.
The fire mountain, known as “Don Goyo, ” has been active since 1994.
Police in conflict with Catalonian separators just before the birthday of the Independence Rate
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independent Protestants took an impartial police and thousands participated in protests on the occasion of the first birthday of the controversial elections in Catalonia to describe independence.
A group of masked separates stoned an inherited police with eggs, throwing dust painting that formed a dark dust cloud on the street, usually full of travelers.
Conflicts also broke out a day later, and the police used cracks to hold conflicts.
Groups of separators cried: “We don’t forget and don’t forgive ” for a few hours while their opponents shouted against, “Lone will live Spain. ”
Fourteen had to be reconciled because of the minor hurt they had experienced during the protests, according to the local media.
One year after 1 October, the National Assembly was sentenced illegally by the authorities in Madrid, but was celebrated by the Catalonian separation.
Most of the choosers chose independence, but the participants were poor because most of those who were opposed to separation ignored the elections.
According to the Catalonian authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed in the past when police tried to stop the elections of the elections throughout the region, which led to a conflict.
Groups of independents had stayed out of the night on Friday to prevent protests to support the country’s police.
But the protest was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, 68 - year - old electrician, participated in the arguments of a separator with his wife, saying that he was no longer hoped that Catalonia would gain independence.
“ In the past, we experienced some of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry out of joy over having a choice, but now we're sitting fast," he said.
In spite of the need for a short victory in the field surveys last December, Catalonia’s independent groups have had difficulty to keep steam this year, since many of the most famous leaders are either in voluntary exile or in a waiting for trials because of their role in the organisation of the Action Planning and the Independence Statement.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old engineer who protested to support the police on his phone, said that politicians of both officers had encouraged the dispute.
"The pen grows increasingly," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders who have been in prison and have been waiting for courts from the last year, announced that he would offer himself to the European Parliament next year.
“My opinion on the European councils is the best way to condemn the return in the field of democratic values and the oppression we have seen the Spanish government use,” he said.

Menga scores in 1-0 victory of Livingston against Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga guaranteed the victory of Livingston
L. Livingston, who came from the lower department, came in a open shield, and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as executive director of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga did the luck and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
The Lit Gerrard has not yet worked on the exercising industry in this playtime and plays against Heart’s eight stages in front of the top seat, the next Sunday.
For that game, Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna in the European Department on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still victorious with six victories, and the main coach Holt has not yet had to experience loss since he substituted Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities against biteless guests
Holt’s team should have been over long before it made a point, but their bone cutting caused Ranger’s great trouble.
Scott Robinson reached a break, but he hiked in his attempt to explore, and Alan Lithgow then pushed over after he had run through the defense to receive a scalp from Graig Halkett opposite to the target.
The guests made Rangers play in the front of them calmly, knowing that they could cause guests trouble in the right places.
And it was so that the goal was made important.
Rangers received an additional question, and Livingston worked to create a target tool. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga together, who received a shipment and scored from the centers of the Vitateig.
On that stage, Rangers had ruled over the ball, but the defense of the locals was inevitable, and Liam Kelly, a target guard, did not have to do much.
Thus, this continued in the second half game, although Alfredo Morelos had come to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor, the targetman of Rangers, and Lithgow shot from a target after a visit from Livingston.
The questions were constantly in the Vitategey of Livingston, but were expelled from, and two demands for the confusion - according to Halkett's defence against Glenn Middleton, and one after hand - were rejected.
"Great" in Livingston Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, reporter BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Beautiful appearance and outcome for Livingston.
For a normal man, they stood great and continued to go out of all their expectations.
Their playstyle and their officers have hardly changed anything since they returned to the upper division, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for having hoped together from their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the palace was very good and led the full - ordered defence, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toes all the time.
On the other hand, Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s control, they played far under expectations.
They failed to complete their visits and only once managed to open the valley half of their homes so this should be awake for Rangers who are now sitting in the middle of the department.
Erdogan receives hidden receptions in Cologne
It was smiled and lightened on Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s visit to Germany, which has the purpose of improving relations between the two nations.
There have been disagreements between them because of issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkish entry into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open up a new giant mosque.
The city is the home of most Turkish residents outside Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosquito, but many supporters were able to see their president nearby.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan, many of them of Kurds, also heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German governments to offer him to the land.
The two Protestant groups reflect the controversy of this guest, who is cherished by some of the Turks in Germany, and hatred as a dictator of others.

Rosa’s Fellibyl threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (a dry area could benefit from)
It is uncommon that the tropical layer is over Arizona, but it is likely that it will be early next week when the remnant of the orbulent Rosa passes over the southwest part, at the risk of seizures.
The weather room of the country has already issued warnings due to sudden floods before Monday and Thursday in the western parts of Arizona and the south and west of Nevada, the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is estimated to cross Phoenix directly on a Thursday and come late on Monday with a result.
The Phoenix weather room said on Twitter that “only ten turbulents have been able to maintain strength to be classified as tropical storms or lowers in shorter than 320 km from Phoenix from 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an orbital within 64 km from the border of Arizona."
The last predictions from the country's orchid center foretell 5-10 cm outfall, with a single result of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely that the result will be 2.5 cm to 5 cm in other areas of the southwest part, including the middle of the Rock Mountains and the Great Basin (The Great Basin), with the possibility of a single output up to 10 cm.
For those who are not in danger of sudden flooding, the result of Rosa may be a blessing because there are great drying in the area.
Although a flood can cause great harm, some of this result will have a positive effect, as dry is now in the southwest part.
According to the United States Dry Surveillance, at least over 40 percent of Arizona is very dry, but it's the second highest group," according to weather.com news.
First, Rosa's horror will reach a country on the Baja California sauna in Mexico.
Rosa was still grouped as turbulents on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and travels north at 19 km speed per hour.
The storm passes over the cooler sea in the Pacific, so his power is reduced.
Therefore, it is expected to land in Mexico as a tropical storm in the afternoon or on Monday evening.
There is a great potential in some areas in Mexico, with a significant risk of floods.
“The result is expected to be 7.5 to 15 cm in Baja California and into the northwest part of Sonora, with a potential of up to 25 cm outturn," said in a weather.com report.
Rosa will then keep north over Mexico, as a tropical storm, and then reach the border of Arizona early on the Tuesday morning as a tropical landscape. It will then continue through Arizona and come to the south of Utah late Thursday evening.
“ The entire danger that is expected to be from Russia or its remnant is a very great result in Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and the southwest desert area of the United States, ” said the orbital center of the country.
It is expected that these outcomes would cause life - threatening seizures and earthly movements in the wilderness, as well as mountains.

Trump said that Kavanaugh had “because of feeling evil and anger” from the Democratic Group out all his necessity process.

Hundreds of men died after a earthquake and a wave of floods in Indonesia, and likely to increase the number of dead
At least 384 people died, and many were swallowed away as an enormous waves of coasts, according to the authorities on Saturday, when a great earthquake and flood waves were over the Indian island of Sulawesh.
On Friday, hundreds of men had gathered on a festival on the coast of Pala, when up to six feet [6 m] high waves went on the beach at sunset, a number of people swallowed out on the sea, and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The flood wave was produced by a 7.5 - point earthquake on Richter.
“ When the horror was created yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not fled immediately, so they died, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian disaster institute, at a Jakarta information meeting.
“ The river did not come alone, she drew cars, tree drums, houses, she scraped all that was in the land, ” said Nugroho, adding that the river had traveled over the open sea at 800 miles [800 km] speed before she fell to the beach.
Some climbed up into a tree to escape the flood wave and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the disaster agency revealed many ruined buildings and shops, rotated and unnewd bridges, and mosque surrounded water.
Afternoons continued to ride over the coastal city on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was seen in a region of 2.4 million inhabitants.
India’s foundation on food and use of technology, stated that the energy released from the big trembling on Friday would have been about 200 times higher than from the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geographic location of the city, which is at the end of a long and tight flea, may have increased the size of the flood wave, said the Agency.
Nugroho said that the damages were “very” and that thousands of houses, hospitals, shops and hotels had crashed.
Like a number of victims, he was found to be trapped under a fall of buildings, and he added that 540 people had been harmful and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the loss of the land and the loss of the property could be more than 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, near the earthquake recording.
Communication “is completely down and no information is available” from Donggala, said Nugroho.
“ Over 300,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross in a declaration, adding that their staff and volunteers were on their way to the relevant areas.
“ This has already become a tragedy, but may become much worse, ” said the Red Cross.
The foundation was criticized by many on Saturday because they did not announce that a flood wave had fallen on Palu, although public representatives said that the waves had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
In a video published on the social media, one could hear from the upper height of buildings cries to warn the people on the street below about the approach of a flood wave.
Only a few minutes later, the river on the beach is beating off buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and the flood wave caused an electrical loss that prevented Palu from communicating and made it difficult for governments to organise helping.
The army is beginning to send airplanes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still need to keep food and other needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for assistance and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is going to visit Pala refugee centers on Sunday.
The number of deceased travels over 800 after a flood wave in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
The workforce of the World Vision from Donggala has reached the city of Palu, where it seeks refuge in tent cities set up in the garden outside their offices, according to Mr. Doseba.
"The people said they've seen many houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is very bad.
Acquisites have started hard helping work, but some have complained that abroad auxiliary staff with high expertise had been prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indian rules, foreign funding, supply and staff can only be started if the accident area is declared to be a disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“ This is still a local accident area, ” said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a disaster area, we can open for foreign assistance, but no declaration has yet been made."
When the second night fell upon Palu after the earthquake and the flood waves on Friday, friends and their families who are still missing kept in the hope that their loved one of the miraculous stories that cast hopes for the devastating predictions that follow natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was saved out of a boot.
On Sunday, helpers rescued a woman who had been trapped under ruins for two days with her mother’s body next to her side.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indian Swift Air Force, had been the trainer of two now missing Swift Flyers for the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Monday.
“As a man with long experience in a sweep, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that the hour after the news was born within the Swift Air Force because the Roa Roa Hotel had crashed, he had sent WhatsApp message in desperation to the competitors who lived in Pala and participated in the coastal festival.
On the other hand, his message showed only a cruel sign, instead of a blue.
“ I think it means that the messages were not received,” he said.

Kanye West: The Rape Changes His Name to Ye
Rape Kanye West is going to change his name - in Ye.
He announced the change in Twitter on Saturday and wrote: “The one previously known as Kanye West. ”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time, using the name as the title of his eighth album that came out in June.
The change occurs in his participation in the Saturday Night Live section, where he is expected to announce his new record, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi in the section, but she ceased “for sensible reasons, ” said the manufacturers.
West has previously said that this name has a religious meaning for him, but it is also a shortage of his present name.
“I think “ye” (ye) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means“you”, said West earlier in the year when he spoke the name of his record with the Big Boy radio manager.
“So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, and over to just Ye - to be just reflected on the good in us, the evil, the confused, all.
The plate is rather reflecting who we are."
He is one of many famous rocks that have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, former West co-worker, has also written his name with and without a band and a uppercase.
The President of Mexico promises not to use the army against public citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected President of Mexico, has promised never to use war against public citizens, now the silence of the country will soon remember the 50 - year - old birthday of the bloody revenge of students.
On Saturday on the Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised that “the army would never use the army to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers cast peaceful protests on the tower and dropped up to 300 people a time when the left - line movements of students were shooting roots throughout the United States.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving monthly strength to all students and opening more free public university.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational facilities lead young people to criminals.
The United States should double funds to satellitely defined
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of a satellite diagnostic, the United States should double the amount of funds it is doing in the field of research, says the inventor and the satellite operator Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statements were reported after the United States’ various departments issued communications on satellite, even though the United States has no formal satellite plan.
On the other hand, China announced its plan in the first place in the new creation by satellite for 2030.
“ It would be a good start to double the budget that is conducted in satellite research, given that all other countries are so much longer after the United States, and we are waiting to see the next big discovery in the field of satellite diagnostics, ” said Lee.
Duplicates of funds could double the chances of the next major discovery of satellite in the United States, said Lee to the CNBC interview this week.
Lee, author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the manager of the company Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the main satellite companies in China.
He worked on a satellite system in the 1930s at the Carnegie Mellon University, who worked the best player in the United States in Othello, and later was the executive of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese department at Google.
Lee spoke of the former technique races held by the U.S. authorities, such as the robotic contest of the Defense Department, and asked when the next race would be held, to see the next initials.
Scientists in the United States often need much to do to gain strength from the government, said Lee.
“ It’s not China that touches its main thoughts, but the company,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have advised their geniuses from high schools to work on the artificials of the last few years.
Lee said that changes in the immigrant policy could also help the United States to strengthen its satellite research.
“I feel that those who have a grade of physicians should automatically be allowed to stay,” he said.
China’s Congress published its future-defined programme in July 2017.
China’s Natural Science Agency provides funds for people who work at university institutes, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions in the United States, but the quality of science is worse in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the Defense Ministry of the United States launched a satellite center for cooperation with both industry and educational institutes, and the White House announced the creation of a special panel on satellite design.
And this month DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called "Al Next".
In the case of NSF, it invests over $100 million every year in satellite research.
At the same time, an American law, which was intended to create a satellite security advice, has not continued for several months.
Macedonians chose for a national consortium on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the inhabitants of Macedonia chose a national parliamentary fee on whether the country's name should be changed to the 'North Macedonia' in an attempt to resolve a decade-long conflict with Greece, which has closed their application for membership of the European Union and Nato.
Greece has a region named Macedonia and, therefore, claims that their neighbours in the north equivalent requirements in their territory and therefore refused to enter NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will bury the self - identity of the majority of Macedonian inhabitants of slave origin.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he will not participate in the voting and warfare to ignore it has raised doubts that participants will reach 50 percent of the minimum necessary so that the vote rate is considered to be valid.
The question of the vote is as follows: “Do you want to walk in Nato and the European Union by agreeing with Greece? ”
The supporters of the name change, including Zoran Zaev, Prime Minister, say that this is a fair fee for Macedonia to be a member of the Union and Nato, one of those created after Yugoslavia’s fall.
“I came today to choose the future of the country for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us, ” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although the conclusion is not legally binding, enough senators have said that they will follow it and bind it into law.
The name change would require the approval of two third parts of the session.
The Cosning Committee said that no unusual report had been reported at 1:00 a.m. after the afternoon.
However, the participation was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the final elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters paid their vote.
“ I came to choose for my children, our place is in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski, 62 - year - old chief in the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son Dushko paid their vote in the Macedonia National Assembly on whether to change the name of the country, but it would pay its way into NATO and the European Union, in Srumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the meeting in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, worked to prepare a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents that had been built by those who would ignore the vote.
"We are the Nato and the European Union, but we want to become members with a high head, not going through the service door," said Kavardarkov.
“ We are a poor land, but we have honor.
If they don't want to agree with us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the European Union."
President Zaev says that a member of Nato will transfer the necessary funds to Macedonia, where the proportion of the unemployed is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the largest majority will agree that more than 80 percent of the nationals are EU and Nato,” Zaev said after paying their vote.
He said that an agreement would be “a confirmation of our future. ”
A survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the National Assembly, which is less than the minimum required.
Another survey from Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were planning to pay their vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said to say yes.
In order to ensure that the national budget is valid, 50 percent of the total number of votes must be one.
If the vote is not accepted, it could mean the first serious shock for the Western government’s policy since its adoption in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, a player of Manchester City, passes through all the protection of Brighton and Scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made light the protection of Brighton in the victory of Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad scene in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy when he cut his goal in a 65 - minute.
At the beginning of the attendance, the Argentines received a shipment in the middle of the field.
He scattered over the three defenders of Brighton and then went out to the open court.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green - dressed defenders.
He met with one defendant and then escaped a few more just to the Vitateig Brighton.
Then he sent to the left and found Sterling there.
The English producer used the first touch within the vitry to send the ball back to Aguero, who used the right foot to play at Mathew Ryan, the Brighton target, with a shot on the right side of the target.
“Aguero deals with some football matters,” said Pep Guardiola, Executive Director of City, to newspapers.
“ We talked about his playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky he made a point at this moment."
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the superior departement game.
That target came in 29 minutes.
Aguero received a long transmission to the valley half of Brighton during that visit.
He sent a beautiful long ball on the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent to Sterling to the distance.
Mr. City sent the ball to the network just before he ran out.
City plays against Hoffenheim in the Master Board at 12.55 a.m. on Thursday at the Rhine-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a rash game against Rockies
Since Nationals have been excluded since playing in the finals, there was no great reason to force another beginning.
But the zealous Scherzer hopes to cast on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have the chance to get to the end, but they have a same game forehead over Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division.
Rockies received at least a “wildcard” seat with its 5-2 victory on the Nationals on Friday evening, but the team still seeks to reach its first section.
“ Even if we play free, we can at least play the game for the electrical atmosphere in Denver, as well as the other ones that are safe to play their best game this year.
Why shouldn't I want to compete with such circumstances?"
Nationals will still announce who will be the first caster in the game on Sunday, but they are thought to have Scherzer thrown in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who was playing for the 34th time, took a training course on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, a regular Sabbath with him.
This right-handed caster at Washington is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 windshots in 220 2/3 cycles during this playtime.
Trump Visits West Virginia
The president directed the case around Kavanaugh, a appointed Supreme Judge, when he spoke of the importance of the supporters of the reputations involved in the mid - time surveys.
“ All things are at stake in November.
There are five weeks in one of the most important choices of our life.
These are one of the big, big... I don't offer myself, but do it, so I'm going across the world to fight for great tenderers," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this terrible, radical group of democracy, you can see it happen now.
And they are determined to reap their control by any means you see cruelness, wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go to rule and rule, they just want power and government, we don't give it to them.
He said that the democrats were working to “strain and stop. ”
“ And it has been seen in the last four days, ” he said, “and said the Democrats are“ angry and evil and cruel and unreasonable. ”
He called the Chairman Dianne Feinstein, the Governor of the Democratic Committee of the Elderly Committee, on the name, and was answered with a loud trumpet from the audience.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Were you the one who swallowed the document?
Ha, what.
No, look, no, I waited for one... it was really a bad physical disposition, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The working group is no longer tolerant of a church.
He Does Not Endure Those Who Explain His Senses
When the Operational Events in my group chose to give me an order, it was hardly surprising.
After all, I am the last of many senators of the working party who have been told that we are not welcome, just because of expressing our minds.
Joan ryan, my council was treated similarly because she protested hardly against Jewish prejudice.
In my case, the claim to give me an order was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The matter was important to have responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar to that of Jeremy, who disagreed with former leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that “we want the meetings to not understand anything but to be successful. ”
In my eight years of work as the senator of the working party, the Friday meetings have been most frequently so.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of 'milder and better' politics has been forgotten if it ever started.
It has been increasingly evident that different views have not been over in the Workers Group and that all views are judged according to whether the leaders of the class consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, whom I previously thought to have similar political views as I, began to expect me to make a complete reconstruction and suggested views that I had never agreed before, whether it was about national security or a common EU market area.
Every time I speak publicly - and then little is what I say - then follows the tremendous social media that is called after my exclusion, the central politics denied, and tells me that I shouldn't be in the Working Party.
And this isn't just my experience.
I know that I am luckier than some of my colleagues, where most of my statements are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and confirmation of those who have to endure the holiness of sexual or prejudiceful offenses every day but never resume.
One of the most disappointing factors during this political period is how attacks and offenses have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Workers' Group should be a member of an impatient culture.
The reality is that we are no longer tolerant of the church, and with every lack of trust or change of choice, the group becomes increasingly three.
I have received many recommendations in the last two years to take little action, not to have too high, and then "all right" would be with me.
But I did not decide to participate in politics to do so.
Since I became a member of the Working Party as a student 32 years ago, encouraged by the neglect of the State government of Thatcher, who left my school room in depth, I have been fighting for better public service for those who need it most, whether in the city government or at the meeting.
I've never hidden my political views, nor my last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy views and where I disagree with the current leaders.
With those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes to Brexit, which will harm home, business and public service, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the Workers' Group.
But my only message that I want to send from me is not to Nottingham Moments, but to those within my corporation, whether they are members of the Workers' Group or not: I serve you with pride, and I promise that no threats about deviation or political exclusion will deceive me from doing what I think are for the best of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touch limits could have scared the final outcome something, but there is no doubt that Ayr had the victory divorced in this sudden game of the day in the Tennt's Premiership department.
They are now at the top of the list, and one of ten is still unconquered.
Eventually, it was their stronger defense and better use of opportunities that made homemen more victorious, and trainer Peter Murchie had the full right to be happy.
“We have had hard opposition in our games here and are still unconquered, so I must be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, said: “They deserve praise, they used their chances better than we do."
Mark Grant Anderson came over Ayr in 14 minutes after Frazier Climo turned the application, but a yellow card on the Scottish past, which was allowed to play the game with Warriors, made Melrose allowing the numbers to be spoken, and Jason Baggot reached the point of touch.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayr with a helmet before he kicked with a kick right for a half game and then touched the target and came Ayr over 17-5 in halfgame.
But Melrose started the second half of power and touching Patrick Anderson, after Baggot turned to, reduced the marking difference to five stages.
Then there was a long break in play for serious injuries at Ruaridh Knott, which had to bear out of playground, and after that, Ayr continued to increase his leadership with the touch of Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the attendance.
Blair Macpherson, the chief Ayr, then got the yellow card, and Melrose used to be a man with a touching target from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard visit.
On the other hand, homemen came strongly back, and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for switching Climo without the ball, MacPherson picked the target behind the Ayr visit, after an additional.
Climo turned the attendance to, as he did again immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe got fired David Amrstrong from Vitry and sent to Gregor Henry, who scored the fifth touch of the team.

“The Gospel is ours” means Bolivia’s coastal country hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The seas are guarded by La Paz’s headquarters.
General buildings flag the blue flag of the flag.
Flowers from the Titicaca water to the Amazon year are marked by the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It's our duty to recover it."
Around the rest of Bolivia’s landline, which lost to Chile in bloody conflicts in the 19th century, remained in my fourties - along with the desire to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes may be the strongest for decades, now that Bolivia is waiting for decisions from the International Court of Justice in Hague on October 1, after five years of proceedings.
“Bolivia has the power, the coalition spirit and the ointment, and, of course, waits for the decision with a positive mind,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a bolivian diplomate.
Many inhabitants of Bolivia will monitor the decision of the International Court of Justice on a large scale throughout the country, in the hope that the Court of Justice in Hague will decide Bolivia in favour of their claim that Chile is obliged to give Bolivia access, after many decades of difficult conversations.
The Monday surgery is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the country of Indian families, which will have a controversial struggle for the next year’s re-course.
“ We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised late August.
However, some detectors unlikely believe that the court decided Bolivia in favour, and that if he did so, it would change little.
The Court of Justice, which has headquarters in the Netherlands, has no power to give a country from Sile and has stated that the decision will not affect the conclusion of possible discussions.
The fact that the court’s decision comes only six months after listening to the final talks indicates that the matter “had not been complicated, ” said Paz Sárate, a silent expert in international law.
It is also possible that in the last four years Bolivia has not been important but has resulted in the return of the country.
“The current government of Bolivia has stolen the matter of access to the sea,” Zarate said.
Morale's rebellious speech has reduced all the goodwill of Sile, she said.
Bolivia and Sile will at some time continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
Since 1962, the two countries have not skipped ambassadors.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and representative of the country in Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision had taken an exceptionally short time.
On Monday Bolivia will receive “a unique opportunity to open up for a new relationship with Sile” and the opportunity to“ end up a disagreement that reaches 139 years in time, both countries to benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also refused that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents in Roman America, would use this matter as a political increase.
“ Bolivia will never give up his right to have access to the Pacific,” he added.
“ The investigation is an opportunity to see that we need to cope in the past.”
North Korea says that nothing will be of nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, foreign minister of North Korea says that the country will never take down its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He invited the United States to follow the promises they made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His statements come now, Mike Pompeo, U.S. foreign minister, seem to be about restarting discussions on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea.
Mr Ri says that it is a "threem" to hold the continuation of business and contradictions of the United States against the declaration of the end of the Korea war will ever kneeze North Korea.
Washington doesn't want to accept the statement unless Pyongyang first takes the action to reduce its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, President of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there are great doubts that Pyongyang is seriously taking down weapons that the country probably considers as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Art showers in Paris present the latest line of large headwears that will come in style shops near you
If you want to expand your hat library or be completely hidden from the sun, you don't have to look longer.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a multitude of magnificent hats in sizes for their SS19 line in the style area that greeted the tattoo on the fashion week in Paris.
Instagram has been published in summer, a number of very unhappy hats, and these designers have had their new creations for a show of fashion.
The main work after Valentino was a large brown hat with wide vessels like the feathers and hiding the heads of the mudles.
Of other excessive components, water melons could be seen sets of juices, cockpit hats, and even ananas, but these are not designed to keep heat on their heads.
Thom Browne also introduced many kinds of strange masks, precisely at the right time for a witchwake.
Many of the colorful masks were composed with lips and rather like Hannibal Lecter than high - tea.
One mask was similar to a respiratory pipe and glasses, while others were similar to ice in the bread form.
Well, if you want to get tolerated, you're lucky.
Technical experts foretell that the big hats could soon be sold in the style shop nearby you.
Large hats get a dose of “La Bomba”, a strawhat with more than 60cm of loads that have sprayed heads from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion mark behind the very unhappy hat, seen in all social media, was inspired to another large part that appeared in the style area — a beach bag of a throat that was almost as large as the dizzy metal that carried it.
The appelsinous stradbag, with strawbars and white arms of leather, was the main part of the La Riviera SS10 garment line Jacquemus on the fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage, the artist of the famous people, interviewed FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beach bags appear in the style shop for the next summer - where the designer has caused such a great influence, it should be difficult to ignore the demands for surpluses. ”
John Edward: Language skills are needed for world citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding results of their students, and they have continued in 2018 with new, glorious trials, which are still strengthened with individual and group successes in sports, artists, music and other societies.
These schools have up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, with The Scotish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in defence for them, and they strive to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools suggest that they prepare their students for further studies, the career they have chosen, and their status as world citizens.
As a teacher who can compile and teach according to specific study files, we will see that new things continue to be a popular study material in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother's language, it touches his heart."
This is an important reminder that we cannot only trust in English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The test results of this year show us that language is the top of the lists with the highest proportions of students who reach trials in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned a foreign language received the A.
The data collected from 74 schools in SCIS showed that 72 percent of students received the quality score A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign language as the necessary skills of children and young people will certainly need to be kept in the future.
At the moment, languages, as a dictionary, are set in the same place as science - related study material (scientific, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that for the reasons that employers stated that it was difficult to handle employment, 17 percent was because people with language skills were lacking.
Thus, language knowledge is increasingly important to prepare young people for their future tasks.
Now that more and more jobs require knowledge in languages, this ability is necessary in a world of worlds.
No matter what career people choose, it will have a real priority in the future if they learn another language, but it is a knowledge that lasts their life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a larger person a presumption on the rivals.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak a language well enough to conduct conversations, and French was the only language that was spoken of two characters of percentages, or 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important for modern - day children to invest immediately in language learning.
Multiplicity, especially in newly marketed countries, will give children a better opportunity to find a significant job.
In Scotland, schools differ from which language they teach.
A certain number of schools will focus on classical new things, while others will teach languages that are considered most important for Britain when viewed by 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, it will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Schools in Scotland are obliged to offer a study environment that will prepare children and prepare them with the skills they need to achieve success, no matter what the future will bring.
It cannot be refused that language is still necessary for the future of the country at this time, in a noble business environment, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as “international knowledge of relations. ”
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity, and superiority to the young people of Scotland.
Il runs bien le faire.

LeBron plays his first game for Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is soon to end for fans who want to see LeBron James play their first game for Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, trainer Lakers, has announced that James will play on Sunday in the opening game of Denver Nuggets, San Diego.
It has not yet been decided for how many minutes he will play.
“ It will be longer than one minute and shorter than 48, ” said Walton on a public website of Lakers.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for Lakers, said on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited time.
After exercising this week, James was asked for his plans for six plays of the Lakers program before the start of the playtime.
“ During this period of my course, I don’t have to play games for the playtime to prepare myself, ” he said.
Time-limits for the Trump election meeting in Western Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of elections and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five organized meetings next week, where he will also stop at friends, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the confirmation of his election to the new Supreme Court has been delayed, with Trumped to build up support for the next mid-term examinations, the repumblers are at risk of losing control over the session when voting is paid in November.
What time is the Trump vote in Western Virginia, and how can you look at him on the Internet?
The meeting of Trump in Wheeling, Western Virginia, is to start at 7:00 a.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia on the Internet below through the direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to judge the court proceedings against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Judge, where excited because of the accusations of sexual action.
But the main goal of Trump meetings is to help the repumbles to reach a better step, but they are waiting for difficult votes in November.
Thus, the Trump’s election campaign announced that these five meetings, which will be held next week, aimed at “completing volunteers and supporters of spirits trying to protect and increase the majority of them in the elders and in the meeting, ” according to Reuters newspaper.
“The administration of the Assembly is so necessary for the President’s plan that it will travel to as many Member States as it is already possible to start an adjacent military period," said an unnamed spokesman from the Trump’s election campaign at Reuters’ newsroom.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium of Wheeling, and supporters will come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and that media from Pittsburgh tell about it,” according to the West Virginia Metro News news agency.
The meeting on Saturday will be another visit to Trumps to Western Virginia this month, but he won with more than 40 percent in this area in 2016.
Trump wants to help Patrick Morrissey, the representative of the reputations in Western Virginia to the elders, but he's at the bottom of the surveys.
“ It is not a good idea for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity, ” said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters newsroom.
Ryder Beker 2018: The United States shows a fighting will to keep the hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one - sided rings, the four game, which was late Saturday, could be exactly what was needed in this race about Ryder’s bike.
Swimming in success is a sport that has been discovered and that players truly believe in, and never more than in the race as this.
Where would they say that success is now?
“ They had six stages forehead, and now it is four points, so that success is rather on our side now, I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he started in the race of the day.
Of course, Europe has a predecessor, four stages in the past, with twelve additional steps.
The Americans, as Spieth said, think they have some wind in their seals, and they can be hopeful over many, especially the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and who got three points of four.
Spieth has played greatly all the way to track and lead with his example.
The joy group increased as a way to the ring, and he put down an important poot to hire all the four stages in the game after he and Thomas had been two points below after two moves.
His poet, who guaranteed them the victory of the 15th hole, was like a joyous cry, cried of the kind that tells a man that he believes that the United States is not yet a victory hope.
"You just have to dive deeply and think about your own game," said Spieth.
That's the only thing these players can now.
18 holes to get in.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indispensable story of Ryder's bike.
This weird, but fascinating European couple have won four of four games and cannot do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who received a swollen afternoon on Saturday, but they also avoided swallows on Saturday morning, afternoon on Friday and on the nine holes on Friday morning.
The game and how their energy seem to flow both to and from the loud audiences clearly shows that they are the pair that needs to be victory on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team, but Fleetwood or Molinari, which sets the sun over the Le Golf National.
The best option would be that both did it at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went lightly with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the four games in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
On the first nine holes, the shoes and two doubles grew the Spanish and Sweden into a hole that they never got out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fours and fours are so exciting to look closely because of the communication between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how a playtable can change in one area.
Europe has played better as a team here and has a considerable advance for the end of the day, but these four gaps also showed that the U.S. team had the will of struggle that some had doubted that it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with a 10-6 leadership for the final day of the race on Ryder's bike
Europe will have a good precedent for the final day of Ryder's cup after four bullets and four hours of Saturday, with the 10-6 forecast against the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, the starry victory, led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who had difficulty, and had four points on the Le Golf National Veld.
The European team Thomas Bjorns, who would like to get the prize beaker back, which it lost the Hazeltine Velde two years ago, showed great superiority to the United States in the morning's four-cubic game and won 3-1.
The United States showed more opposition in the four games and worked two games but did not get the score difference.
Jim Furik’s team needed eight stages from 12 individual games on Sunday to continue the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European new man who wins four points in order, and he and Molinari, who took the name “Molliwood” after a wonderful weekend, are only the second couple that wins four points from their first four games in Ryder’s history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four - bullet game, they showed a great team and won the downward Woods and the U.S. Newman Bryson Dechambeau 5 - 4.
Woods, who drew himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius several times, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball games and four games, and seven of them in order.
Justin Rose, who was restored before the morning's four-hour game, came back to his companion, Henriks Stenson in the four games, and they worked 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are in the first and third place on the list of the best golfers in the world.
However, Europe did not go all the way in this mild and ugly day southwest of Paris.
A threefold winner in golf, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for Americans with two stages on Saturday.
They worked with difficulty 2-1 against Jon Rahm from Spain and Ian Poulter in four bullets and later came back and conquered Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the four games after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in Ryder’s history that the team has worked up four stages, at the beginning of individual competition, although Furik’s team had only to keep on with the cup.
However, after being the next for two days, they seem to be overwhelmed as a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says the unilateral disarmament of "inconsistent" without confidence
On Saturday, Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea said STH that the continuing business requests were only in their lack of confidence in the United States, and it would be impossible for the country to take down its nuclear weapons alone under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said on the annual General Assembly of the STH that North Korea had taken action to show goodwill in the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and fireplace tests, reducing nuclear testing sites, and promiseing to cease developing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“ However, we have not seen any similar reactions from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to take our nuclear weapons down on a single side first.”
Although Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to the 'stead-by-step' approach to nuclear weapons, where North Korea was rewarded for every step that it had taken, his statement appeared to be special in order not to deny a single-side nuclear weapon purely as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to the joint statements Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the President of the United States and the leader of North Korea, in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work on the “Corean nuclear weapons” and Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought solutions to bind a formal end to the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must leave its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also been invited to suspend a strict trade ban against North Korea.
“The United States demands that nuclear weapons should take place first” and increase pressure by using commercial calls to achieve their performance, even protesting the declaration of an end to the war,” said Ri.
“ There are only dreams of people who don’t know about us to think that business prayers can knee us.
But the problem is that continuing business requests increase our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump, which the leader of the United States talked about at STH before the week.
Instead, the Governor spoke of three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, leader of South Korea in the last five months, adding: “If the member of this nuclear weapons issue was South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be the point in the matter of nuclear weapons on the Koreans. ”
In spite of this, the tone in Ri was very different from his speech in the past when he said at the General Assembly SD that it was inevitable to centre firefoots from North Korea to the main country of the United States after the “the Devilly President” Trump called Kim“ Fireman” for suicide.
Last year, Trump threatened to “destruct” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to take steps towards disarmament, but said that much work was still left and that business prayers would have continued until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time frames about this, saying: “If this takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter. ”
China and Russia say that the SD Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
On Thursday, however, Mike Pompeo, U.S. foreign minister at the STH Security Council, said: “The Security Council’s communication requests must continue until complete nuclear weapons have taken place and confirmed it. ”
The Security Council agreed to increase trade relations with North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to close funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and firecraft plans.
Pompeo met Ri on the side line at the SD and said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times a year, but his last trip did not go well.
He went from Pyongyang to July and said that success had been achieved, but only a few hours later, North Korea condemned him for “appreciating demands. ”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to take down fireplaces and nuclear stations if the United States attacked "comparative operations".
He said that Kim had told him that the “according actions” he was looking for were security assurances promised by Trump in Singapore and actions towards normal relations with Washington.
Students in Harvard take a course in sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to resist the growing tendency of students to wake up and learn all night with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study revealed that students at the world’s best university often know little and nothing when the basics come to mind themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor in sleep healing at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes that it sees the first species in the United States.
He received the idea of doing the course after reading about the effects of a lack of sleep on a napolete.
“ At the end of the lecture a girl came to me and asked, “Why is this first told me in my final year? ”
She said that no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he said to Teelegraph.
The first time of a year’s study explains to students the basic elements of how good sleep habits help namsget and performance in sports and even contribute to general welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrists at Harvard’s Medical School and head of the School’s Health Service, said that the college had decided to present the course after discovering that students were very nausea over the week.
The course is an hour in length and includes a number of useful tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a room in the home, where students click on coffee balls, window tents, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports can worsen with a lack of sleep, along with the importance of a good busy for sleep.
In other parts, participants are told how a shortage of sleep to a long time may increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the school area with interactive signs then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“ We know that this will not change the conduct of students.
But we think they have the right to know this, just as you have the right to know of the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that commends those who are awake and learn the whole night is still present, he said and added that modern technology and high pressure on students meant that a lack of sleep was growing.
The assurance of getting enough sleep of good quality should be “free” students to defend stress, tired, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid fat, because a lack of sleep increases the brain's call for food so that the body is climbing.
Raymond So, 19-year-old in chemical and physics from California, helped Professor Czeisler to set the course together, but he sat one of the professor’s courses in the last year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students at school.
He hopes that the next step will have to ask all masters to complete a similar course before they start a university study.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students intend to set up a vacuum clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them, and keep in mind the harmful effects from blue light as electrical screens and LED lights give from themselves, but it can confuse the inner clock of the body and lead to trouble falling into sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrards
Rangers still had problems in the field where Stevens Gerrard's broken team had to meet with 1-0 loss of Livingston, after a target from Dolly Menga.
Ibrox wanted to win his first victory after his victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt gave Gerrard's team only his second loss in his 18 games as executive manager. The team is now eight stages after Hearts, which is at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership department.
Menga scored seven minutes for halfgame and the team of Rangers seemed to lack all inspired and was never likely to balance.
Now Rangers fall to the sixth seat, while Livingston goes up to the third and is only after Hibernian in the target difference.
Rangers may be in further trouble after the linenman Calum Spence had to receive attention because of headache after any object was thrown into him from the valley half of the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that swept Ayr away and came in the outlook of Betfred Becher.
Holt, however, retained the same Livi 11 setup that reached the stage of Hearts last week, and he had been pleased with how well trained his officers chose the opposition.
Rangers may have been more with the ball, but Livingston created more opportunities with the balls it achieved.
They should have scored only two minutes after the start of the game when the first mission from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allans McGregors, but he shot over.
A long biopsy from Keaghan Jacobs then ended with Craig Halkett, while Alan Lithgow, his guardian, shot over the distance.
Rangers again got control over the game, but seemed to live in hope rather than belief in his game in the final third party of the game.
Alfredo Morales surely felt that he should have been assassinated when a quarter of the game was over, when he and Steven Lawless were assembled, but judge Steven Thomson rejected the call of the Columbian.
Rangers only reached two shots in the first half game, but Liam Kelly, former targeter Ibrox, did not have much to defend a scalp from Lassana Coulibaly and easy shots from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opportunity from Livi in a 34th minute had come, no one can deny that they deserved, but only because of their perseverance.
On the other hand, Rangers failed to do something from Jacob’s long additional question.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose to send to Menga, which then made it easy.
Gerrard took his advice in halfgame and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibaly and the exchange had effect closer immediately when the backkeeper came in Morelos, but Kelly quickly responded and ran forward to close the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to fool the guests to play exactly the type of game they like to play, and Lithgow and Halkett reached each long consignment to the other.
L. Holts could have increased his leadership in the final amines, but McGregor was well in refusing Jacobs for an opportunity before Lithgow ran out of the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a reputer of Rangers, wanted another asshole when he and Jacob fell down together, and Thomson rejected it from again.
Almanak: The man who found the Geiger tentator
Here comes a page from our "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and ÁFRAM... this is the day that future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to study and measure radioactivity, and the invention eventually led to a device called Geiger’s measurement.
The Geiger norm has gained a fixed seat in the scientific world since it, but was also popular in the pope culture, for example in the film “Bells of Coronado” from 1950, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in different roles as scientists:
You say, “What in the case of this is this? ”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s recommendation, used to find radioactive substances such as uranium.
When you put this hearing on you, you can hear the influence of atoms because of the radioactivity of the stones."
Evans said: “There is really going to go now! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention of his name continues to live.

Then they can “see” protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and then injected again in the patient
Experimental vaccines have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to know dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and changing them to a laboratory so that they can “see” protein called HER2 and appear in many types of cancer. Then the cells are injected again in the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the United States Crafts Agency in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our sites indicate that the vaccine is very effective. ”
HER2 “does some types of cancer stop growing”, including breast cancer, ovarian, lungs, and convulsion, said professor Berzofsky.
Similar methods in which immune cells are taken from patients and those known to attack cancer cells have been active in the treatment of one type of leukaemia.
Kanye West conducted a long discussion for supporting Trump, and MAGA derhufu after having been presented in the SNL TV.
It didn't end well
After a long - term talk at Kanye West in the Studio of Saturday Night Live, he commended President Donald Trump and said he would offer himself to President in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he carried Make America Great Derhufu, he spoke long against democratics and repeated his support for Trump.
“ I have so often spoken to white people who say: “How do you like Trump, he is a race hater? ”
If I were concerned about racial hatred, I would have been transferred from the United States for a long time," he said.
SNL started the part with a stick where the Hollywood Star Matt Damon laughed at the Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Judge Committee of the Elderly Department because of the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford on sexual incitement.
Although West wasn’t sent out, the recording of it was placed on a social media of the jokemakers Chris Rock.
I don't know if Rock wanted to laugh to West by publishing the recording.
West also complained to the audience that he had received a bad reverse for his hub choice.
“ I was put in a backbone.
They said to me, “Don’t go up to the stage with this derhube. ”
They put me in jail!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news from Washington Examiner.
West continued: “Would you see the deep hole? ” and said that he would put on his superhero cake,“ because that means you can’t set me for work, do you want the world to progress?
Try the love."
According to Variety, his statements were made with a trumpet from the audience at least twice, and SNL’s actors seemed to be the most precious, and one attended said to the magazine: “There was a stone silence in the studio. ”
West had been invited to take part in the place of the singer Ariöna Grande, but her boyfriend, the raper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his scenery when he sang the song I Love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, chairman of TPUSA’s team, who said on Twitter: “To one of the most courageous souls: BE THAT THAT THINK THINK THAT THE MUGN MUST. ”
But the chat director Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply being “he himself and it is quite wonderful. ”
“But I did not choose to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “list”) that I feel to support and distribute ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
That's what we are, too," she added.
Before the show, the raper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now “a being known as Kanye West. ”
He is not the first artist to change the name and follow the footsteps of Diddy, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another raper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion, and must not forget the musical idolatry of Prince, who turned his name into a symbol and later called himself the artist who was previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticized toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for her role as Jon Snow in the violent adventure of the HBO, the Crown Games.
However, the 31 - year - old player has criticized the statue of the male hero and says that such a role on the screen often means that young boys feel that they need to be harsh in order to gain respect.
In a interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he believed that “something went wrong” and wondered how to cope with the problem of toxic manhood at the #MeToo period.
Kit, who recently married her wife from the Crown Games, the 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “great opinions” on how to deal with this matter.
"Personally I feel at the moment - what has gone wrong with maleness?"
“What have we taught men in their upbringing, about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increased toxicity, due to very male persons on television.
He continued: “What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught on television and outdoor streets that make young boys feel like they must be determined by a man?
I think it's one of the most important questions in the same time - how do we do this?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not play in any other Crownity factors after the next summer series, saying that he had “found enough of armies and horses. ”
From November to November, Kit will play in the reconstruction of True West, a picture of Sam Shepard, which tells the story of the film manufacturer and his robber brother.
The player recently said that the best thing to have played in the Crown Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
“ I met my wife in these things, so that they gave me somehow my future family and my life after that, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a dear Jon Snow, and Kit played in this Emmy Prize.
The couple married in June 2018, in the country of Lesli’s family in Scotland.
HIV/ AIDS: China reports about 14% increase in new infections
China has reported about 14% increase in the number of people infected by the HIV virus or have AIDS.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The majority of new infections occurred with sex, a change from the previous.
Earlier, the HIV virus was rapidly spread in some countries of China due to the administration of infected blood.
On the other hand, the number of people infected by the HIV virus has fallen to nearly zero, as Chinese healthcare professionals said at a Yunnan district conference.
However, the number of people infected by the HIV virus or AIDS has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection caused by sex is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but there is still a great difference between LGBT people.
Due to the country's sustained values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who engage in sex with other men are finally married to a woman.
Many infections will be caused by inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised access to HIV medicines as part of the programme to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that the employee has filed data from the Senior Assembly's offices, criticized the 'threatening lies' and 'cosership teachings'
Maxine Waters, a council rejected on Saturday the accusations that one of her employees had published personal information from the three elders of the Republic of Republic on their Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles said that these claims were from “the superior” perverses and websites.
“ Liars, lies, and more bad lies, ” said Waters in Twitter’s statement.
According to the addresses and phone numbers of the United States Senators Lindsey Graham from South Caroline and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information was published on the Internet on Thursday from an unknown party at Capitol Hill during the hearing at the Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court, due to the accusations of sexual action.
The game came sometime after the three Senators had consulted Kavanaugh.
Consequently, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP numbers that acknowledge the information source were associated with Water's office and published information on one of its employees, according to Capitol Hill's information.
“ This unsuccessful accusation is totally wrong and pure lie, ” Waters continued.
“ My associate - which personal information and safety are now at risk for these wrong accusations - was in no way responsible for this information system.
This unjust accusation is totally wrong and pure lie."
Water’s statement was rapidly criticized on the Internet, including Ara Fleischer, former White House Reporter.
“ This denial is full of anger, ” wrote Meater.
“ It suggests that she does not have the ability to sit at a meeting.
When a person is accused of reasonlessly, do not react with anger.
It must not show opposition.
This should not be questioned for reasons of accusation.
It must show calmness and conscience."
Kater seemed to compare Water’s reaction to the criticism of the Democratic Judge of Kavanaugh, who critics said that had seemed to be too angry at the trials on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the producing reputations against Waters in the mid - time surveys, also said his view on Twitter.
“ Great, if true, ” he cried.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had “notified the appropriate authorities and police officers of these unfair claims.
“ We will make sure that the guilty ones will be found, ” she continued, “and they will be charged for all the deeds that are harmful and dangerous for all my servants. ”
A film graphic for Johnny English Strikes again - a spy graph with Rowan Atkinson proves a little
It has become used to search for Brexit’s references in all new forms of history, and this seems to be true of this resurrection in the Johnny English fun series - which began in 2003 with the picture Johnny English and just awakened back to life in 2011 with the picture Johnny English Reborn.
Will this cancer satira about how obviously embarrassed we are to be a new land export facility?
Whether it is true or not, Johnny English has received a renewed permit for the second time to scratch everything - his name shows above all that he is creative for a show in other English - speaking countries.
Of course, he is the wise secret serviceman who seems to live over thrilling personal magic but is a little mix of Clouseau, that of Mr. Bean and a little bit of the man who played one note for Chariot of Fire at the opening festival of the Olympics in London in 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the mysterious world citizen at Atkinson’s once played in the forgotten Barclaycard television ads, where he disregarded everything.
There's one or two good points in this latest Johnny English picture.
I enjoyed seeing Johnny English walking to a helicopted medieval brown, and helicopters went into his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his jokefulness, but the humor seems rather powerful and strangely surrounded, especially now already “severy” movies like James Bond and the Mission Impossible also offer fun.
The joke seems rather intended for children than adults, and I felt the adventures that Johnny English did not have as imaginative and concentrated as the silences of Atkinson's jokes in Mr. Beans.
The everlasting reason for the picture is that Britain is in great trouble.
A computer operator has come to break into the British secret spy network and has raised the identity of all British spyers, to a great extent for the spear who is on the watch - which, unfortunately, Kevin Eldon is in too little role.
This is the final tour of the Prime Minister, who is a profound and controversial person, and who is already in great trouble because of enormous political opportunities: Emma Thompson does his best with his role as a person to remind of Theresu May, but the manuscript is not on many fish for it.
Her counselors tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had been set up in a holy stone.
And there comes Johnny English to the story, now a school manager at some fine school, but also gives secret teaching in how to be a spyer: here are some funny jokes when English offers a spy school that reminds of the School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall at an emergency meeting and there meets Bough, his former long - tired companion, who Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine manager, but in that energy role, Vicki Pepperdine does not completely let her light shine.
The spy - natrium that screws everything in her Majesty's service is now back to the girl and meets the Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olgu Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is striving from the magic of the charming billions of the technology giraffe, which says that it can be solved from the British computer problems: it is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their luxury missions: they fire in a fine French restaurant encrypted as a servant, they cause usles when they smuggle into the luxury jacket of Volta, and English turns everything around when he tries to use the virtual glasses to explore the inside of the House of Volta.
There is nothing to save in the final point, but although the image is resistant and energyful, some of the child’s material in it is in its entirety.
Medium stuff.
And just as with the other Johnny English pictures, I couldn't think: Can a British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his skills?
The working group refuses to create a four-day workweek plan for the UK, with the same wages as five days ago.
The working group, under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, now considers a radical plan that would allow the British to work for four days a week, but get paid for five.
Accordingly, the group wants companies to make use of savings made from the revolution in satellite, and to make employees benefit from having one extra holiday.
In that case, staff may enjoy three days of a long weekend, without lowering the wages.
Sources say that the idea would be "pass" to the Group's economic plan and its policy of improving the interests of the workforce.
The Trade Union Congress has supported the reduction of the week's work for four days, which led the workforce to take advantage of economic changes.
A source from the Upper Group of Workers said to the Sunday Times: “It is estimated that a policy review should be reported before the end of the year.
“The breakdown will not be in one night, but four days of working weeks are the objective of the group’s approach to changing the economy for the benefit of the workforce and the overall industrial policy of the group.”
The working group would not be the first group to support this idea, but the green group promised four days of work in its election campaign in 2017.
However, the aim is not supported by the Workers’ Group as a whole.
The Speaker of the Working Party said: “The four days of working weeks are not on the political newspaper of the class, and the group is not considering introducing it. ”
John McDonnell, the Chemical Minister of Business, used the Workers Group Conference last week to describe his ideas of social revolution within the economy.
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to re-elect the "unknown managers" and "producers" providers.
The plans of the shadow Minister also translated that the current shareholders of the water vessels may not get all of their part back, since the State government of the Workers' Group could put on “deduction” due to injured crimes.
It has also confirmed the plans to set workers into management committees and to create a shared property fund to allow 10 percent of the property of private enterprises to their staff, who could get 500 pounds of them in their pocket every year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say "60 minutes" whether the FBI study at Kavanaugh could cause them to change their views
The FBI’s investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a weekly delay in the final payment of his appointment to the Supreme Judge, and raises the question of whether its findings could cause the Senior Divisions to withdraw their support.
In a Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, reporter in the “60 minutes” section of the reputations and the Senior Assembly, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked whether the FBI could reveal something to change their views.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colonel from South Caroline.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“ When the trial began, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the accusations were put forward and asked, “Do you do this? ”
He was determined, steadfast, distinguished."
Graham’s comments, however, seem to be unchanged.
“ I have made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have an incredible accusation to change it, ” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but this I know: Brett constantly refused,” Graham added and addressed Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And all her names couldn’t confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old case.
I can't see anything new will change."
What is the international civil celebration and has it done something to reduce poverty?
The International Citizen Festival (Global Citizen Festival) will be held on Saturday in New York, a yearly music event, where the series of great stars will appear and with a similarly powerful policy; to end poverty worldwide.
This is the seventh year of the international civil celebration, and tens of thousands of people will be moved to Central Park, not only to listen to musical elements, including Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real goal of the celebration of ending severe poverty before 2030.
The International Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is part of the International Poverty Project (Global Poverty Project), which is an international campaign that wants to end poverty by increasing the number of those fighting it.
In order to get free notes of the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP), music visitors needed to complete various projects, or “operations”, such as working volunteer work, sending emails to some of the world’s leaders, calling or using other valid ways to help make attention to their goals to end poverty.
But how much has the celebration been accomplished, now that 12 years are in progress to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of paying people with free music really a way to convince people about calling for operations, or is this just a so-called "small operation" - where people feel that they do something important by signing a demand list on the Internet or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million ‘operations’ from its supporters to call for many different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped the world’s leaders to describe commitments and directions equal to over $35 billion, which will affect life over 2.25 billion before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and notifications due to its operations, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have been directly affected by nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main liabilities comes from The Power of Nutrition, a company of investors and executive managers in Britain who are working to “help children to enjoy their enjoyment fully”, and promised to give 35 million dollars to Rwanda to help to end their undernovate in the country, after transferring 4700 messages on Twitter from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the British Government, strengtheners, governments all over the world and international citizens like you, we can make it socially unfair to the past," said Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition to the audiences in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 calls were sent that the United Kingdom should add food to mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and will provide them with better nutrition.
In a list of common questions on the group’s website, one such question is: “Why do you think you can put an end to severe poverty? ”
Global Citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult task – sometimes we will fail.
But, we will reach our limits, just like movements that struggled for the rights of citizens and the rejection of race separation before us, because we are stronger together.
Among those on the event this year, Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe. The event will be held in New York, and the students are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the marine army as a 'inhibitor' to prevent Russia''s energy exports, says the Intergovernmental Minister.
“ If necessary, ” Washington could use the marine army to prevent Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, says Ryan Zinke, U.S. Intergovernmental Minister of the United States, report from Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s aid to Syria, especially where the country is working for the legalty of the government there, was a proposal to explore new markets.
“I think the reason for their beings in the Middle East is that they want to do business with energy as in Eastern Europe and its southern part," he should have said according to the sources.
And, according to a public announcement, there are ways and methods to explore it.
“The United States can use the marine army to ensure that seaways are open and, if necessary, to create obstacles to the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed a guest meeting invited the Consumer Energy Alliance, a well-establishment group calling himself "the voice of energy consumption dance" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying that she was more or less the same.
“ The financial choice for Iran and Russia is more and less beneficial to energy donations and to share them with others, ” he said, and said Russia has only one card in the arrogance with economics dependent on petroleum fuel.
The statements result from the fact that Trump's control wants to increase its export of gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a far cheaper option for European consumers.
To do so, officials in Trump's control, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to force Germany to cease participating in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 task of putting a new power guide, which Trump says would make Berlin “fish” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the 11 billion dollars of Nord Stream 2 energy management, which will double the current transport capacity up to 110 billion meters, is only an economic project.
Russians say that strong opposition to Washington’s mission is simply ongoing for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“ I think we do not share the view that energy cannot be a tool to use pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the beer, ” said Aleksandr Novak, Russia’s Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, U.S. Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The state of the United States has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Federation of German Industry (BDI) has called on the United States not to interfere with the EU’s energy policy and a double-sided agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
“I am very inconsistent with the fact that the foreign government divided from our power station,” said Dieter Kempf, President of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with Angelu Merkel, the German Chancellor, and Vladimir Putin, President of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will be inviting herself to the Presidential Office in 2020, says she.
Elizabeth Warren, Senior Assembly of Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she would “think seriously” to offer herself to President after the mid-term elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider offering herself to a civil meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“ It’s time for women to go to Washington and arrange our government, and then also needs a woman as a leader,” she reported from The Hill.
“After November 6, I will consider seriously inviting myself to the President’s office.”
Warren spoke of President Donald Trump at the meeting, saying that he was “going the land in the wrong direction.
“ I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been obsessed with his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Judge.
On Friday Warren at Twitter said that “we must, of course, let the FBI investigate the matter before the vote is made."
However, a survey published on Thursday shows that the majority of the voters in Warrens Member States do not think that it should be offered in 2020.
Fifty-five percent of the "like" voters in Massachusetts said that the Senior Division should not offer himself, according to an opinion published by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent said to support her presentation.
The study showed greater support for Deval Patrick, former government manager, as 38 percent claimed to support his possible presentation, and 48 percent said that they were opposed to it.
Among other popular democrats discussed for the possible presidential presentation in 2020, Joe Biden, former president of the Reserve, and Bernie Sanders, Senior Assembly of Vermont.
Biden said that he was going to make a public decision in January, according to a report from the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks of a shock disorder in Track Palin at a Donald Trump election meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, was in Iraq for a year after he joined the army in September.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
“My son is going through great difficulties after coming back, I feel with other families who experience the effects of stress and the spiritual wounds with which our soldiers return home,” she said to the audiences at a Donald Trump vote in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the fool in the room ” and said that her son and other warriors“ would come back only differently, they are tough and wondered whether any respect was given to their companions in the army and the air force and the other divisions of the army for the land. ”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent a report on domestic violence and weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, the police officer in Wasilla.
18 Districts and Washington D.C. support challenges against a new refugee policy
An eighteen state and Washington City support a legal challenge against the new US policy that denies victims that flee from trafficking or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 and the city sent a court report on Friday in Washington to support a refugee seeker who opposes the approach, according to NBC News report.
The full name of the accuser in Grace v. Sessions' laws submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Policy has not been released.
She said that her spouse “and his violent sons, who were associates, ” used violence to her, but on July 20, American employers rejected her application for refuge.
She was put in a warrant in Texas.
The defendants who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where problems with gambling and domestic violence are increasing.
The new refugee leadership revokes a decision adopted by the Recommendation Committee of Immigrants in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants who escaped domestic violence to seek refuge.
Karl Racine, State Attorney Washington, stated on Friday that the new approach “decades of national and international laws were overwhelming. ”
“The United States law requires a decision on all securitisation applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this approach violates this rule,” said the Court of Justice.
In the report, the lawyers stated that the approach that refused immigrants to enter would be harmful for the United States' economy, and argued that the immigrants would be more likely to create businesses and “have important labour power."
Jeff Sessions, State Attorney, appointed judges in immigrant matters to stop giving refuge to victims who fled from domestic violence and ravage in June.
“ Those who leave their homeland because of persecution based on races, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political views may seek refuge, ” said Sessions in its announcement on 11 June.
Confessions were never intended to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Expected rescue operations in the race of finding survivors in Palu, the number of dead ones doubled
The situation becomes increasingly difficult for survivors.
“ There is a lot of excitement in the air, ” said Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, who comforted her sick son in the auxiliary center of Palu.
“ Disease carries all the time body here.
There's little about clean water."
The inhabitants saw return to their devastated homes and searched for their water soss possessions to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were hurt and hospitals are overwhelmed and damaged after the earthquake measured 7.5 points on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke back and axle, were outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were extinct because of persistent forceful posts.
He filled his eyes when he told him how he found the earthquake shake his hotel room in the fifth height, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“ There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed up to the walls, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and said that his family had been in town to go to the wedding.
“ I heard my wife call for help, but then quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe."
The United States Senator is accusing China of "experiences" with "appropriate advertisements"
A week after a public newspaper in China published a four - later advertisement in a U.S. newspaper to discuss the mutual advantages of business between the two countries, the U.S. missionary in China Peking accused of using American media to distribute propaganda.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, last Wednesday talked about the advertising of the Chinese magazine in the Des Moines Register - which is the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China to try to interfere with the Congress elections of the United States on November 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing wanted to interfere with the United States Congress elections marked what official American representatives told Reuters’ newspaper that it was a new point in a growing campaign from Washington to use China’s pressure.
Although it is normal that foreign governments publish advertisements to promote business, Peking and Washington have a continuing business war, with new import prices for both countries.
Chinese and American experts say that early in the business war, Chinese revenge numbers were designed to harm foreigners in Member States such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s reputations.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. missionary of China and the former Iowa State Director for a long time, said that Beijing had damaged American workforces, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad commented in its submission article in Sunday’s Des Moines Register that “China would now increase its persecution by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free media. ”
“ By spreading its propaganda, China’s government is to use the American and our free media’s loved freedom of speech by publishing the cost of advertising in the Des Moines Register, ” said Branstad in its article.
He wrote: “On the other hand, few protestants can be found in newspapers on Peking streets, and no real reflection can be found on the different views that Chinese could have on China’s worrying economic policy, as the media are under the hill of the Chinese Communist Group," he wrote.
He added that “one of the largest newspapers in China came from the command to publish ” his article, but he did not mention what magazine it was.
Experts warn that the reputations are making female voters reluctant to consider them for the mid-term review of the Kavanaugh language.
Experts have warned against negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid-term investigations, because many reputants have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, a appointed Supreme Courter, who has confronted the accusations of sexual prejudice.
Very strong feelings have been around this matter, and most of the reputations have already shown publicly that they wanted to start a vote.
“ These things cannot be backed, ” said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, at The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher doubted that in the last minute of a study by the FBI was calling Jeff Flake, an elder in Arizona, to calm up an angry voter.
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and not November, ” said Karine Jean-Pierre, the supervisor and speaker for the liberal group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang “November approaches! ” when they protested at the course of the Elderly Department when the reputations who ruled the committee decided to continue with the name of Kavanaugh, despite the witness of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“ Interest and an enthusiasm will go out of power, ” said Stu Rothenberg, regardless of politics, to the news page.
“ People will say that interest has already been great, and that is true.
But he could be bigger, especially in women's elections and younger choosers, 18-29 years old, who like the President, but rarely choose."
The articles predicted reproof if the reputations were pressed to confirm Kavanaugh, even for the testimony of Ford, in which she described her accusations of sexual insult from him.
“ This has become a big crawl for the Repumbler class, ” said Michael Still, former member of the Country Committee of the Repumblers, early last week, according to NBC News.
“The matter is not just about the committee’s votes or the final votes, or whether Kavanaugh will be left on the class, but also about how the reputations have handled this and how they have been treated with it, ” said Guy Cecil, president of the Priorities USA, a group who helps to choose democrates, at the news station.
However, the United States seem to disagree with who should believe in the witness from both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a small majority support the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents surely believed the Ford testimony, while 35 percent said that they believed Kavanaugh’s witness, or probably Kavanaugh’s witness.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said that they thought Kavanaugh had probably lied to their witnessing, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the call from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the accusations that Ford put forward and from at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, according to Guardian's report.
Ford witnessed the vow before the election committee last week, saying that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says that Kavanaugh had his sexual abilities in front of her when they were both at a festival as a student at Yale University in the 1990 ’ s.
The man who found the Internet has plans to start a new internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who found the network, is going to set up a sprout company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the last project of the technical decree, is a company based on Solid, an open workplace of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access any information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that the intent behind Inrupt was "the world's authority."
"We have to do this now," he said about the sprout company.
"This is a historical moment."
The program uses Solid technology to make it possible for people to create their own “personal data store on the network” or the POD.
The list of contacts, task lists, calendars, music librarys and other personal and working devices may be included.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
Unusual about the personal data store is that it is completely under the user who can get access to any information.
The company calls it "personal election by using data".
According to John Bruce, the manager of the company, the idea is that Inrupt provides access, process and appropriate knowledge to help make Solid accessible to all.
Now the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security plant purchased by IBM, some programmers who were appointed as a job to work in the project, and a group of programmers in voluntary work.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own independent programs with the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team should not discuss “Facebook and Google about whether to begin a total change that would put their current business message on their head in one night.
“We do not ask them for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published on Saturday on Medium that Inrupt had “a goal of creating energy in business and ecosystems that helped protect the honesty and quality of the new web based on Solid.”
Berners-Lee reconverted the network in 1994 when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an effective voice in the discussion of the neutrality of the network.
Berners-Lee will continue to be founding and head of World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he comes up inruptly.
“I’m full of optimism for the next time of the network,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest and captain of the Victory Cross from World War I Honored
The only English priest to be honored by the Victory Cross during the first world war that soldier has been commended in his hometown 100 years later.
The Specialist Bernard Vann, who was the captain of the army, received the cross on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
On the other hand, four days later he was killed by a secret warrior, and he was never told that he had received the highest honor of the British army.
Two of his grandsons revealed a memorial about him on Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was “fabulous figurative” that the memorial was expelled exactly 100 years from his grandfather’s honor.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vann led his undercover army over the Canal de Saint-Quentin surgery “through a very thick thick thickness and under a hard gun attack from falling guns and machine guns. ”
Later he ran to the shooting line, and with “great courage” he continued the line before he attacked a fall gun one of his armies and overwhelmed three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, only months before the end of the war, a German secret gun was killed.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s heroes were “ something I could never do, but something that makes you humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed the flower crane after the scratch, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was “a great privilege of taking part in the crawling, ” adding that“ the daughters of the true hero are shown with the support so many show. ”
MMA fans awakened all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of seeing Gurra Gris
Just imagine, having awake all night to see the overwhelming Bellator 206, just to be refused to see the main event.
On the agenda were 13 battles from San Jose, six of them at the main record, and they were shown in direct broadcasting all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British audiences got an unexpected appearance when the broadcasting turned into Gurru Gris.
Some were dissatisfied after watching the battle all night.
One admirer on Twitter described the exchanges to the child’s substance as “any kind of sick joke. ”
“ According to official rules, the material was not suitable for the spectators at 6:00 a.m., so they had to change into childhood,” said Dave Schwartz, the manager of the market position and communication to Bellator when he was asked for the broadcast.
“Gurra grey, yes.”
Scott Coker, head of Bellator, said that they would go over their schedules and take the viewers in Britain into account in the future.
“I think that when I think of the show that we could probably get rid of this, ” said Coker.
“ But at 6:00 a.m. on Sunday there, and we can’t get rid of this until Sunday in our day, which is a Monday.
But we're working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, many text messages were sent forward and back, and they were not all kind.
We were trying to fix this, we thought this was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a public problem.
I can promise that this will not happen next time.
We limit the evening at five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and went out of our way.
This is an unhappy condition."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘incapacity’ due to sexuality
The Olympic Deepman Tom Daley claims that he has felt inadequate with other people in his upbringing because of his sexual inclination, but that it encouraged him to succeed.
The 24 - year - old Daley said that he did not realize that “he was different from others” until he went to school for information.
In the Desert Island Discs radio on the Radio 4 channel, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he spoke of the right of homosexuals to give others “hope.”
He also said that the parental activity reduced his interest in the work of the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the usual intermediate director, has taken a few months of vacation because of illness.
Daley was able to exclude in the first part of Laverne and said that he felt he was “mine man” but everyone else when he was a child because“ it was not agreed in the community to love both boys and girls. ”
He said: “To this day, these feelings of feelings have given me the strength and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “either something, ” he said, so that he would not cause any disappointment when finally his sexuality would come up.
The double Olympia Bronze Sea has made a great contribution as supporter of LGBT and has used its participation in the Commonwealth games in Australia to call on more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said that he would hear him because he felt he was lucky to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others “hope. ”
The world champion three times said that it had “come him surprised” to be in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met first in 2013.
Daley married the 20 - year - old Oscar payer, who said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in young age" - but he participated in his first Olympics 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find a peer who had experienced similar success and difficulties.
The couple arranged a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that “all his views of life ” had been forced.
“ If you had asked me last year, everything was about to win a golden prize, ” he said.
“ Know what, there are more important things than the golden prize of the Olympic Games.
Robbie is my Olympia gold award."
His son is baptized in his head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, forty years old, after diagnosing brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not agreed that he would die, and one of the last questions he had asked was if they had already received his notes for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the first row.
“ I couldn’t tell him that he would not live long enough to sit in the first row,” he said.
“ I held my hand on him when he stopped breathing, and it was not until his breath stopped, and he was killed that I finally admitted that he was not victorious, ” he said.
Next year, Daley raced on the Olympics in 2012 and won a bronze salary.
“I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, to deepen me in front of the audiences in the homeland of the Olympic Games. It doesn’t feel better,” he said.
It was also inspired to the choice of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - who had inspired him for the Olympic Games and still gave him a lucky skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
Mickelson in bad shape and left sitting on the class in Ryder's cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will meet on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder's cup, but he needs to find his old tactics again so that it is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the twelve-time race, was put on the class after the chief Jim Furyk’s decision for the races in four bullets and four games on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the hater, as he has been so often before the United States, the day of the fivefold master is divided between a lap manager and practice the plays on the field in the hope of correcting what he is doing.
Mickelson, a 48 - year - old, was never the one who shot directly with the bovines, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National Gulf, where a long glimpse often punishs for bad shots.
And not enough that the golf course is a great challenge in itself, but Mickelson needs to fight Frances Molinari, the winner of British Open, in the nineth game on Sunday. Molinari is with the new Tommy Fleetwood team and together they have worked all four games this week.
If the Americans, which are four points below, take the first game of 12 single games, reach a good start, Micketson’s game could divide the lot.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, but he could hardly say much more.
“ He fully understood the role he had today, knocked on my back, and took me out, saying that he was ready tomorrow, ” said Furyk.
“ He has great self - confidence.
He's in the famous hall, and he's been so much for the past and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more for me, but so this ended, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just as everyone else."
Mickelson will strike Nick Faldo in the number of games played in the Ryder Beker on Sunday.
This could market the end of the process in Ryder, which has never reached exactly as much as other results of his record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 loses, and 7 equals, but Furyk said that his presence had a certain unclean influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's irritable, he's the noble, enjoys making fun of people and it's great to have him in the team room," he explained.
“ I think younger players liked to fight him too this week, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game."
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's leadership knows that a lot of advances may soon disappear
The European past Thomas Bjorn knows from the experience that a good advance for the last day of the individual race in Ryder’s bike can easily change into an unpleasant experience.
The dance first played in Valderrama in 1997, with a five - stage predecessor of the Seven Ballesteros, but it was right to crawl the victory at the end with a minimum possible score, with 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
“The man constantly recalls that we had a lot of advance in Valderrama, we had a lot of advance in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama, where we worked, but just so," said Bjorn, who is here on the picture, after watching 2018 the year's work 5-3 both on Friday and Saturday and reaching the forehead 10-6 on the Le Golf National Vellen.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't done.
We're all going to take place tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not done until all the scores are on the table.
We have our goals, and it's trying to work this cup, we focus on it
I've always said this, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our team, but we're very aware of our countermen in the other team--the best golfers in the world."
Bearn was very pleased with how his players had stood in difficulty, adding: “I’m never going on myself in this.
Morning's gonna be all different.
Tomorrow, the performance of the individuals is important, and that is another thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything works well, but when you play one you're trying on all your talents as a golfer.
It is the message that must be sent to the players, to get the best out of itself tomorrow.
Now a man leaves his partner, and he also needs to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his antitrust Jim Furyk will seek his players to stand better in individual games than with companions, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who worked three of four points.
Furyk has experienced both sides of this great change on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended losing when Europe performed “the miracle of Medinah.”
“ I remember every fucking word, ” he asked how Ben Crenshaw, last 1999, had encouraged his players to continue for the last day.
“ We have to play 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start quickly as did in Brookline and Medinah.
When he gets up, it will cause great pressure on the game that is in the middle.
We arranged our players accordingly and let them play as we think we'll go the best tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the defence and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the game.
“ I chose these players in this order, because I think they are all the way through, ” said Bjorn about their choice of players in the individual race.
The new German army ship is still postponed
The latest German maritime ships should have been built in 2014 to replace an old army ship from the Cold War period, but it will not be ready until the next year because of defective systems and increasing costs, according to news in the area.
The building of “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the leadership of the new army ships by the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the sources of the army spoken to The Time magazine.
The ship had to be taken advantage of the marine army in 2014, but serious problems after delivery of the plague.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered in 2007 should be replaced by the Bremen-class military ships.
They should be equipped with a powerful falling gun, many air-protective and ship-protective planes and hiding techniques, such as reduced radiation-infrared, and sound marks.
Other important qualities are longer time for use - the latest ships should be possible for up to two years from their homes.
However, constantly, these recent military ships - which are said to make it possible for Germany to show their strength on the sea - will be aged when they are finally taken into account, says Die Zeit.
The F125 army came to the news last year when the German army officially refused to accept the ship and returned to the Blohm & Voss release in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the marine army has returned to the manufacturer after delivery.
A little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but the German media talked about many women who were seriously “suppressed in software and machinery” which made the ship useless if they were sent to a warfare.
Software galaxies were particularly important because a Baten-Wuerttemberg army will be managed by 120 men's crew, which is half less than in Bremen's army ships.
It also showed that the ship was too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the capacity of the marine army to improve it in the future.
The 7000 tonnes of "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship is considered to be twice as heavy as a ship in a similar group used by the Germans during the Second World War.
Besides the defects of machinery, the cost of the entire project - including training - is going to cause problems.
It is said that he reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), but it was originally to be 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest ships are particularly important in the light of the warning that the superiority of Germans on the outside is reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Congress Defense Committee, admitted that the marine army was actually being “superior bodies with an operational ship.”
The representative said that the problem had arisen over time, for older ships were taken off of use but no ships came to their place.
He regretted that none of the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be taken into use by the marine army.
National Trust Natural Protection Organization Spying on the Secret Life of Leather Blows
A new study conducted in the countryside of the Russian Highlands aims to find out how leather bubbles use the landscape when they fish for food.
It is hoped that the results will give new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and will help to guide the future natural protection measures.
The research conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will monitor various types of leather blades in the Inverewe gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be installed in key locations across the area to monitor the behaviour of the leather blades over the period.
NHS and volunteers will also be monitored with handheld sensors.
Experts will identify all recordings to determine the frequency of the calls given by the leather blades, and what types are doing.
The map of locals and reports will then be published to create a precise picture of their geographical behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS NTS peculiar adviser, hopes that the results will reveal what kind of living area is most important for the leather blades and how they are used of each type.
This information will help to determine the potential for the management of residential areas, e.g. by creating noise and how to maintain forest areas for leather blades and other related species.
In the last century, leather bubbles have decreased significantly in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom.
They are at risk because of construction and development projects that affect their crops and reduce their habitats.
Windmills and lights can also cause risks, including flight papers, and certain components of building materials, as well as domestic attacks.
In fact, leather bubbles are not blind.
However, their ears are far more beneficial than their eyes when they catch a bitch, because they are used to hunt in the night.
They use high - advanced mining techniques to find insects and items on their flight route.
NTS, responsible for maintaining over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land, takes leather blades very seriously.
In the organizations, ten experts regularly carry out tests, crop views, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organizations have even launched the first and one country of lords of Scotland at the Threave farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of ten types of leather bubbles of Scotland have their homes.
David Thompson, overseer of the farm, says he is a perfect area for them.
"The area here at Threave is great for leather bubbles," he said.
“ We have old buildings, plenty of grown trees, and plenty of good habitats.
But there's still a lot of unconscious of leather bubbles, so the work we work here and elsewhere will help us to understand more what they need to do."
He emphasized the importance of checking with leather blades prior to maintenance at homes, as possible unwilling destruction on one crop can kill up to 400 female leather blades and young people and destroy all the leather blades in the area.
Leather blades are protected, and they are not killed, struck or disrupted, or destroyed.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about leather blades, and we don’t know how well many of their species are going. ”
Ronaldo rejects the accusations of rape when lawyers prepare a law against German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called accusations against him about the rape of “false news” and says that people want to ‘reach attention’ by using his name.
His lawyers are planning to seek the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The army for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping a U.S. woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $37,000 afterwards for a shame of the event, according to the newspaper Der Spiegel on Friday.
A few hours after the release of the accusations, Ronaldo, 33 years old, said in Instagram Live video to 142 million of his followers that they were “false news. ”
“No, no, no, no, no, no.
What was said today is false news," said the world champion five times to the camera.
“ These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it is part of the work.
I am a happy man and everything is in good," added the player to smile.
According to Reuter’s newspaper, lawyers Ronaldos are preparing for the application of Der Spiegel because of the accusations they have called “unacceptable publication of a suspect of private life. ”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that Ronaldo would require compensation for “the same amount as the severity of the fraction, which is probably one of the most serious breaches of personal rights in recent years. ”
The indicted event has occurred in June 2009 in the Palms hotel and the Las Vegas casino.
After meeting a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the room of the player, where he should have raped her in the end-arm, according to documents that were ordered for the province of Clark County in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell on a knee after the event and told her that he was “99 percent of a good man” who fell in temptation because of“ 1 percent. ”
The documents argue that Ronaldo agreed that the couple had sex but that they had both agreed.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and had taken pictures of her actions in a hospital, but finally agreed outside the courtroom because she was “favored of revenge ” and worried about being“ deprived in public. ”
She now says she wants to stop the covenant because she's still in shock after a bad event.
Ronaldo was near to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape had to take place, and in summer he went over to the Italian giant Juve with a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: United Kingdom would “see for ever” to lose car manufacturers
Bretland would “see forever” if it lost its position as a international leader among car manufacturers by Brexit, says Greg Clark of business.
He added that Toyota UK had told BBC that if Britain left the European Union without a contract, the company would discontinue the temporary production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automobile manufacturer said that if Brexit without agreement, the effect from delay at the border would cost work.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, produced almost 150,000 cars in the past, of which 90% were transferred to other European countries.
“My view is that if Britain falls out of the EU by the end of March, we will see the production apparatus in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota Executive Director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about EU exits without consent, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that he will close his Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns arise from what automobile manufacturers say are a risk of captivity if Brexit becomes a reality without agreement.
Toyota’s production line is based on a “last hour” reception, where parts are delivered every 37 minutes from both British and EU stocks for cars manufactured after ordering.
If Britain withdraws from the European Union without agreement on 29 March, it could be disrupted at the borders that the industry considers could lead to a shortage and shortage of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day stock in its factory in Derbyshire, said the company, and therefore the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that the Theresu May Chequers programme for future relations with the European Union “was especially aimed at preventing these views at the borders.”
“We have to have an agreement. We want to get the best deal that enables us not only to enjoy success in modern times, but as an opportunity we can use," he said in a radio section at BBC Radio 4.
“ The research data, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, show that we need to continue with very successful approaches.
Toyota was unable to tell how long their production would stop, but warned that the increased cost would reduce the competitive capacity of the factory and eventually cost the work.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a credible trade union in the factory, said that his companions were increasingly worried: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they will never return.
The President of the Government said: “We have presented a precise and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU. ”
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
Thus, on Sunday the White House declared that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, the advocate of the State of Assistance, could be “released for one week” now the dispute for Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Judge, continues.
Rosenstein supervises the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, who investigates Russian practices in the elections, associations between the auxiliaries of Trump and Russia, and possible obstacles to the progress of the President’s justice.
For many weeks, history has gone in Washington about whether Trump will expel a auxiliary attorney, thus putting Mueller’s independence in danger.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed having a recording device to interact with Trump and the possibility of considering the president by using the 25th additional section of the control file.
Rosenstein refused that claim.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House, including the hearing that he was going to say.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, when he was with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said, "very not" wants to run Rosenstein, but then the meeting was suspended so that he was not at the same time as the hearing of the Elderly Division’s Judge Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who have accused him for sexual action, had both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly study of the FBI on the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the voting fee of the elders.
Sarah Sander, a media officer of Trumps, was in a post at Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date for him has not been determined, it could be this week, and I think he may be postponed for another week because of all other things that are going on at the Supreme Court.
But we see, and I'm always happy to inform the media."
Some newspapers disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a newspaper meeting in the White House since September 10th.
For that reason, the commander Chris Wallace asked.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not uncomfortable because television newspapers had “visual humanity, ” but she said:“ I do not disagree with the fact that they have visual humanity. ”
She then gave evidence that a direct relationship between Trumps and the media would increase.
“ The president answers more questions to the media than any other president has done before, ” she said, without referring to the statement: “We have crossed these numbers. ”
But “if media have the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of it, and you've seen us do a lot of the last few weeks, and it'll replace media meetings when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
There are rare media meetings with him alone.
This week, the president may have shown this reason in New York, when he proved obscure, and in times of strange conduct in front of a group of newspapers.
Health Minister writes EU healthcare professionals in Scotland due to Brexit’s concern
The health minister has written an EU staff working within the health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) to express the people’s gratitude and wish that they continue to work after Brexit has passed through.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter as soon as within six months until Britain leaves the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already promised to meet the costs due to the application of employment for EU citizens working within the public service providers.
Miss Freeman wrote in his letter: “During the summer, discussions between the United Kingdom and the European Union have continued because of the statements and are expected to be decided in the afternoon.
The British Government has also worked to prepare, if possible, for a contract.
I know this must be a lot of uncertainty for you all.
Therefore, I would like to say again how much I appreciate the work of all the employees, regardless of their nationality.
Social partners from the EU and around the world come with precious experience and knowledge that strengthens and improves health services and improves the benefit of the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is indeed your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after having suffered headaches
Christion Abercrombie, liner for Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after having suffered headaches in 31-27 losses against the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, according to a report by Mike Organ, tennessean journalist.
Rod Reed, overseer Tennessee State, told newspapers that the pain had become shortly before halfgame.
"He came to the side line and fell down there," said Reed.
Coachs and nurses gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before he was put on a bar and drilled off for a closer view.
Agent of Tennessee State told Chris Harris, WSMV radioman in Nashville, Tennesse, that Abercrombie had been in surgery at Vanderbilt hospital.
Harris added that there were “no information on the type or severity of impact yet” and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in a final school year, plays his first time with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five gears all over on Saturday before he left, which increased the total number of tricks with him up to 18.
Foreign purchasers will be charged with higher sums when buying real estate in Britain
Agricultural buyers will be charged with higher sums when buying property in Britain.
The operation will make no success of Corbyn's campaign to draw to young voters
Increased timber payments will be charged to those who do not pay tax in Britain
The Kingdom Fund estimates to generate $120 million a year - to help homeless people.
Foreign purchasers will be charged with higher sums when buying real estate in Britain. The excess money will be used to help homeless people. Theresa May will report this today.
The operation will be considered to be an attempt to make no success of Jeremy Corbyn’s military trips to attract young voters by commending homes to more affordable prizes and further taxing high-cost people.
Individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom need to pay higher sums, and the excess sales will take place in the government's actions to help homeless people.
The increase - which is additional to the current plunger fee, including the increase that was applied two years ago in an extra home and a rental property - could be up to three percent.
The Kingdom Fund estimates that the increase will generate up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of London’s new buildings are purchased by foreigners, which leads to price increases and makes those who want to buy property more difficult for the first time to enter the market.
Many important areas in the country - especially in the capital city - have become "the dwellings" because of a number of foreign buyers who spend their most time in a foreign country.
The new way comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called after a reduction in the number of plungers to help other young people get their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping the real estate price high by buying a land area but not using it, and urged May to cease the demands of homes on the premises to adjust the “home-room doses” of the UK.
Mr. Corbyn has reported a number of insighted reimbursements in home affairs, including leases and the end of the rent houses.
He also wants to give more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “First I said I would sanctify the restoration of the British dream during my first period — that every new generation should enjoy better quality of life.
And that involves adjusting our unnecessary real estate market.
The doors of the UK will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be true that it is as easy for foreigners as for businesses with foreign headquarters to buy homes and hardly British nationals.
For many is the dream of their own house far too far away, and the shame of homelessness is still too real."
Jack Ross: “My main goal is to train Scotland”
Jack Ross, trainer Sunderland, says that it is his “most goal” to become a scholar of Scotland at some time.
This 42-year-old Shoot now enjoys the challenge to blow new lives in the North-East club, which is now sitting in the third seat of the first section, three stages from the top.
He moved to Sunderland in the summer after he returned to the Scottish Autumn Division during the last stage.
“ I wanted to play for my people as a player.
I was hurt at the knee, so it was done," said Ross in an interview with the Sports Sound at BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and there is always something that has taken me back.
But that would only be a chance if I did well to train the department."
The predecessors of Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former trainer of the Alloa Athletic Club said that he didn't feel any fear of following in the footsteps so famous names by such a large club, but he had previously rejected training positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“ Like what, I will measure my success by thinking: “Can I bring this club back to the superior department? ”
This club has no doubt at home in the election department because of his construction and position," he said.
“ It’s not a easy job to get him there, but I would probably only view myself as a success here if I came back to the club. ”
Ross has only three years of experience, as a trainer, after a period of assistance as a coach in Dumbarton and 15 months as part of Heart’s training team.
He helped Alloa to cope with the falling down to the third division, and he changed St Mirren, who was falling about the department, to the next playtime of the department champion.
Ross says he's more self-safe now than he ever was at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“ This was probably a real timing, ” he says about the period when he became a trainer of Alloa.
“ I really believed that the training work was suitable for me, even more than playing.
It sounds astonishing, for I walked well, I had a decent income of it, and enjoyed good success.
However, changes can be difficult.
You have to go through many things every week.
I’m still going through stress and pressure from my work, but the training work seems just right for me.
I always wanted to train, and now I do, I have never felt better with myself in all my adult years."
It is possible to listen to all the interviews in the Sports Sound section on Sunday, September 30 in Radio Scotland between 12 and 13.00 at the British location time.
The best time for beer is at 7:30 a.m. on Saturdays, according to a survey
In summer, the heating has proved delicate for British bars in bass, but the pressure on restaurant cakes has increased.
The sale in monkeys and bars increased by 2.7% in July, but the sale in restaurants decreased by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from CGA’s business consultant, who collected the figures, said: “The advanced sunshine and the unexpected success of England’s world beaker meant that July followed a pattern similar to June, when the bars increased by 2.8 percent, except what restaurants sold even less.
The sale fell by 1.8 percent at restaurants in June, and it rose again in July.
Pöbbars and bars, mostly on drinking, were most of the best while restaurants went down.
Pöbbars who sold food were also difficult in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out to drink.
The sale of drinks in monkeys and bars increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, but the sale of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, a RSM analysis company, said: “These results are continuing in the fluctuation that we have seen since April.
The weather and effects of important social events or sports events are still the biggest factors in sales from outside home markets.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups still have difficulty, although sales reductions of 4.8 per cent per month are particularly painful above the continuing pressure caused by costs.
This long and hot summer could hardly get a worse time for measuring, and only the time will reveal whether temperature temperatures, as we've had in August, will improve the situation."
Total sales growth in puppies and restaurants, including newly opened sites, was 2.7% in July, which reflects how possible to open.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the surveillance company with a sale in the British pan-bar and restaurant store, collects and analyses data from 47 business groups, with a total of 9 billion pounds and is the industrial scheme for the radiator.
One out of five children has a secret account of social media that they hide from their parents
One out of five children, up to 11 years old, have secret accounts of social media that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to the results of an investigation.
A study of 20,000 students showed an increase in “insta” pages
News have increased anxiety about the publication of sexual material
Twenty percent of students claim that they have a "total" account that they show parents
One out of five children, up to 11 years old, make secret accounts for social media that they keep secret to adults.
A study of 20,000 students showed a significant increase in “smoke Insta” accounts - which is referenced to the Instagram website.
The news has increased anxiety about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of the students said that they had a pure “total” account to show parents, as well as to have secret accounts.
One mother, who fell down to his 13 - year - old daughter’s secret website, found a teenager who encouraged others to “exhaust me. ”
The study made by Digital Awareness UK and the Senior College Manager (HMC) showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 years had two accounts and half of them admitted to have secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chief HMC, said: “It is anxiety that so many youths are tempted to create an area on the network where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "Radio of Sports" in the Scottish Sports Committee
Eilidh Doyle has been elected at the Scottish Athletics Committee as director without executive authority at the annual General Assembly of the Government.
Doyle, Scotland’s most successful liberalist woman, and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said that the appointment was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her great experience in the world field of the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect within sports communities in Scotland, Britain and internationally, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from getting it into the committee," said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking in the hand of athletes and I hope that I can work out and help to continue sporting in Scotland. ”
The U.S., who worked among the 200 metres and 400 metres of the Olympic Games in Atlanta 1996, with a total of four Olympic Gold, which is now a regular visitor of BBC, was paralyzed after having received a transient haemorrhage.
He wrote on Twitter: “For one month, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Physicians said that only time would reveal whether I was balanced and how much.
This has been a difficult job, but I was fully balanced, learned to walk again and to do sports training today!
Thank you for your words of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertisement, comparable to cows, causes Internet conflict
Companies producing breast pumps are now communicated on the Internet due to an advertisement of lactating mothers with lactating cows.
The company Elvie published a useful advertisement to mark a presentation of what is said to be “the first silent breast pump of the world that can be carried out outside”. The advertisement is inspired by musical videos and should show the freedom that the new pump provides mothers who are breast-feeding.
Four real mothers dance in a hole full of hip, and we crown a song with a text like: “Yes, I milk me, but you see no throat on me” and “If you don’t notice it, these are not oaks, but my breasts.”
The relief continues: “Pumping, pumping, feeding the children, pumping, pumping, pumping milk from the yolks. ”
However, the advertisement, which appears on the Facebook page of the company, has resulted in an online call.
The video has 77,000 views and hundreds of advertisements and has been given different reactions from the audiences, which many say that it was guilty of the “hrylling” that was associated with the lactating industry.
“ It’s really a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
As we do, they need to be calves, and bears to produce milk, except what the calfs are taken from them only a few days after they are born," said in one note.
The Elvie breast pump fits conveniently in the breast-feeder (Elvie/Mother)
Another audience wrote: “It is hard for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who may keep their children?"
Another added: “This advertisement is totally out of line with time. ”
Others came to defend the ad, and one woman acknowledged that her part was “the funny. ”
“ I think this is a great idea.
I would've bought this if I still had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as she is.
This is a genius," wrote one of the audiences.
Another said: “This is a fun advertisement that is directed to mothers who pump milk (often at work or inside the toilet) and feels like “come. ”
This is not an advertisement that commends or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the advertisement, the female group shows that they were all dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their breast-feeders.
The idea behind the advertising campaign is that many women say that they feel like cows when pumping out milk.
However, the Elvie pump is quite silent, has no winds or directions, and fits comfortablely in a breast-feeder, which gives women freedom to move, hold their child, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, the co-owner and supervisor of Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is so revolutionary that she deserved an outstanding presentation that would raise a number.
By comparing women we cows, we wanted to direct the lamp to breast pumping and all its challenges, even in an amusing and familiar way how much freedom the new pump would give.
This isn't the first time that the Elvie pump has come to the news.
During the fashion week in London, a two - children - mother showed a fashion show for the designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrants quietly moved to tabernacles near the border of Texas
The number of immigrants in the guard has suddenly increased even though the number of people crossing the borders of each month has remained the same, and the reason is that harsh speech and directions made by the government of Trump have made it more difficult to bring their children into a temporary fetus.
Usually, the foetal parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves and have feared to put their potential to remain in danger in the country by offering themselves to a child’s birth.
The risk increased in June, when the public authorities announced that possible foetal parents and other adults in the home would have to make fingerprints, and that the data would be divided by the immigrant surveillance.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the leader of the immigrants and customs authorities, witnessed before the elders and said that his institution had arrested a number of people who were seeking to foster single children.
The foundation later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not in charge.
“ Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foetal parents or homes in a child’s home are illegal in the country, and much of them are illegal immigrants in the criminal register.
"Therefore we keep looking for their individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up children’s affairs, representatives reported new rules that require some of the children to be attended to court within a month of their postponement, rather than after 60 days of the previous term, according to staff working in the action.
Many of them will come through videos, rather than in their own, to make evidence of their legal position before judges in immigrant matters.
The children who are judged inadequate to enter the country are sent out of the country soon.
The longer children are in guard, the more likely they are to become anxiety or depression, which may lead to violence or the attempt to escape, according to the local staff and reports published by the system in recent months.
Talents said that these problems were even more likely to be in a larger institution, such as in Tornillo, since no one is aware of the difficultness of a child because of how many they are.
They added that the transfer of the children to the tent city without giving enough time to prepare them spiritually or to say goodbye friends could increase the shock many of them already face.
Syria urges the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Walid al-Moualem, Minister for Foreign Affairs, also said in his speech at the STH General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in their eighth year.
Moualem, who also plays the role of the Prime Minister of Resurrection, said that the foreign army was illegal in Syria, under the false presumption that they were fighting terrorism, and that “they will be handled in harmony with it. ”
“ They must draw back immediately and without any conditions, ” he said to the council.
So Moualem firmly stated that “the war against terrorism was almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue “to carry out this sacred battle until we cleanse all Syrian territories“ from both terrorist groups and “all illegal foreigners. ”
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, where most of them train and advise both the Kurdish armies and Syrian Arøbs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 armies in this war - struggle country.
In the case of refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances were good enough for them to return and he taught "some Western countries" to "proliferate unreasonable fear" which encouraged refugees to stay away.
“ We have called on a international community and humanitarian organization to facilitate their return, ” he said.
“They make politics from something that should be merely human beings.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funds for reconstruction in Syria unless a political agreement exists between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a neutral area at the last major defense of the opponent has created the opportunity to continue political conversations.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a huge attack from Syrian armies strengthened by Russia, in the region where three million people live.
On the other hand, Moualem stressed that the contract had a “a distinctive final asset” and described the hope that military operations would be directed to the Jihadists, including the Nusra Front warriors, who are connected with Al-Qaeda, and that they would be “speaked out.”
Staffan de Mistura, Senator SD, hopes to be able to meet the first meetings with a new committee consisting of the members of the government and the opposition, to make an Syrian regime after the war and pay the street for the elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the involvement of the Syrian Government in the Committee and stated that its activities should be limited to “passing over the provisions of the current government” and warned against all interventions.
The reason that Trump will win another election period
According to that argument, Mr. Trump would perform the re-elections in 2020, except the accusations and aggressions of his presidential powers, as many freely viewers probably hope.
In what would undoubtedly be “the dramatic end of the presidential force ever! ”
As it is, the audiences have no tiredness.
Since 2014, views at the best time have doubled up to 1.05 million in CNN, and almost threefolded to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million audiences at the best time, which is an increase from 1.7 million audiences four years ago, according to Nielsen, and a part of MSNBC, The Rachel Maddow Show, has raised a view of up to 3.5 million audiences in important news evenings.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the participant ABC dramatical theme “Designated Survivor” about a member of the government who becomes president after the presidency is destroyed.
Nell Scovell, experienced joke writer and writer of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another view.
She remembers a trip to a taxi in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to choose Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he makes me laugh," said Miss Scovell to me.
It's the entertainment value in the arrogance.
However, unlike what is shown on television, the history of Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can unite and the health of the international economy.
Only the audiences who enjoy the greatest privileges will be able to stop watching.
And yet, it is more than to be an informed citizen when you look at the sixth time on a group of experts using Bob Woodwards on “aver near” sources for his book “Fear” or $15,000 jacket from a bush that Paul Manafort was dressed (“alike that is feeded with pride,” said Washington Post) and the consequences of the exact biological descriptions of Stormy Daniels on Mr. Trump.
At least I'll never see Super Mario the same eyes again.
“On the part of what he does, you feel that this is like a realistic factor, that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the “Pawn Stars”, when he discussed the worker's selection in the show of Trumps and daily changes in the history thread (e.g. to start a match with N.F.L. and commend to Kim Jong-Un).
You can't miss one factor, or you'll lose your thread.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, there was 26 degrees of temperature and sunshine outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he stayed inside and watched MSNB while he took up CNN.
He could not throw himself away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to testify before the Judgment Committee of the Elderly Division, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember when we were creating all these crazy factors in ancient times, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr Fleiss to me.
“ I thought this was a joke, but it was evident that people were right. ”

Money in the mid-term elections outside the flow
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th election will see the money flowing, thanks to the reorganization of the elections that led to two representatives of the same seat.
The newly organized Pittsburg region sends the Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a different area in special elections last summer.
Lamb offers himself to other representatives, the reputant Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is very close to the new 17th area.
The maps of decentralized areas were reorganized after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old fields were organized in the interests of the reputations and that they breached the regime.
The new 17th cycle has been initiated by a competition in the financing of election campaigns between the main financial operators of both categories, the Democratic Core Committee (DCCC) and the Decimal Committee of Repumbles (NRCC).
Lamb became a well - known name in Pennsylvania after a short victory of special elections in March before the 18th main area of Pennsylvania, many of them followed.
The reputations had previously warmed it for more than decades, and Donald Trump, President, was victorious in the field of 20 degrees.
Political experts have given democratics some presumption.
The United States intended to punish El Salvador for support from China, but then ceased.
Kingdom Indians noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with little oppositions from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President Panama in June 2017, and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the members of the Trump composer’s management team took away.
Representatives of the Foreign Ministry decided to call back the U.S. ambassador in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, because of “a new decision not to admit the Cheven anymore, ” said Heather Nauert, the spoken minister in the announcement early this month.
However, penalties were considered solely against El Salvador, estimated to have received 140 million dollars from the United States for assistance in 2017, including drug surveillance, development, and economic support.
The penalties that were imposed and included, inter alia, a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the release of residence permits, would have been painful for the Mediterranean country, where there is a high rate of unemployment and murder.
Following the continuation of interior meetings, American and Central American representatives postponed a security and economic success conference and were to follow a similar meeting that was held in the past and considered to be a step forward in actions to prevent people from moving to the United States.
In the mid - September, however, representatives from the upper series made clear that they wanted the conference to be made, resulting in the end of all conflicts about punishment against El Salvador.
President-in-Office Mike Pence is now referring to the conference to take place in the middle of October, as a sign of how important it is in the eyes of the government, the events said.
The three U.S. missionaries also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new hard message or punishment from Washington.
The White House spoke for Mr. Bolton refused to discuss the discussions of the three American representatives, including two ambassadors, who agreed to discuss the interior arguments against being unnamed.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outsider who works closely with the government and also talked about the issue of unnamedness.
Learning the History
The next offense may be the report of Robert Mueller, a special accuser, on possible action by Mr Trump to prevent justice, but there is a lot of public evidence for that accusation.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller also turned on whether Mr. Trumps' election campaign worked with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If the meeting is managed by another group, Trump may need to be responsible for it, in the time he prepares to meet his voters again, and perhaps the abdomen ordered his equals.
However, this is very uncertain, and I do not want to say that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor does his colleague in Europe fall.
We all have to choose, both on the side of the Atlantic, which will affect the length of the fight.
In 1938, German ministers were ready to rob Hitler’s power, only if western countries had given him opposition and supported the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the afternoon years of disaster.
The history is about such important points and speeds, or delays, for the infinite progress of democracy.
The Americans are faced with some of these important points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump runs Rod Rosenstein, the man who deals with Mr. Mueller's destiny?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this magazine reported that in the past he had proposed to make secret records of the president, discussing whether he was incapable of office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the news of the Times is not right.
“ How will we react if the newly requested study of the FBI at Brett Kavanaugh is not detailed or reasonable, or if it is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual insult and unhonest witness?
And above all, will we choose a meeting in the mid-term which will make Mr. Trump responsible?
If we do these tests, the democracy will need to be tired for a long winter.
But I think we will not fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish man from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and was previously sitting in my ambassador’s house.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to fire on the Sabbath lights on the table with the crown cross.
With such an inheritance, how can I not look positively at our future?"

Graham Dorrans, Sergeant Rangers, optimism for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory against the Austrians will bring them into a strong position to get out of the G Group of the European Union.
Measurement on the knee prevented Graham Dorrans from playing his first game in the playtime before in the game against Villareal, which ended with a 2-2 consecutive, but he believes that Rangers can use the result of a jumper to improve its success.
“ It was good to get this point for us, for the Wizard is a strong team, ” said Dorran, 31 years old.
“ We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and end up taking one step.
Perhaps we could have claimed a victory at the end, but in the whole, there was probably a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half game, and we came strongly into the second half game and played better.
Thursday is another important evening for the European Department.
Hopefully we can reach three points, but it will be a difficult game because they went well in their last game, but with the audiences that support us, I'm sure we're going to endure this and have a positive outcome.
The last year was difficult, both because of my hurt and the changes that occurred in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling in the place.
The team is good and the boys enjoy themselves, the training is good.
I hope we can move further now, put the last time behind us, and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing salary savings
Although participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to care for them, few were discussing it with their family members.
About half of the individuals in the National Surveillance said that they talked to their mate about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said that they were talking to their children.
“The people want a family member to take care of it, but it does not take the right steps to have their conversations,” said Holly Snyder, head of the National Security Department.
That's how it starts.
Talk to your mate and your children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes clear with good warning.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you get care, for these options can change much about cost.
Get your financial counselor in the case: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life assurance with long-term care, mixed life assurance that pays for money, to help pay costs, or self-security with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal disputes in advance.
Get a responsible person for your healthcare so that you can name someone you trust to supervise your healthcare and ensure that healthcare professionals are in your requests if you cannot tell them directly yourself.
Also, consider getting a procuracy for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure that your accounts are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in an emergency and is on the way to a hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Give the information accurately in the written schedule so that you are ready.
“ It’s not only about the finances, but also about who the doctors are, ” said Martin.
“ What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep those plans ready."
A man shot several times with a gun in Ilfracombe
A man was often shot with a air gun when he was on his way home footing after having been out of the street.

Earthquakes and Flood waves in Indonesia
At least 384 were killed after a powerful earthquake and a flood wave in the Indian city of Pala on Friday, representatives said, and the number of dead will increase.
Since all communications are down, auxiliary workers have not been able to provide any information from the state of Donggala, a northern Palu area, near the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 in Richter.
More than 16,000 people were left their homes in Pala after the calamity was over.

Attorneys are pursuing a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist attacker in New York City
New York Attorneys want to have a death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected to have participated in a terrorist attack in New York City, which became eight of a man’s death.
Saipov, 30 years old, is considered to have taken a Home Depot truck on a rental to attack people on a wheelchair along the street West Side Highway in the lower part of Manhattan.
In order to justify the death penalty, the defendants must prove that Saipov killed the victims eight “willingly” and causes serious physical injury “willingly”, according to the willing statement of the application of death penalty recorded in the Southern Territory of New York.
Both of these accusations can lead to possible death penalties, according to the legal document.
Many weeks after the attack, Saipov prosecuted in 22 teams, including eight accusations of murder for a criminal purpose, usually used by accusations against organised crimes, and Saipov was also accused of violent crime and the destruction of the car.
The attack included a “number of plans, ” prosecutors said and described Sapiov’s actions as“ horrible, cruel, and immoral. ”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was caused by physical injuries, damage and loss for families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," says the willing statement.
Five victims were travelers from Argentina.
It has been decades since Southern New York, for the last time, a death trial was undertaken.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was accused of killing two drug dealers but was finally sentenced in a lifetime prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a court case in New York in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, couples who were executed after being accused of experiencing spying for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both couples were extinct in the electric chair.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no evidence of repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told an investigator that he was well aware of what he had done, said the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he had received the idea of the attack after watching videos from the ISIS in his phone, according to what was said in the charge.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He has declared his innocentness in all 22 teams of charge.
David Patton, one of the official defendants of Saipov, said that they were “of course disappointed” by the decision of the charge.
“We believe that the decision to ask for a death penalty instead of accepting a debtary declaration against a lifetime prison without the possibility of a loss of experience will only extend the shock due to this event for all the participants,” said Patton.
Saipov's defendants had previously asked the defendant not to seek death penalty.
The Senator of the Maintenance Group says that NIGEL FARAGE should conduct contractual negotiations for Brexit.
Nigel Farage promised to ‘activate the army of the people’ today at the protests of the Consultative Conference.
This former leader, Ukip, said that politicians would have to ‘find pressure’ from doubters about the EU at the same time as one of the Congressers Theresu May suggested that he should conduct the negotiations with the EU.
Mr. Peter Bone said to the Birmingham protester that if Mr. Farage was the leader of Brexit, the UK had been “out” today.
However, the challenge that May faces in dealing with a deep conflict between her own officers was even more evident when maintainers who want to remain in the EU participated in other protests against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is in difficulty keeping his Chequers plan on the right path and is criticized by those who are opposed to Brexit, those who are opposed, and the EU.
The United States claimed that she will continue to struggle to reach agreement with Brussels, despite opposition and force those who are opposed to Brexit and the Workers Group to choose between her plans and “incredence. ”
Mr. Bone said to the Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull that he wanted to “dissolve the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should have taken part in the negotiations with Brussels.
“ If he were with the government, we would have gone out now, ” he said.
The Senator of Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.”
He explained his opposition to the EU, saying: “We do not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone pointed out that the opinion of the public had changed from the 2016 elections: “The idea that the British public has changed its views and wants to stay is totally untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a maintaining supporter of Brexit, also in the protest, said to newspapers: “I simply want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unfamiliar among the public, and the opposition will not choose with it, and it will enjoy an inconvenience among our classes and the operators who are on the streets and choose us.
Please, quit the Chequers plan and you started listening."
In direct messages to May, she added: “Presidents keep their work when they fulfill their promises. ”
Mr Farage said that the politicians would have to “find pressure” if they were to deprive of the decision taken following the vote in 2016.
“ This is about trust between our people and our political group, ” he said.
“ They want to try to betray Brexit and we are here today to say to them, “We will not let you get up with this.”
He added in his message to the crowds: “I want you to let your political group, who is being disillusioned from Brexit, feel pressure.
We operate the general army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-controlling, proud Great Britain."
At the same time, EU supporters held protests in Birmingham, which concluded a two - time Protestant meeting in the city.
A small group of operators woven the captives against Brexit after the group was set up during the weekend.
Lord Adonis, of the Working Party, laughed on the maintainers because of security problems that occurred in the group’s phone program when the conference was opened.
“This is the people who tell us that they can have all the computer systems all right and all technology for Canada plus, for borders without barriers, for free business with Ireland without borders," he added.
“ This is a total distress.
There is nothing that can be called good Brexit," he said.
Warren intends to “think seriously” to offer himself to the Presidential Office.
Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Senior Assembly, said that after the elections in November, the presidential office will be “invited to consider seriously. ”
In a report from Boston Globe, the Democrat of Massachusetts discussed his future at a civil meeting in the western part of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has unusually criticized President Donald Trump, offers a re-course in November against the reputation of Geoff Diehl, who was a co-general of the Trumps elections in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been the central point of idolatry that it could offer herself against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke afternoon was a 36th meeting in the form of a civil meeting with its inhabitants, since Trump took office.
One attendee at the meeting asked her if she was planning to offer herself to the president.
Warren answered that it was time for women to “go to Washington and arrange our government, and then also a woman as a leader is needed. ”

On Saturday, the police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced that she had arrested one suspect in the case of the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge reported the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old at the news meeting at 11 a.m.
She had previously published a video of the shooting attack on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who was seen on the recording.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot to death near the University of Southern University early on Friday.
“Wayde Sims got a shot in his head and died because of it,” said Murphy J. Paul, policeman, at the media on Saturday, according to a 247 - sports report.

Grand Prix, Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the seat after order from their team.
It was clear from the fact that the Valtteri of Bottas had a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton before launching on Saturday, that orders from the team of Mercedes would play a great part in the race.
Bottas got a good start in the booth, and Hamilton almost left his position in the first two curves and invited Vettel to fight his companion.
Vettel first went to the mine and let Hamilton drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been able to take decisions.
The Mercedes car went into the mine one ring later, and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came out after a narrow struggle where the driver Ferrari was forced to leave behind the inside side after having been at risk to be left, after the defense attempts in the third wing.
Max Verstappen began at the end of the first ring, on his 21 - year - old birthday, at the seventh place.
He then led the majority of the race when he delayed changing ceilings to try to finish quickly and get out of Kimi Raikkonen and reach the fourth seat.
He finally went to the mine in the 44th ring, but could not increase the speed of the eight remaining rings, and Raikkonen took the fourth seat.
This is a difficult day, for Valtteri was a beautiful one throughout the weekend and was a true gentleman to let me go.
The team has been great to achieve this success," said Hamilton.
It was really bad physical constipation.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, laughed at a meeting on Saturday by Senior Departement Dianne Feinstein, because of her claim that she had not read the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, with a charge against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Judge, about sexual action.
The president spoke at a meeting in Western Virginia, but did not directly discuss the Ford testimony for the election committee; instead, he said that what was happening at the Elderly Division meeting showed that people were “guilty and cruel and unreasonable.”
“ The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has been in progress in the last days of the elders, when one sees the anger, when one sees people who are angry and evil and cruel and unfaithful, ” he said.
“ When you see the publications and the leaks and then they say, “Oh, I did not.
I didn't."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do this?
Remember her reply... you will find the document - “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I don't laugh it."
Wait a minute.
Let's finish... no, we're not laughing,” he said and imitate the Senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where the accusations from Ford against Kavanaugh appeared, and then the leaking was early in September, and Feinstein refused that the leak had come from her office.
"I didn't hide the charges of Dr. Ford, I didn't laugh her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to the report from The Hill.
“ She asked me to keep it in confidence, and I did as she asked me. ”
But her rejection seemed not to go well up to the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I will tell you that, this was really a bad condition.
Maybe she wasn't laughing, but this was the worst fiction I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of three women’s sexual struggle, and claimed that democrats were using their accusations for their benefit.
“ They are determined to re-elect, regardless of the methods to be used.
You see the cruelness, the wicked, who cares who they hurt, who they have to rule over to reach power and government," said the president, according to a news from the Mediaite.

A flight manager makes life to ensure that hundreds of passengers in a plane escape earthquake
A flight manager in Indonesia has been decorated as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane with hundreds of passengers could take the air whole and the shelter.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missed after a large earthquake rage over the island of Sulawes on Friday, and then a flood wave began.
Large afterlifes continue to crush the area, and many are trapped under ruins in the city of Palu.
The 21 - year old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his companions had fled the tower of control that was swallowing extremely at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He was staying to ensure that the Batik Air plane number 6321, which was on the airport, when the earthquake was over, could certainly get to the air.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
He died in a hospital later.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to a report from ABC News, Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Calimantan, to move him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are very sad to hear this," he added.
The authorities fear speaking the dead may exceed a thousand, as the country’s disaster agency says that access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
“ The number of dead is still increasing because many bodies are still ruined and cannot be reached, ” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Agency.
Up to six feet [6 m] of high waves have caused an enormous destruction in Pala, where a plenty of funeral will be held on Sunday.
The army and passenger planes work on the supply of equipment and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, interviewed Sky News: “Every minute a car comes with a body.
There's nothing about clean water.
The small markets have been robbed everywhere."
In a interview with CNN, Jan Gelfand, the international leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, said: “Indonesian Red Cross struggles with finding survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but could go worse."
Joko Widodo, president of Indonesia, arrived at Pala on Sunday, saying to the country army: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the missions related to the elimination.
Are you ready?" said in a news from CNN.
Earlier this year, earthquakes crossed Lombok, India, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini is now saying that the same is missing after a plane collapsed into a land.
The airline, which had a plane that crashed into a lone in Milan, now says that one man is missing, after earlier said that all 47 passengers and crews had been saved from the sanking plane.
Air Niugini reported that since Saturday after the afternoon, it did not know about the reception of one male passenger.
The airline said that he was working with the authorities of the place, hospitals, and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped save the other passengers and the crew after the plane crashed into the water when she tried to land on the airport on the Chuuk Island.
On Friday, representatives said that seven people had been transferred to hospitals.
The airline said that six passengers were still in a hospital on Saturday and that they were constant.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and the exact order of the events.
The airline and the U.S. marine army said that both the plane had arrived in the land before the route.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had gone too far over the airport.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the aircraft had been very low.
"It was really good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others could quit the middle - depth of the water and reach emergency exits in the falling plane.
He said that the pilots had been scared and crying and that he had had little headaches.
The U.S. mariners, who were at the time of work from making a bridge, also helped the rescue by using the blossom boat to land, before the plane dropped up to about 30 feet [30 m] of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Agency show that 111 people have died in the last two decades of flight accidents of PNG recorded aircraft, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening that a woman was burned alive
Attorneys concluded their speech on Saturday in the re-introduction of a person accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the US Ministry of Justice, was at the courtroom for many hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He explained how he used cell phone records to gather the travel of the accused 29 - year - old Quinton Tellis, and the 19 - year - old Jessicu Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said that she had got location data from a few mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the evening she died, contrary to his previous claims, according to the news of The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chamber at the same time as he said he had been with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said that he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked that Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s car that evening, Sanford said that it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that she knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Physics showed that they had only been known for one week.
Rowlett said that once after Chamber’s death, Tellis had removed text messages, phone calls, and contact information from her phone.
“ He destroyed her out of his life, ” said Hale.
It is estimated that protectors will present their final talk on Sunday.
The Judge said that it was expected that the matter would be postponed later on that day.

Another black person?
Embedded in New York, lawful couples for extermination by "prejudicing" text messages
After receiving a surprising text message from the mother, a child in New York, a lawful couple complained that she was “a true black person. ”
The couple refused to be prejudiced and similar to the law of “discrimination. ”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, declared displeasing when she found that her new foetus, Giselle Maurice, was black when she was able to work for the first time in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent them two times to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her mistakes, she was experiencing a “pleasant” Plasco-Flaxman Miss Maurice and said that the ex-foether of the elderly had stood badly, and that she had expected to receive a Philippine woman, according to a news from the New York Post.
Miss Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home to Uber car.
Maurice now legally advocates the couple and wants to get improvements because of the elimination, that a sum of $350 a day before six months of the work she had been initially advised, although no contract was signed.
“ I wanted to show them that you shouldn’t do so, ” she interviewed Post on Friday, adding: “I know this is a difference. ”
The couple have protested the accusations of being prejudiced and said that it was the right thing to expel Maurice, because they felt that they could not trust her after being offended.
“ My wife sent her a message that she wouldn’t say.
She's not prejudiceful.
We are not prejudicing people," said the husband Joel Plasco to Post.
“ But who would trust his children for someone after exercising such dishonesty, even though it was surprising?
His newborn child?
Come on. "
Plasco compares the law with “discrimination, ” saying that his wife had arrived seven months and was in“ difficult circumstances. ”
“Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It's not very beautiful done," said Plasco, who works in the investor.
The case is still in court, but the public has made a harsh statement about the social media couple and has shamed them of their conduct and reasoning.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would have difficulty with speaking bears, says in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said: “It’s hard to put in the footsteps of someone who reads her for the first time before she was released.
“ It is very funny now that we know of the enormous success of Paddington.”
She said that her father, who worked as a recorder at the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a small toy, had rejected his works with a calm positive attitude, and added that the sixteenth anniversary of the book was “hearty” after his death in the past.
Concerning Paddington, which she describes as a “abound of an important family member, ” she added that her father had proved silent proud of his success at last.
“ He was a very quiet man, and he was not used to mount himself, ” she said.
“ But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like when you had a child who accomplished something, and you are proud of it even if you did nothing really.
I think he's ever looked like Paddington's success.
Though Paddington was creative and his imagination, he always gave Paddington himself the honor."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been moved to Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad regularly called and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then Nad called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to maintain her heart rate were gradually losing their activity and being excluded from the body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the body to give up.
I had to sit and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I could not cry or cry, because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now grieved her dead daughter, went to the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the difficulties she experienced.
"None knew anything," she said.
“ I killed my head, and my tears fell all the time.
It is hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt deep compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Faithful women hang up messages to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who had loved ones who had suicide now try to prevent others from taking life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help.
Tyler, Miss Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide when he was 18 years old.
“ I don’t want any parent to suffer as I have to suffer every day, ” she said.
Miss Davis, 45 years old, lives in Lydney and said that her son was a successful cook with an infectious smile.
“ He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could describe any room."
He quit working before he died, for he was “socked down into a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11 years old, found his brother dead after his own life.
Miss Davis said: “I am constantly worried about the consequences of it. ”
Miss Davis made the message “to let people know that it is possible to go and talk to others, even friends.
Don't sit and say nothing - you need to talk to someone."
Miss Humphreys, who has been a friend, Miss Davies, lost Mark, her mate to 15 years old, shortly after his mother died.
“ He didn’t say that he felt bad or was depressed or something like that, ” she said.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his humility.
He was on his worst on Christmas, when the children opened his gifts, he didn't look in their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great distress for them, but they had to grow up from it: “This was a trick for the family.
It's gonna break us apart.
But we have to keep on fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaughs hangs on a blue thread when the FBI has his research
"I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - study with limited time and amount - maybe we could reach a little good," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was to be "submitted" in the middle of a dispute between the classes where everything was in the back.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his supporters from the reputations group not want the FBI to investigate the matter?
Their treacherousness is due to the timetable.
The Middle Ages are in only five weeks, November 6, and if the reputations, as expected, are bad, they are weakening their serious attempts to make their husband choose to sit in the country’s Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senators to urge them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met her wife Ashley through him, who was a private man, Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI releases his research report?
The vote will be held at the Elderly Division meeting, where 51 reputants and 49 Democrats are sitting as they are.
It is still uncertain whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes on the body of the elders, but this would enable President Mike Pence to break up the same level and confirm it in the office of the Supreme Court.
The number of people flying North Korea “slights” under Kim's control
The number of people flying North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a Senator from South Korea.
Park Byeong-seven, quoted data from the South Korea Association Council and said that 1127 people had fled in the past, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that a more stringent border warrant between North Korea and China and a higher amount of smugglers with people were key factors.
Pyongyang has not published any public declaration.
The vast majority of those flying North Korea are invited to receive the South Korean national law.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 inhabitants from North Korea have illegally crossed the borders from the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest border that lies to North Korea, and it is easier to cross them, rather than the well-related neutral area between North and South Korea.
China views the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their homeland.
Transaction between North and South Korea, still in war, technically seen, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions that were mainly subject to delayed negotiations on nuclear weapons.
This was after a historical meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together in the direction of a nuclear-free Korean.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong Ho, foreign minister of North Korea, taught American business requests about the lack of progress then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country, and under such circumstances, it is impossible for us to take down our nuclear weapons first,” said in Ri in his speech at the SD General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “mother sick” and says he is unable to perform the work of the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the assembly, called Brett Kavanaugh, a appointed Supreme Judge “Mother sick” and said that he was too humble to be able to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these words fall in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“ I could only think that if a woman had ever done so, she would have been called mother sick, ” said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Elderly Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh rejected with great feeling the accusations that he had accused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
In his opening talk, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes cried up near it and got a cook in his neck when he talked about his family and his school years.
He also condemned officially the Democrats of the Committee and called the accusations on him “incessant and organized murder” organized by free - minded men who were angry about the loss of presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not operate in the Supreme Court, for he showed that he was partial to democracy.
“I think that these statements and how he attacked the Clinton couple and democrats show that he is incompatible to the work,” she said.
Pelosi did not answer when she was asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh out of work if he was confirmed and if democrats reach the majority of the meeting.
“ I will say this: if he is not telling the council or the FBI the truth, then he is not only incapable of being in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh now performs the work of Judge at the court court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she would be concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the health law Devoable Care Act or the abortion law Roe v. Wade, since he is considered to be an intentional judge.
At the interrogation, Kavanaugh asked whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“ This is no time for a mother - sick, participant person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say “much is it wonderful. ”
And women need to make use of it.
This is a righteous speech, a month, and a year of wrath, and it does not come from herself without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
“ I think it is not unusual, but you? ”
She continued, “I received a great help from a woman who was a manager somewhere, saying that she was crying too when she was angry, but she had developed technology so that when she was angry and began crying, she said to her interviewer,“ You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I felt it was great."
Threads are allowed to express some anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories from my former work at the office of men in the majority, where I began to cry out of angry I couldn’t speak, an older woman came and took my knocking trumpet, a cold boss that I had always been afraid of, and she drew me into a stairway.
“ Don’t let them see you cry, ” she said to me.
They don't know you're a blast.
They believe that you are sad, and rejoice in reaching you."

In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested with a proselyte on board in a boat named Monkey Business (Apaspiel) and drew its presentation back, Mrs. Schroeder, thought that there was no reason why she could not consider offering herself to President.
“ This was not a good decision,” she laughing to me, 30 years later.
“ There were already seven other tenderers and the last one they needed was one more.
Someone gave this name “Mill white and the seven dwarfs.”
As long as the election campaign had passed, she was after what was going on with the resources, so she promised not to offer herself unless she could collect $2 million.
There was a lost fight.
She found that some of her supporters gave her $1,000 for men only $250.
“ Do they think I’ll be disfellowshipped? ” she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not offer herself formally, she was so embarrassed by feelings - appreciation to the people who had supported her, angry with the system, which made it so difficult to gain money and direct her vision to the voters instead of representatives, and angry into sexual abuse - that she broke into tears.
“ I might have had a nervous attack, ” said Miss Schroeder when she recalls how the media responded.
“ Kleenex could be my supporter.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my leg?
"She cried?"
The reason why business war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the business war between the United States and China were devastating, and even though the war is far from the end, the lands could be favourable to Beijing for a longer time, says experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, shot the first warning shot earlier this year by paying tax on China’s main export goods, including sunbursts, steel, and aluminum.
This week, the highest score was made by new taxes that overcome 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds) and taxes about half of all the goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has answered in the same coins each time, and recently, 5 to 10 percent of taxes on American products amounted to $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States’ taxation, and it is unlikely that another world’s largest economic system will pass away.
To get Washington to hop, we need to comply with requirements, but it would be too degrading for Xi Jinping, the president of China to turn off the United States in public.
However, experts say that if Beijing is right on the cards, pressure from the business war with the United States could have a positive effect on China for a longer time, by reducing the mutual need for both economic systems for each other.
“The fact that the rapid political decision either in Washington or Beijing could lead to the circumstances that lead to economic disruption in each country, is really far more dangerous than the audiences have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses mainly on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria is prepared for the return of refugees, says the Foreign Minister.
Syria says that it is ready for refugees to return to the country, seeking help to rebuild the country, which is now in bad condition after seven years of war.
Walid al Moualem, a foreign minister, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, saying that the situation in the country was getting worse.
“ Today, the conditions on earth are steady and safer, thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism, ” he said.
The government continues to develop normal circumstances by building areas that were destroyed by terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to return to the country that they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic decisions that were directed against their daily lives and employment.
It is estimated that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country from the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million more, still living in the country, need help.
Al-Moualem said that Syrian authorities would like to take help in rebuilding the country.
However, he emphasized that they would not accept assistance depending on conditions or assistance from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder’s cup in Paris
The European Union has won Ryder cup 2018 by victory the United States team with the final score of 16.5 at 10,5 points on the Le Golf National Velle outside Paris, France.

The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Oles from Denmark, which was at the bottom of the order of the players in the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, which played possible in its last race on Ryder's beker.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times about Ryder’s bike, became the most victorious European racer at 25.5 grades.
“ I’m not crying, but today I can’t do anything else.
It's been a hard year.
I am so grateful to have chosen me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
This is about the team, and I was pleased to be able to help," said the emotionally rich Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He judges his lands John Rahm, but he conquered the American golf decree Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
“ I was incredible proud of overcoming Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him, ” said the 23 - year - old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four games in France and is now recorded with 13-21-3 in the race around Ryder's bike.
This is a strange conclusion for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 big titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulty all weekend by finding himself on the field, beside Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
Jim Furyk, the U.S. leader of the United States, said, “I am proud of them, they fought.
It was someday the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him.
I'll take up for Thomasi.
He's a great team.
All his 12 players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with PGA in the United States, and called Ryder's cup, and we'll continue.
I love these 12 men and I'm proud of being their leader.
You gotta get out of here.
They played better than we."
