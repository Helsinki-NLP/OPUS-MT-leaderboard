Triumph of the Right Population in Austria, totally 29 percent
A remarkable weakness of both parties of the previous great coalition and a significant strengthening of the legal political parties brought after the first preliminary results the preferred parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffers particularly early losses, where the position of the previous president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the cup.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is equipped for a triumphal return to the Federal Policy.
According to the previous results, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains with 29.8 per cent of votes the strongest force in the country, but it loses 5.5 per cent of votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian post-war history, and especially in the People's Party, which demanded the preferred elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had expired from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear precedent before the SPÖ.
However, the voters probably punished the party for having the government failed.
In the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible withdrawal of the party chairman and previous Vice-President Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Board of Parties.
Such development would probably lead to the most likely way out of the election debakel, i.e. to renew the great coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both legal political parties - the liberal (FPÖ) received preliminary 18 percent, the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears, that 1999 could repeat when the People's Party had agreed with the populists (then the FPÖ was still unified, in 2005 it had divided from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even resulted in sanctions from the European Union.
For this development, Jörg Haider, who already explained that he was willing to cooperate with each party and goes from a return to Vienna to the Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the Green Party also entered the House, which, however, suffered slightly losses and took place among the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party probably mastered the four-percent door and therefore did not enter Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool down
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India for the illegal collection of bugs, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that it could lead to a certain cooling of the Czech and Indian relations.
The Minister in New York emphasized this after today's meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this doesn't clarify, then surely, then it comes to a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the discussions, the executives could only be difficult to intervene in judicial matters.
Nevertheless, he argued that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the charge and received a penalty penalty to the central government with the local government in Dardjiling, where the matter falls.
"The problem could be clarified," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, which was sentenced to three years of liberty, Mukherdshi's view is the best if he would go to appeal at a higher instance.
He could as such ask for the release of insurance and wait in freedom for his judgment, so the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had spoken in the same way in negotiations.
"He recommends a appeal at a higher court, then a favor would be questioned for him," said the Chief of the Czech Diplomation.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the condemned "competent legal assistance", the Indian minister suggested.
At the same time, he said that such aid was already offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, the Czech Press Agency ČTK, before his partner, confirmed the Czech Republic's problem of the Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a great mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
An answer to the question whether he had received the promise of the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister left out.
"I was already very much promised," he simply found.
A Czech judges the ring around the sea ground
It comes to an electronic map on which Australia and the surrounding sea areas are formed.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also to the surrounding sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is a member of the thirty-found staff team of the UN Divison for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His boss, the Divisions Director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, is following the interpretation and supplements it.
Here there are workelans and enthusiasm.
The seaground has so far been a little known world, which is rich in natural sources.
Here you can find oil, further arc and other non-proliferational raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to developing a medicine against cancer.
A sea ground larger than the mainland
The countries of Antarctic today announced their right to the new sea areas.
After a UN Convention, they use their rights to which they agreed in the year 1982 in Montego Bay to Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a hundred kilometres far from the shore of a country into the sea.
This country, according to the Convention, has exclusive right to all sources of continental shelf.
"Simply expressed, as a continental shelf, the part of the sea floor and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the borders of the shore, often also the border of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted to the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be demonstrated by a comprehensive scientific-technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the three last countries had success," adds Mikulka.
On an international ecoch recently, Australia’s success, which could significantly increase its sea areas as the first country.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the sea soil that the Commission has approved the country last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit of the use of the sea soil will, as they promise, have an invaluable value in the future.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
There, where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean soil, which is referred to by the Convention as the "common heritage of mankind".
There's no State in this place that's a special position.
The right to promote in this area gives an international institution established by the Convention.
"The soil of the sea is not a golden grave country," means with some excessive director Mikulka and adds, "who's individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
A part of the sea floor is also a part of the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other countries of the former East Block in the framework of the Interocean Metal Joint Organization.
This was received in 1991 because of the Convention, as well as the investors of some less countries, the status of a so-called "crawling investor".
The organization has the right to promote the area of ClarionClipperton in the Pacific between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the ground of the sea.
"There can be promoted on a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich foundation of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and mangan", said another lawyer, the Inder Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such a concretion as a pattern.
She reminds of a little potato or, with some imagination, of the legend that brought life to life after the Golem.
German special forces were in the case of local ferry liberation
The Egyptian government had requested aid from Germany to solve the hostile crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
In the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt, more and more details are known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue action.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Federal War and officials of the GSG 9 were the Flyerstaffel of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Work at the location of liberation.
However, as spoken by the ministeries on Monday evening, the German forces were not required because the hostages let their prisoners run and flee when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as local support forces.
"Happy it hasn't come to this," said one speaker of the Federal Ministry.
The travel group had kidnapped the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19th in the south of Egypt.
After kidnapping in a wilderness area in the south of Egypt, the hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been dragged down and down.
Lastly, the identity of the hosts remained unclear as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived well in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the guard of the German message.
He did not express himself to details of the release.
In Berlin there was no information at first when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Image" newspaper, the five vacations and special forces are to be floated with an airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative House rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has made the 700 billion dollars of heavy rescue package for the financial markets hardly fail.
The Dow Jones shattered into the depth.
With 206 votes to 227, the US Representative House rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeal of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme to reduce the chaos to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince critics still of the 700 billion dollars hard package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on the Members to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
In the course of the vote, Dow Jones broke up by more than six percent or by 600 points.
Reasons were the concerns of investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after notified of the failure, again.
Experts are now expecting further severe turbulences on the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Members and the Senate is necessary for the programme's entry into force.
Organizers record increasing booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel organizers:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to one study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans' desire to travel remains uncomfortable in a study.
In the bookings for the winter season, the travel offices recorded a salesplus of 31 percent compared to the previous year period, as announced by the German Travel Association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK market research institute, booking numbers have already increased for the autumn months.
Thus, the salesplus of the travel offices for October amounted to about eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV announced.
The basis for these results is the numbers of the GfK, which evaluate monthly booking data from 1200 German travel offices and calculate high for the overall market.
The travel bookings took place by the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar rate, travels to the United States were particularly requested, the DRV announced.
Here the booking growth is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic fildes, are specially requested destinations for the Germans.
Especially pace trips are high in the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increased costs of energy and food, the costs are "beter calculable for customers than for individually organized holidays".
Among other things, money could save consumers through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very well booked, so that a sales plus will be recorded compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who traveled decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time of October Festival
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless slide, beer from liter-crows and promises in designer dirndln.
It's a spoiling debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much shared.
She is a blond, a TV modernator and wears a customized Dirndl.
I have dark hair, is a student and my dress is second hand.
One thing, however, connects us: A few minutes on the grass, the photographers are falling on us and cutting the memory cards full - very delicious and that on my first meadow visit.
That's how you make yourself friends.
The Billig-Dirndl seems to fulfil its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the White Wheat Staffator, the well-being in the trait remained bound to date.
But only once the Theresienwiese arrived, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather hosn; no one looks responsive or embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Beautiful looks at the chocobanan stand only harvest my tails.
A coin reminds me that I would have bound the shelter wrongly: "Links hook free, middle virgin, right forgiven, backwitched."
Hirely, I'll freeze the slide from the back to the left.
"Pass," it said and laughed.
Others make less effort for subtle flirt techniques and wear simple filtle huts on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretches the naked back to an unpleasant one.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is Bob, comes from England and also visits the October Festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "oooooo".
He tells me that after he's done his previously drunk measure.
Besides one of these hydrans, everyone thinks he's a trash.
So Bob is one of these famous "Wildbieslers".
Others do not have the luck to get rid of the alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, sanitaries run over the festival that needs to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the rudel - always four at once take a thorough bearing of tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty, full back.
You can't see who's lying in the promille sarg under the plane.
"These are those where goartakers pack," one of the sanities called to me on request and disappeared in the gum.
The name of the accident victim made known by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female fussmate who died in the hospital after she was driven by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the middle of the city.
She was taken to Queen's hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident due to suspicious driving.
In the meantime, he was released for insurance.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey endeavored to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in entering into Turkey's backland.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed, emperial pursuit.
The Hydarpasha Bahnhof was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the guides tell you.
The building sits ridtling at the end of the station with a tower on every corner of the front and thus looks like any provincely German council.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building crashes about
But once you're within the wooled ticket switch, there is no doubt about the excellence of the project, whose most Western access this was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolien-Bagdad Society.
Germany, who was a late driver in the imperialist game, had implemented before his ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damascus, Bagdad, and further beyond what is Saudi Arabia today.
But Germany's imperialist project was paralyzed during the first world war.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence by Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the unoverwindable limits of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces extracted from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Train Station.
In 1917, an ammunition train floated into the air, with the artificial roof destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly broken, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as the gate to anatolia and all east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the Czech Republic.
The ruling Party of Justice and Development, the ACP, has introduced an unfortunately new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, produced by the limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a approach policy.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian division groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the corners of this new foreign policy, I went to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish Member Suat Kiniklioglu.
On the next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hole-price ride on tracks that produced the equation of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered as a new city, for the new worldly state project, to return to the Eastman past.
However, the ACP, which is known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has caused some distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the main business office of the ACP, a specially designed ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developed premises, surrounded by half-finished shopping centres and knees in which medium managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Dressing, Krawatte, I'm sure he's even packed a blackberry.
"The objective of the Party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its backland.
Today she has to look at the East and the West at the same time.
There wasn't either one or the other.
She had to do both.
"But certainly Turkey could at any time," I asked, "tving to decide?"
"Turkey," he said, "will not have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are equally advantageous for Europe and the United States, as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, so the message seems to be, in the transmitted sense, Europe as a whole can travel eastwards towards Asia and the Middle East as a whole.
Back at the Hydarpashas Railway Station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German governments, Mr. Rider and Mr Conu, who had watched this construction 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too widely, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited for the ferry to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe".
At least at that time, there seemed to be little doubt about which continent should have a right to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon was "Death" Handley (nex call on 11 September) responsible for the Guildford Philharmoniker and Chor.
As part of his musical program for the city, he founded his great youth chor, Proteus, the following year.
He was intended for youths up to 21 years, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological form exchanger) was for the willingness and ability of the chore, any musical piece that was presented to him to attack, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young chore was often amazing, always exciting, and was alone thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never leaves for years.
How often we were killed by "to let the music speak for themselves".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sings!"
His type of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never glorious, but never surpassing.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had to be hit to the rider, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he was leading the Guildford Philharmoniker.
In the past 40 years I wrote criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by one alone - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He disgraceed the conductors, according to his words, simply "with one or two known scaffolds went home in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that in 1946 he reaffirmed the education of the economic history in Oxford and received a Houblon-Norman Research Study in 1950 ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate.
This is a conclusion from a note of authors in Woodruff's book "Onside of Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a teacher of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and during that time he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, later published as "The British rubber industry".
He was in 1950-1951 in the United States in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship and spent the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It's not known why Woodruff wanted to consume this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black-white, in documentary style.
They made me aware of them because of their slightness and the power they radiate, as they always deal with respect for the protagonists.
A exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments."
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda embarks on the marketing of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large space limousine still bids a much larger one.
This also includes the technical fences that allow even more comfortable driving and petrol to save.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, estheticly seen, the new Jazz shows a similar line to his predecessor, the changes made in this great limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism will be emphasised.
However, before you start analysing the new model, you must say that this new Jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, honda, compared to the other manufacturer, was able to renew this model for a shorter period.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon with regard to its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where Jazz is the most sold car of 2002 and also this year 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second sales market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japan sold a total of 83,000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars. This is 17% of the estimated growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002. This is 6.7% of the total selling in Honda in Spain.
As regards the new generation of the model, the heads of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model enables the sales reduction in Spain to be exchanged.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22,000 models. These are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to be able to reach the 2% in 2010.
In order to achieve this share, honda is putting on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models per year throughout the world.
According to Japan’s market estimates, 50 % of Insight models are sold in the United States while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of the Insight on the market is intended for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, resulting in the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters.
The height, however, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with increasing dimensions, the inner space is also enlarged.
This success is, on the one hand, the new space flexibility programme and, on the other hand, the central position of the fuel container, a solution that was also used in Jazz's predecessor model.
The capacity of the cabinet room, which has a system of double load surface, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation bag room.
It must be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litre petrol engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz bag room is 379 litres with a 1,2-liter fuel engine.
Among other improvements, except the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of building panorama windows, the access to seats is improved.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first Jazz only had 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 performances of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and simultaneous turn-moment performance for the entire engine running time.
The first variant of 1,2 litres achieves the performance of 90 PS at 6 000 rotations with a maximum speed of 114 Nm at 4 900 min ?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 PS at the previous generation, he now creates 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`Auto-Biene', which avoids collisions
In order to promote the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarm behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
Engineers from the technical development centre of Nissan Motor Co have developed this little robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the famous University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the director of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four layers of Nissan Security Shield.
This robot should ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight room, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important is the facet eye of the bee, which can see over a angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing them to fly uninterrupted in their personal airspace without interruption.
To imitate the roundum perspectives, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are in front of the BR23C in the distance up to two meters and are in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a tabley microprocessor, which is translated directly into signal for avoiding collision
`In the moment when obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference between other systems is that this excessive manoeuvre is absolutely instinctive.
If it would not, the robot could not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the laboratory for mobility and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot vary upwards or downwards, but also not overcover; he can only move into two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to rotate his wheels and not in the infinite directions and in an infinite way as it makes the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and disruption functions so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act according to these information.
It does not require the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres made, so it can continue to work with just a few dozen KBs of the storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan prophesied in the series cars for the next ten years.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and keep longer than a variety of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead to the goal and avoid obstacles on the road.
She's bitching before she's got a hypothecism.
It must be realized that the US Ministry of Finance, except that it has a sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not unfit.
Before the crisis and to avoid the involvement of the U.S. citizens in hypocritical history of the so-called payable banks, an entertainmental and informative game for the Internet surfers was developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', says it.
Or maybe, the "Hotel of Bad Credits" or the Divergent.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially his receptionist is to think about one, two and up to three times, whether it's the moment not to ask for any credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Surely it has useful information, but without details.
This is rather a page for the teenagers, than a place for all audiences.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into her company, which would be the first bank in Japan, which will spend nine billion dollars and thus take 21% of their capital, a new one due to a strong case of their stock exchange rate.
One week after a preliminary agreement had been made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley stamps at a single price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is less than 19% of the price value of the share from 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertable shares that will guarantee a profit of 10% and can be sold again at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business will be done on the basis of a single average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current price value.
However, Morgan Stanley-Actie fell by 6.79% at $23.07 by 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic connection is an important opportunity to speed up the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank," explained John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which would allow him to expand its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of the Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed over the last days: Last Monday Morgan had simply explained that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about 8.5 billion dollars to Japan.
"A week ago," explained Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, "we thought that the participation would consist entirely of family shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below their price value for their Morgan Stanley actions.
And the business will go with a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential acts to family shares if the latter is exchanged to more than 50% over the sales value within a given period, i.e. to some 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the money supplied by MUFG will enable him to use investment options, to strengthen their balance and to increase their sales.
However, a press speaker of the group refused to make more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a payment capacity rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that since the end of August, his balance has been 'definite'.
The last few weeks were hard for the group who had to watch how their stock exchange rate fell by half, while the price of insurance against incapacity speeded up to the height.
This price decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only survivor of the big investment banks at Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, $15 billion, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic reconstructed around the 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezolaner Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorial Rafael Correa.
That third party, following this Sunday, the example of his companions and friends, made the plan of a new Constitution for election.
Mission is fulfilled because, according to the 80% of the voters, the public results were 64% in the referendum with 'Yes'.
According to these results, 28% matched 'No', 7% of the voting list were invalid and 0.7% were released empty.
In order to adopt the Constitutional Project, more than half of all votes given must be voted.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out on the exits of the elections and a counting of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for `Ja', and prophesied it 63% to 70%.
In the night of Sunday on Monday, Rafael Correa had requested the victory of his constitutional project.
The Constitution triumphed in an overwhelming way, he had been in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometres southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorials.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his chilenese equally gentle Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence in accordance with the Observatory of the Organization of the American States (OAS), refers to a text of 444 points for the protection of 'new socialism' for which the President is engaged.
The Constitutional Project transfers state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'Development Planning' in a country, mostly living from the oil promotion by foreign companies and by the exchanges that send foreigners to the country.
The project, which is predominantly driven by the CORREA in 2006, also gives the Head of State greater power, which will be able to exercise up to two successive mandates of four years, and will have the opportunity to resolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already started to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants living in 50% of the population below the poverty limit.
Finally, it also proposes to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an equatorial support point as an starting station for American anti-drug use.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the elf tourist kidnappers and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive for eleven days in the desert, were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning they had been released from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently, at 3:30 a.m., the hostages reached the military base al-Maza right next to the international airport of Cairo at a special aircraft on board.
They were direct, without being able to talk to the press, brought to the hospital on board of a helicopter from Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers 'was not paid a ransom', explained the Egyptian tourist minister Zoheir Garanna on the rollfield.
After she was captured in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libyen on September 19th, the group of hosts was brought to the next by 35 unknown kidnappers from a hiding area.
It is eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Agency Aegyptus, organizers of Safari.
A Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from board of two helicopters, have launched the attack at night, just before the morning damn.
"On both sides, shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the remaining escapes," said this responsible person who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support by German and Italian commands.
The chief of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade where he is, about the role of the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and from the special units," he explained without further details.
He also rejects the payment of a ransom.
In the evening before, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a land vehicle at a patrol, where the kidnappers were, of whom they killed six, including the leader who came from the Chad, and two arrests.
The army explained that they were associated with an army of rebels from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, immediately confronts this movement.
Letters - The quiet majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is the central topic of the current election struggle.
That's better.
But an area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise up and arrogant sums that will be granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical locations that are unfortunately hungry?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that she neglects her monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government provides 3.5 million euros alone for the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loiretal?
With our American neighbours, in the Constitution of their country, it is written that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all governmental provinces, in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the Association of the History Society of Quebec, at least 40,000 honor officials gathered in 211 history societies strive to deal intensively with history, to save the numerous private archives and to retain the archaeological remains.
They are also often the guard dogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments State parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial government, the Benelux States are seeking to take part in the arms of the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank, which has been advised by the US financial crisis in Turbulencies: the three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the Bank and Insurance Institute, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Competition Authority.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions that are now taken in connection with the bank may have a precedent.
In the sense of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the Bank to about 49 percent.
The Bank will probably sell part of its shares, all in advance the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis started a steep valley last week, in the second half of the week, serious crisis scenarios have already taken place.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too large for a Pleite.
The securities of the institution fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year depth.
Since Jänner, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share rates, the group’s market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to its management.
The management considers that the USD 700 billion expensive US rescue package and the uncertainty resulting from it in the markets is blamed for the Talfahrt der Fortis-Acts.
On Monday, however, the courses have slightly risen.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new Director-General of the Bank.
The Monetary Institute was also looking for a private buyer, but there has not been any interested one with a real offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor is supposed to crawl his money, said it.
There has been no panic among customers until now, the branches of the Bank have not been stumbled.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies her own.
Fuchs in the chickenstall
Due to the use of a person’s medication, life and health insurance in America often refuses to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could be uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes that, in any case, link the use of the drug data to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the fuchs the chickens" - quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the programme for follow-up of prescription data.
Insurances determine the fees and payments in the case of damage depending on the customer's health condition and, if the risk is too high, the insurance will not be completed.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was only concluded in the knowledge of the results of the investigation.
Ten years ago Dick found a far more favourable method: Based on the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the pharmaceuticals in the last one and a half years, talks about what preparations were bought and the program calculates from which the customer suffers and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering medicines, it was possible to follow that his blood fat levels were untreatable, which would automatically range it into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurances only have to do more of the paper crawl, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as migraine and heat wallings, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while the above mentioned does not.
For the inquiry and processing of the data, their own companies have shaped themselves, who, before they refer to the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they must do this by law, although leaves have not yet been heated.
Some companies process even the results of laboratory studies and connect them to the data on medicines, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of the patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use will be more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a private law on data protection for health, its effect is only applicable to healthcare providers and insurance.
The draft law was already presented to the Congress, in which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his programme so that the data can only be transmitted with the respondent's consent.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned may hardly forbid the access to his data, since the insurance does not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens have just left somehow the grace of the fuchs.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are the leading trading partners of each other, this was the main theme in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-India summit is also taking place, which is mainly discussed in the nuclear energy sector.
Although the European Union acknowledges that India is an exciting democratic great force, which should be given more voices and consensus law in international matters, the Member States could not agree until now whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhis in the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed yesterday at the ninth summit in Marseille.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana, received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods increased from 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this objective is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally summarised into an agreement so that air traffic will also be fleeted in the future.
India wishes to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the pact.
The aim is to create a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number one of India, New Delhi is only rank nine among the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
These were the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or the terrorism, which both sides condemned to the greatest extent, and the call for a UN Conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides responsible for failure.
The EU emphasized that it maintains its energy and climate programme, i.e. that the emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
This also agreed to India as well as the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the coming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The increase in food prices should also be combated, therefore both support the call for an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of Government today visits the French capital, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped for contracts to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's communications, the Agreement is to be decided for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Starke presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Buchmesse.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the right acquisition.
The International Frankfurter Buchmesse is expected for the current event of over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honorary guest of the event.
The sub-secretary of the Ministry of Culture and Culture Maria Giro will be represented by the Italian Government during the opening ceremony at the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented by the 264 qm large exhibition room "Punto Italia".
This will follow a press conference close to the Room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: at this opportunity figures, trends and perspectives are discussed around the publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers is reduced throughout, especially in adult and youth savings.
A year ago, the small plane of the billionary Steve Fossett refounded
Steve Fossett's small aircraft, which was found on 3 September 2007 on a flight over the desert of Nevada, was found.
The individual parts have been found on a 3000 m high platform, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammot Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully dismissed the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located on which a force was sent. Now we have the security that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett fled on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or nearby.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Office for Transport Safety (Ntsb) noted that a team had been sent a few hours after the plane's sight, which identified the machine: the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett in Yerington in Nevada had started a three-hour flight.
Last night, some of the personal items of Fossett were also found in California, near the border of Nevada, by a couple near their house at the Mammooth Lakes.
This is two references with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration by illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history by a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he succeeded in the sixth approach, when the first man went around the worldball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he fled the world in a single flight without intermediate landing with a plane.
Among its various records, a height flight of 15445 metres above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don't expect
A sov that falls from the conventional schedule through its original design and the special line direction, the outloading surface and its clear angle.
Mercedes-Benz has tried with this Offroader to take a new breath to the sector.
Just because of its extraordinary properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from 17 October.
Thus, the advertisement rummel that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also occur in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a new one in the car sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping miles of Miles of Miles, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will be composed of the presentation of the car, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special optic: the new sov will appear as a three-dimensional model in its nearly real dimensions.
In fact, the car will appear so apparently from the poster on which it is pictured.
This will be illuminated by using the elumina8 technology of the new Glk in different moments in all its details to recombine it as a whole.
Without doubt, Mercedes' concern with this advertising is to introduce a new type of authors in this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in traveling the interest of the future buyers? We will see it.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stage ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for which all Italy is now embarrassed? They are part of the grouping "Ultras Italia", who has been travelling behind the Italian team for years and which, honestly, did not cause serious problems until recently.
Never has ever happened to collapse with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, there were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia.
They wear the Tricolori where the cities of the militants appear, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Your models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a collapse with a true right-radical fanscene, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans had been made available 144 cards for the game: all were issued on names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: none of them had an ongoing stage ban.
Four fans of the Italian team, which were already preloaded in this respect, were also refused the ticket and the journey to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to introduce further steps: in this case, the arrested or expired Tifosi can expect a stage ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stages throughout Europe.
So our Hooligans will no longer put one foot into a stadium.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation cities, which could follow them little more than 150.
"This fire must be expired immediately, and that does not give such behavior the opportunity to justify it," says the Viminal.
Therefore, "Augen on especially with a view to the game of the National Team on Wednesday in Lecce."
Because in fact there is a small core of the Italian ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (sport oversight), on Tuesday the casms, which can be counted on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services that are dealing with the problem of stadium force.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the raised right arm during the hymne of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in no joy), which has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
In the past, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, comes.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but no doubt the behaviour of these 150-200 persons was a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – adding the number 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are inherited in the country of their deeds.
So far, this group had stayed in the trumpet, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will be done.
But we also speak of the peppers during the Hymne Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but allow me, there is no education...".
