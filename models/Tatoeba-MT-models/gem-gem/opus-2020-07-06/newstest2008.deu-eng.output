Food blame for European inflation
The main reason for the increase in inflation measured in the euro area was the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 countries of the euro area, the invasion was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts have been based on only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British, and Canadian Notenbank, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the headlines. It is estimated that the reduction in interest would promote the rise in raw materials prices and the slightly decrease in unemployment the development of inflation spirals.
The ECB is aimed at maintaining the inflation rate less than two percent, or at least at the two-percent mark.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in the Zwickmille: the inflation needs to be "compatible" to exclude later action needs.
With 3.3 per cent, the inflation rate reached a 12-year record high in Germany in November; in Spain the rate climbed from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
The increased food and energy prices are responsible for the increase in inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF wheat notations increased by 88 percent, and the course for soja beans also reached a record hook since 1973.
In 2007, food oil and milk products also had a significant eradication.
The world market price for raw oil rose by 52 percent this year - the price per face of the black gold reached nearly 100 US dollars last month.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but in 2009 it is estimated that it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts are out of a 3-percent inflation rate, but the average annual rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce the interest rate twice.
Gallup local government crisis
After long stagnition, the number of Fidesz sympathists has grown considerably until the beginning of December. The party has the largest base camp since 2002, while the consent for the socialists has reached a no-day level of 13 percent.
The difference is evident in the party-trade voters thanks to the high determination of opposition proposers: more than two thirds (71 percent) are a fifth (20 percent) of the MSZP's consent.
MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary entrance hird: they come to two percent in the total population.
The number of participants has grown by a percentage in both camps.
Compared to the last depth, the general economic mood has continued to worsen - never before, the proportion of those who judge the country's economic situation as "precisively bad" was so high (41 percent), while further 46 percent believe that they are "circumcisively bad".
After more hopeful prospects in spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population counts with a further worsening of the situation; only one tenth goes from an improvement.
A Gallup survey conducted in December showed that 71% of the respondents - a historic high - judged the work of the Prime Minister as "fairly as right".
Thirteen percent of the respondents have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány in general, while the share of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the Head of Government, compared with 27% mistrust against the party leader of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of political mood is the number of people who believe that it could be possible to deal with dissatisfiedness with the Prime Minister even without a change of government.
After the unrests last October, 35% have been pronounced for the remaining of the government and the Head of Government, this share is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked for their interest in the referendum, 60 percent responded that they participate "security" and another 20% would give their voting "probably".
In comparison, if Parliament's elections were held on this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the urns "security", another 15% would consider their participation "probably". In view of these trends, the result of the referendum would be seen.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fee, and 84% against the hospital day money.
The shares of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would even be 81, 84, or 89 percent.
Also the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost one fifth
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs trade area also maintained this year the average price increase of 16% of the last year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets price increases of over 1,000 HUF were registered.
After prices in the food markets were "defalopped" last December, the insurance has not been drastic compared to the still high, earlier starting level.
However, it is certainly disappointing for consumers that what they have paid for in the last year far less than 9,000 HUF is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Napi" cart exceeded the magic 10,000-HUF limit by at least 91 HUF in the markets examined.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(In 6800 the price was 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for unicum and live fish remained nearly at the level of previous years, however, the prices for poultry, nuts and coins have risen strongly.
Prices for meal and bread corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but also there were 1 kg bread woke for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price crash on the product to under 200 Forint.
It was also surprising here that the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola Pfand bottle of under 200 Forint was only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, this year in the "Napi" cart comparison also cut the most expensive, and Cora the most affordable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased the prices in the "Napi" cart compared to Christmas prices last year by 15 while Tesco and Auchan increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest cart of the previous year and the most expensive of this year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest cart last year and the cost of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase remained at 1.206.00 Forint in the previous year, however, the increase in VAT at last Christmas prices was noticeable.
Exactly this procedure has made trade angry: it seems that the goods houses could not decide the price margin they should apply to each article, as the effects of price increase on consumption were indispensable.
(If the dealer plans the circulation speed of a product poorly, it may fall by significant profits in the price margin that is based on the traffic intensity.)
Measurement-conditioning the "Napi" cart fell so radical last year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, while the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year, such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket cost more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest, there was a price increase of 1.284.00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price increase was seen, the price of daily consumption products in the hypermarkets has increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(In turn, this does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: in some basic foodstuffs, the Statistical Office established a more than 30 percent infringement for 12 months.
So in near meal also with eggs.)
However, if one looks at the "Napi" shopping cart, this seems to be almost impossible in the latter, as the price level of the product already expensive in the previous year even in the worst case has risen by just more than 10 percent.
Apparently, the meal suppliers are in a stronger position than the egg suppliers - yet they were able to revolve the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is reported on good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three warehouses are no longer looking at the prices.
It is purchased from all large quantities, durable foods are going into pallets over the store tables.
Wednesday morning morning there were endless snakes in all three warehouses at the box when suddenly the number of customers exploded.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported by the country, so many multis complain to the researchers that they could not even reach the intended sales, not only in foods, but also in sustainable consumer goods.
Many sites are saved from disinfectants
More than a thousand infections were registered in hospitals due to inadequate treatment with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overload of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not precisely due to the contamination of infections, according to the head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many sites are also saved with disinfectants.
In the Janos Hospital Traumatology Department, a MRSA infection has recently been diagnosed.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was delivered to the hospital after a severe accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was a similar infection here.
The injured car accident was released from the hospital, but a little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection. Since then, an important operation could not be performed because of the bacterium still in the patient's body.
Until 10 December of this year, hospitals reported 1094 infections triggered by multi-resistant viruses to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, according to the head of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant viruses have been recorded safely in hospitals, but the dark number is likely to be higher.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) were triggered by MRSA, the Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria wears about one third of the people in their nose without a disease.
SA-related infections (e.g. nail inflammation, mandel inflammation, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well-healable.
However, if the funds are used too high or inadequately, then antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which are rapidly spreading into hospitals under the corresponding conditions, are based on the well-reacting bacteria.
Especially in patients with weak, or permanently poor functioning immune system, but also in elderly, or low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the physician head of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents are part of the hospital all day of sickness.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, Tibor Nyulasia - MRSA suggested only where it is not searched.
Resistant to antibiotics
"Some patients are isolated, the nursing personnel wear rubber gloves and masks in supply, and we have the antibiotics needed for treatment" - so Tibor Nyulasi.
While patients are investigated on MRSA during their hospital delivery, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Test withdrawals too rare
The majority of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, but the currently prevailing conditions and circumstances would be inappropriate to prevent the development or spread of the multi-resistant inducer, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and retirement homes, the Spitals should examine the patients supplied and immediately isolate MRSA-infected patients.
In the Hungarian hospitals, however, the microbiological sampling is less frequently practiced.
Not least because there are no grants for this investigation from the public hospitals.
The majority of cases therefore would only come to light the day when the patient already has a remarkable MRSA infection, according to the physician head of the Epidemiology Centre.
There are strict recommendations from the European Union on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also directives for the treatment of certain infections and disease images in Hungary.
Antibiotics should be targeted, i.e. microbiological studies are necessary in order to avoid resistance to the means, but these directives are not always observed by hospitals.
Ambulants, or patients in the basic care, are even more rare to take microbiological samples, says Karolina Böröcz.
Suspended in the disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is most frequently transferred by one patient to the other by nursing staff.
Especially therefore, handwashing or carrying gloves and masks has a great importance, but there are also significant shortcomings in hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by drip infection or contact, but in the home hospitals there is not always the possibility of isolating the infected patients.
The rooms are even often overfilled, which beds are hardly lined together, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 metres between them from a epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröcz continues to say, in the less well-saved hospitals, there is even a saving in disinfectants, there are few nurses, many patients - all factors that are just to promote the development of infections.
Such infections are shown to be far less frequent there, or the further spread of the inducer can be stopped where these protection measures are observed, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
To handle MRSA infections causes the health insurance enormous costs, so they are fighted everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or their imminence, was maintained in the government programme.
After first signs, the programme has been successful - as published data, the trend of MRSA infections in England is decreased.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has explained the prevention of the development of multi-resistant viruses (including MRSA) and the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of its priorities.
Death leader politics were not drunk
In the case of the car accident caused by the Chief of the XXII District with fatal outcome, the official opinion is now available.
At the present time, the Chief Police of the XXII. District, who killed a walker at a car accident on Tuesday, was not alcoholized, nor under drug influence, said Attila Morvai, the press speaker of the Superior Lawyer of Budapest on Friday, after the official opinion was submitted to the case.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police chief had not consumed alcohol before he sat on tax.
The former police chief books with his own car in the XXII. District into the Kossuth Lajos street and has crossed a 55-year-old man who crossed the street on an unsigned place.
(Lout StVO, however, this is not a mild environment - the steward has, even if footsteppers do not cross the street at the Zebra Strip, afterrange.)
After his delivery to the hospital, the pedestrian is injured.
According to police reports, the driver suffered a shock, then put his functions back and asked for retirement.
The Boedapest State Attorney has initiated its investigations to the event.
Atila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the mediators from the beginning.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Martha Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three credit agreements in Budapest on Friday on the total value of EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) granted a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental projects implemented by grants from the Cohesion Fund.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan contract is also intended to apply to the budgetary financing of educational projects.
The EIB has a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, and the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will later be decided in the framework of the extension of the credit contract.
In the field of innovation, the contracting parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will be primarily covered by research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the subway line 4 was also spoken.
It was agreed that once Hungary clarifies the details of underground financing with the EU, the original contract and any modifications will be discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects of the total value of EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
The credit interest rates are EURIBOR bonded, the loan is made available by the EIB with an increase of 8 years, without provision.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate parks
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fantastic - all Europe looks at the previously rarely mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who still buys the cheapest market in the EU, but which becomes more expensive?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is now undoubtedly the most desired patch for real estate purchases in the eastern European area, with cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are among the most popular, Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "Sun Coast", and the historic towns of Sozopol and Nessebar the riders, but real estates around Kavarna and Balcik are also increasingly asked.
According to the estimates of Re/Max Analysten in Bulgaria, the country's inside also devote investors earlier or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the extremely favourable area of Russians, more buyers.
The capital of Sofia also offers enthusiastic offers - trade and office areas offer the highest profits.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive European golfer paradise, thus attracting tourists alongside the summer and winter season also in the two other seasons.
So prospective investors are already buying in large style, for example around Bansko.
Analysts believe that people who acquire real estate in Bulgaria also seek to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while there are mainly Russian buyers at the Black Sea and ski areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to stay buy either revitalised real estates by 50-100,000 euros, or downstairs of 5-15.000 euros, which they then renovate themselves.
Good connection and accessibility and communication options are largely written, but also close to a large city, shops and doctors are decisive for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday domain (Bulgaria was listed under the Top Ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group is businessmen investing with a medium to long-term value increase.
Real estate in the capital, however, becomes increasingly expensive, depending on the ever growing demand.
Within the EU, the real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the last five years there has been an increase in prices by 21 per cent per year.
The increase in the salaries at real estate prices is far higher than the increase in salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Minister for the Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will be continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on Bali's driving plan, where emissions reduction measures are set for the period after 2012, i.e. after the Kyoto Protocol expires.
There is currently a vigorous debate between industrial and developing countries.
The United States has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate through specific numbers, but they would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrial states are willing to support developing countries both financially and technologically in addition to reducing emissions.
A agreement on the support of developing countries was also reached.
The Kyoto Protocol is intended to be managed by a 16-head Council, presumably in the United Nations Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as read in the "Piac és Profit".
Hungary's six percent
Minister for the Environment of Gábor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection measures and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that by 2020, the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (as measured by the 1990 values), whether or not the "affected agreement after 2012" is achieved, or not. The Union would even be willing to use for a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrial states in the world, or developing countries are also willing to fulfil their obligations by force and responsible.
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the aim of the countries which had joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was only a reduction of 5.2 per cent, while the EU had already committed itself to a minus of 8% with its 15 Member States at the time.
The standard for Hungary is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87 - a standard that will meet the country as is to be read in the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The use is high on Bali - yet the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would certainly enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol reduction projects would not follow a new, international emissions reduction system, which also highlighted the IPCC, the international nobel price of the UN's scientific climate change committee in its recent report.
This would delay emissions reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would result in extremely serious and irreparable consequences.
British Army works on YouTube
Units of the British Army have published recordings on operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan to increase popularity on the video portal.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) YouTube has discovered for itself: Special Units stationed in Afghanistan since March 2006 have loaded videos on operations conducted against the Taliban, reports the BBC.
The miniature cameras that are mounted on helmets are checked at the Air Force Ab in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inevitable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already handled 139 such recordings, their "channel" was viewed more than 75,000 times.
The UK Defense Ministry was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in the spring of 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Foreign Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace forces (MNFI) located in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Usage in Afghanistan
Originally, the Air Force has published the videos with the aim of recruiting soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions are also intended to inform the population about the actual objectives of foreign operations.
Such a type of propaganda published is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, said Defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, but these videos always hold a certain degree of political message, as they confirm the existence right of military action adopted by the government in their own way.
Americans advertise with game
However, the army must also fight amateur recordings that, besides the carefully processed, censured recordings, create them into the network - such as those that show the death of the soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films are spoken of the losses, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
By the war scenes in Iraq and in Afghanistan, numerous videos already used on the platform have been loaded, but the British have only recently discovered.
However, the Americans advertise the kind of other kind, namely with the free downloadable shooting game "Americas Army", in which the players can swallow into the army of the soldier in a more or less vivid simulation.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministrys
The Minister of Labour, Mónika Lamperth, is not cemeterious: instead of having a Christmas celebration, she organizes a work conference where her employees can run the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministeries celebrate with live music, other magical Christmas votes with Tombola or infringements in the official hearts.
Party, Christmas vote, concerts and buffet - so celebrates power.
The Christmas fever has already recorded the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a Ministry is held in the Defense Resort, but the staff of the Ministry are not expected to do so.
At the "July celebration of the Ways" children are given by fallen soldiers, at the "Mission celebration" family members of currently stationed soldiers in abroad, but there is also a receipt for the press.
The resort provides about 25 million for celebrations.
The National Development Agency (NFC) and the Ministry of Economic and Transport struggles in comparison with other ressorts.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the House of the Future, about 350 of 600 employees are expected.
The focus of celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live-acts and a Tombola relief.
The National Development Agency (NFC) held its 4.7 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration in the House of the National Justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a festival.
The sale rental was 1 million Forint, the rest was issued for the more than 400 charged guests.
According to our information, a department of the NFC is also invited to another Christmas celebration organized by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU Money.
For the celebration, the building of the "Vigszínház" was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information because we have not reached the competent.
What's the suit for?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia Ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the OIT for the use of spaces.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a minister's speech, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
At the request of [origo], it was told: there was no ball clothing or attraction in the ball.
The Ministrys of Health, Work and Self-Management are preparing for puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organises the celebration for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Minister for Labour, Monika Lamperth, officially invites her employees not at a Christmas celebration, but to the conference on the annual sound.
You are counted with about 180 guests - the press department - only with coffee and pogate, the celebration with 350,000 forint is going out.
Minister for Self-Administration Gordon Bajnai will simply be in aula of the Ministry with his colleagues.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own festival hall, where 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was measured by 2.500 Forint per head - to this money there is a buffet reception with the following aggression.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the employees of the PM celebrate in this way each year.
However, there will be no right party vote - not only because of the minister's official speech, but also because the celebration was appointed for the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture invites the 20th Virgin to receive a new year's reception, and the Christmas celebration of the Ministry falls this time.
One hundred guests are asked to go to Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városligat"); according to the resort, the expenditure are met with 1,000 forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple reception to which foreign diplomats are loaded only in Hungary.
The receipts organized each year start traditionally with a brief meeting of the minister and sound with refusal.
As the relevant press offices report on [origo] request, there will be neither a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs nor in the Ministry of Education.
Asked for the cost of Christmas celebration, no information could be provided at the Ministry of Environment.
Anyway, more than 400 guests were loaded for a celebration, organized in the art commercial museum.
More and more powers mobilized for giant streaks
The Liga trade unions and the Hungarian trade unions Federation form their coordination committee on Friday for the undetermined length of strike starting on Monday.
On Saturday, a great meeting of protests is held, on Monday - on the day of the referendum to the health insurance law - starts the work reduction.
It is calculated with strike-related, significant traffic barriers, as rail transport is almost totally stopped, and the Budapest public transport operations (BKV) also strike up to 13 o'clock.
Details of the strike on Monday are jointly announced on Friday afternoon by the League of trade unions and the Federation of trade unions.
It is also established a LIGA - MOSZ Streik Committee responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
On Saturday a protest-growing meeting will be held, and from Monday all organisations who have joined the strike shall set down the work for undetermined time, provided no agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of the strike on the day of Parliament's vote on the health insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not accept the health insurance law, the trade unions shall immediately withdraw the call for strike.
However, when the law is adopted, the Structural Committees shall meet to consult on the further approach.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even possible that it will come to vote on the health insurance law only in the later evening hours, or even at midnight.
The strikes that start on Monday will have to be expected with significant traffic disabilities: the railwayers put their work down for undetermined time, the majority of public transport and more than half of Volán society are still in the morning.
At the same time, there will be a lot of motorway locking one direction.
The call for strike has been followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organisations announced strikes at undetermined time, other plans for temporary reductions.
Until Thursday afternoon, between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the free trade union of the railways VDSZZ could not be agreed on sufficient services, although, just around Christmas celebration, more and more people are on the road.
According to previous reports, the BKV from operating start to 13 o'clock, at the Budapest Airport from 7 to 9 o'clock, the LIGA trade unions for electricity and heat energy put the work down for four hours, and the teacher's trade union, for example, called the Democratic Teacher's trade union to 2 or 2-8 hours of strikes.
The Hungarian Doctoral Association stretches all over the country at different times, the EDDSZ, the Democratic Faculty of Workers in Health and Social Affairs, a sub-organization of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of trade unions, holds a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the government withdraws the draft reform of health insurance and presents a new concept for social discourse.
The second requirement concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from the following year.
Requirement No 3 is that the claimed professional groups will be allowed access to the early pension system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the PSKZ, which belongs to the League of trade unions, has not accepted the offer that the Transport Ministry presented the side lines and now calls for a new approach.
Political Capital: Hungarian Garde increases State risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Garde, founded in this August, have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects, with the support of the "motion for a better Hungary".
The Institute's "Risico Warning Report" states, among other things, that in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Garde, the highest political risk represents the "intense of existing ethnic tensions between the Zigeuner and the non-Zigeun population in Hungary, which could even lead to violent ethnic conflicts in the short term".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Garde, which is probably aimed at provoking such a dispute, according to the Research Institute.
As reported, this is considered to be a failure of the political responsibilities: "Persons of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groups, which have now built their political strategy on the Roma ungarn-generation."
It is suspected that this would intensify the problem, make the reasonable dialogue impossible, promote extremities and increase the probability of violent conflicts.
The research institute also believes that the activities of the Hungarian garde, not least thanks to the enormous attention of domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary in abroad significantly damaged, especially in terms of trust in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember that since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been continually suspended, so several organisations called "national self-defence association" have been founded since summer 2007.
"These groups are meant to define themselves as civil organizations, while they openly pretend to prepare their members for - sometimes armed - defense tasks (catatropism protection, national defence, order protection), calling on the inappropriateness of the police, army, or the state itself," said it.
And further: This is what happens in accordance with the method that seeks to take into account different political and political efforts as a civil initiative based on the political and party controversy of the population.
Thus, the emphasis on civil character and the form of association is not just a means of circumvention of legal barriers that could occur during the course of registration at courts - it is a political strategy at the same time.
As the analysis shows, the activities of the Hungarian Garde are also a risk-steigering factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Garde was quoted in several neighbouring states as a potential source of danger, so some ultranational politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the development of the Hungarian Garde confirmation of their own anti-ungarn policy.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region."
From the point of view of the research institute, the establishment of the Hungarian Garde is not a single phenomenon in Central-East Europe, thus the political risk for the whole region has grown.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Garde are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Garde, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the Legal Extreme Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the context of the creation of the Bulgarian garde, the Roma Mass Exhibitions took place in a district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents immediately to the occasion for the establishment of the National Guard, with the argument that the objective of the organisation of "national protection" is.
Their opinion is that in the past 17 years, there has been a regular "Zigeunerterror" in Bulgaria, but the state remained tateless and indifferent - so Political Capital.
And further: the initiative would have taken place in a violent debate in Bulgarian public.
As said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to establish their own garde for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian garde have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma also responds to the threats with organising their own protection, it says in the Risk Warning Report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said on request of the news office: The risk analysis is one of the research institutes' activities.
Annually, risk analysis reports would be published and risk-changing trends should be identified, public opinion will be informed as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are legally regulated, so that the practice of redisposing the working days has now been established around the holidays, but the next year, we have fewer such days.
In the EU and America, you understand something different in the "Fearday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between state celebrations and unemployed days.
Workless days are mostly church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we celebrate new year: both the last day of the old and the first day of the new year are working-free days - the latter alone can rest the Silvester celebrates.
All of us have fourteen holidays throughout the year.
The national celebrations are the 15th March, which reminds of the revolution of 1848, and the 23th October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On 20 August, the state foundation, celebrating the work on 1 May, will be remembered on 1 and 2 November.
There are also two holidays at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall to a weekend, the practice of "working day shift" has proved in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
The price of the extended weekends, however, is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
When this day, which falls before or after the holiday, will finally be completed, has been set by the Minister of Labour in a regulation for many years.
The law applies to all employers and employers, to public employees and officials of the public service.
Except, only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. also on holidays.
The Rules of Procedure will only be put into practice by the holidays on the end of the year: from 24 December, life remains formal, as most people take time for the days between Christmas and Silvester, or the specially lifted vacation.
In the next year, more holidays fall in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so there will be less redisponsibility in the working days than this year.
The calendar is put on the head first around the day of work, so that people can stay at home at the same time four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2, can be a rest day.
The second redisponsibility depends on the holiday on 23 October: On Saturday, 18 October, you will have to work on Friday, 24 October in advance.
However, the end of the year will remain in the sign of the holidays, after all lies and remains from 24 December, even if Silvester falls on Wednesday.
Six distressing little things to irritate colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never receive - harmless lies that no longer notice us: they bring "color" into everyday life at the workplace.
The question is simply whether you are accustomed to these small discomforts, or you better face the challenge and try to avoid these misunderstanding situations consciously for other angry situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I've forgotten to fix you that someone called from the Marketing Department," says a colleague.
That you have missed a meeting?
In the best case, you regret and try to make it good again by perhaps calling the marketing department and repentantly confessing that you had forgotten to correct the message (that is the less usual method).
Mostly, the matter has been done with an apology.
Before you get involved in angry excuses, you should consider what can really make your colleagues unpleasant moments and try to avoid these situations consciously.
Something that doesn't belong to you?
There's hardly something more nervous than if you want a document, office accessories, or the phone, but it's not there.
Last night, the elevator was still on the desk - this morning it's gone?
Or is the lost bullet writer discovered on the desk of a colleague?
Without question, you should not borrow anything from the colleagues, because they are rightly angry when they find that something has gone away.
So, no couverts or post-it from the office put in the bag, because it could hit you yourself: nothing anymore if you need it urgently.
Wedding about the private life of the colleagues?
There is no effective means of stopping a tratch that has already been put into the world.
Who's done with who?
Where and why?
You should not bind the information (or suspects) about the private life of your colleagues, if possible, to everyone!
And if someone opens up and tells us his inner secret, we should not abuse this trust!
The best one is to sweep like a grave instead of just not fixing the attendant, even if others know about the problems of the colleague.
Notified ill without reason?
If you are calling in the office to report illly as you call on painful headaches, because you just feel unwell, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one: your own work, unrecognised work, projects with fixed dates now needs to be done instead of yourself.
So don't play badly with the colleagues!
If you already know the morning that you will not get it to the office next day, or that something could happen, why you need to stay at home, you should report it in time, so that neither colleagues nor the boss will be faced with the absence in an unexpected way.
Summary, chicks, phones
You're just deepened in his work, but are you suddenly disturbed by the loud kicker of the colleagues?
I don't want to hear a phone conversation that you shouldn't have heard?
You should not nerve the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (which you lead over their heads), tramp, permanent shame or numbs.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not just deepened in a task (written, planned, organized).
Are the others always guilty?
If a project is not completed in time, you have forgotten to send an important letter or important news, you should not find the fault of your own forgettableness with others!
If possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
You better admit your mistakes and apologize if others were affected!
The question of how to remedy the error, or to retrieve the forsaken, is too appropriate!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Training suites and soaps: comfortable for home, but nothing lost in the office!
Not even then you should dress so hard if it would allow the job!
Do not become too slim - you should respect both your colleagues and yourself in a way that you dress in the office accordingly - if you want, also beautiful and elegant!
It wants to make everyone right - or how you will be uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of every morning.
From the radio a weird melodie comes: The sound of a geig, coupled with electronic effects.
I'm turning the volume up.
The pace is changing, to the sounds that have so far come the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar, who turns to Mr2.
The homely music scene hasn't just convened us with a qualitative electropop for a long time.
But now you even see the dust different when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting production from the home digital underground scene slowly contributes to a change in the overall image, and even if the garagenrock is again "in" with its guitar quit, the homely electropop proves: there are new things under the sun.
Baláz Zságer started in Pécs, musician himself in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a host house does not take two peppers - began to crawl his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which swallows elements from Jazz, Electronic, and Pop, but only when you were asked to compose the soundtrack to a film, he had been seen (e.g.
"Szezon" by Ferenc Török).
The formation, which had occurred at first in smaller clubs, was not known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" of the 2002's first album ranged under the top 50 home albums and Zagar, along with Yonderboi, was almost the only one, also marketable trendsetter in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band were "trendy", but nobody was interested if they would like to wear this brand.
The band has responded as it should: With a new, even better album.
The new album with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new ways to them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The term originates the time when Baláz Zságer was still on the way with another band.
The airy, flying play would be okay, but next to the etheric character of music, the - the time spirit and the trends corresponding - are the louder guitars, the influences of the Rock'n'Roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who is living in England, presented himself with the band "The Puzzle" at the premier in Millenáris.
A song from the album has even made it to the radio hiter - which since the newest from early to late pop music, Mr2 Petřfi sent to the hearers with the number "Wings of Love", which was recorded with six home singers ("underground Divas"), suczessively set the earworm.
All right, so (?).
The hvg.hu asked Baláz Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: In what way is your music reserved for a certain layer?
Baláz Zságer: The term "Schichtmusik" doesn't mean much to me.
I think there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be seen and non-sensitive, but it can also be produced only for sale that makes it to commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from a honest motive.
The listener's reception will also work independently according to this principle, languages and national borders.
Hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign audience of your music?
For example, in abroad, especially west of us, pop music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers or twens on concerts, but also the older audience.
They are following the trends in pop music that pass around them much more attentive because they also think it is part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Is it important who, where, how many hear your music?
For example: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
With us, the music does not appear to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the audience is mostly noticeable in the concerts where there is already a mutual interaction, but in turn only in the inadequate changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one thing I noticed: If you want to do it to everyone, you're no longer interesting.
Hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on his way as a solist and has built his career in the West.
For example: We don't really go his way, even rather than trying to interpret this again and again in our music.
We see ourselves rather as team players who trust in the musical presence of the other and let them develop.
At first, comparisons of our work were inevitable to Yonderboi, as several of us came out of his band and took another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of Mr2 Petřfi, "Wings of Love" stands first.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening conscious with a slightly popular style towards a wider audience?
For example, we did not have any plans to write a hit that then should be held as a train horse for the album.
This song is about more.
It was considered to be the final of the album with which we wanted to resolve the sound orgie and the slightly more difficult topics.
Hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why just she, what was the main principle?
For example, the basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of compiling the choir from talented solists of the homely music scene.
Thus the six-headed choir has been created - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikę Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then baptized later "underground Divas".
Hvg.hu: Would you like to have the song the same, or did the girls make it?
For example, the number was already in the instrumental version, but when the material was finished for the album, we thought that this number was still "needs".
The accord results have formally demanded a vocal voice.
I sang the melodie in the same night, later they learned the girls.
It was practically on hieb and terrifying spontaneous.
I remember that I was quite elektrified at that time, but it also needed the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never have become so strong.
Hvg.hu: Both on the plate and at the concert were the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from the short Solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, sing perfectly together and are not louder than the music, so their singing is not only accompanied by music.
They also stood back on the stage.
Is it intent?
B.Z.: The fact that they were standing behind was that way because of purely technical problems.
However, we did not consciously want to let them get solo rolls.
In the number it is also about forgetting his ego a little, forget who came from and where is on the way, we simply allow us to pick up these certain wings, the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state that we felt when the song was created.
Hvg.hu: What was the most exquisite song?
For example, in the musical creation work, nothing at all, it has rather been more difficult to mix.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert clave, or "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where the Groove was no longer working, but everything has joined itself as with a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
For example, this changes ongoing with the concerts and even now when I have the album "leave".
Now it's "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Deceptive makers risked billions because of feelings of minority
Non-bound fraud
This means his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French Bankenriese Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka.
Because she came about nearly five billion euros.
But it seems rather so that Ker much was just a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, and certainly wasn't incapable.
Unlike all large banking houses, he soon recognised the crisis on the American mortgage market.
"He's more mentally weak," was to hear from the mouth of his overseers who showed him at the police.
However, as explained by the French media, for example Le Monde, he was a man who had gained at the end of last year with his businesses at EUR 1.6 billion.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euro just at the American crisis.
The opportunity to do so was already delayed at the beginning of the year.
In February there were first news about that so-called sub-prime hypothecs, such as income weak customers or those who had previously had discount problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe that and kept right.
In the end of the year, he had grown up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"Already when I deserved the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain that," Ker admits and continues to say that he definitely hadn't kept anything for himself.
During all the interrogation, he admits that he has falsified documents so that he can't be seen.
He even managed to lead his chiefs behind the light, even though the Eurex stocks were gradually interested in his businesses.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly up?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the Bank."
Where did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He entered the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after he had completed his study at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $5,000.
After two years, he was already an agent of a maker and in 2005 he became an independent maker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never earn as much as others.
"Already at my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained to the investigators.
But soon after his entry, the first great success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by putting a half billion euros at the London bombing attacks on the loss of this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you make profit, let's leave you
"It's like a snowball," he said to the police.
But the chiefs said they knew everything, or they knew it.
"As long as I earned money, you closed your eyes."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the big hit came.
On one day he lost a billion euros.
On a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate for this.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that she had lost five billion euros for it.
And how did they come to him on the cheek?
He was suspected by a vacation.
"I took only four days of the previous year.
A maker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to watch him in the cards," Ker said a lot final.
Czech Republic has the chance to reach 365 billion
The Czech Ministers and representatives of the European Commission signed nine development programmes yesterday, which the Czech Republic can bring 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kroners) in the next few years.
It is about half of the sum that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the "Company and Innovation" programme.
Most money, about 150 billion, will flow into transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and includes up to 22 per cent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the Fund.
This money increases according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The 'Company and Innovation' programme aims to help entrepreneurs and companies to gain money to innovative businesses.
In this way, companies will gain finances for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more effective organisational methods.
In the past money acquisition from EU funds, Czech Republic is one of the least successful countries in the new accession countries.
Nicaraguanian Court confirms twenty-year penalty for ex-presidents
On Thursday, an appeal court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year sentence of the former president Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced for financial fraud in 2003 of $100 million (about $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he had been released from prison and lived under house arrest at his Hazienda at the Nicaragua Metropole.
Whether the former Head of State (1997 to 2002) is backing this Central American State, according to the news agency AP, is currently unclear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it will now depend on the prison officials whether to leave Alemán's punishment at home or whether he must be in prison.
A court stated four years ago that Alemán had regularly transferred money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest attendants.
Some of this money finally landed in a fund set up by Alemán to finance his election struggle in 2001.
Budgets
Yeah, it's done.
The State budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and which has been adopted without support for the opposition by the coalition majority.
The current year was still approved with the support of the ČSSD (Social Democrats) because he had presented Minister Sobotka (by this party) and the ČSSD could not reject him.
In contrast to the vibrant debate before the vote on the request for mistrust against the government did not happen dramatically this time.
The House of Members accepted this traditionally little respected, yet very important law in all peace.
That's paradox.
All government begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but is covered by the power struggle of the government and opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they give him more attention.
A conflict among politicians is much more interesting for the public than naughty numbers.
State budgets suffered from the last social-democratic governments under three weaknesses, which the 2008 budget cannot be removed at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure obliged by law, not only for pensions, but also for social expenditure, which has decided the "stilling" coalition of ČSSD and KSČM (communists) last year before the elections.
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the government budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat under control.
But a real time bomb is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many mayors, except for revenue from taxes, taxes and bank credits, used other sources of investment, often unreasonable liabilities, through which they excessively owed their councils.
In recent years, they managed to pay off these debts by massive sales of shares in the energy and other supply networks which they had received from the State in the course of privatisation.
Now this source is already sealed.
As far as we only keep on official and verifiable facts, we find that:
our economy has been through a growth phase for a few years, like the rest of the world, and the ČSSD is pronounced without resignation.
This represented a unique opportunity for their governments to fix public finances.
However, instead, these governments blamed the State even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a tremendous scandal that is primarily attributed to the former governments.
We are among the countries that are at least threatened by poverty at the global level.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes that have, unfortunately, been blown up in enormous size in the past few years.
Although it has succeeded in suspending a part of the unwise populistic expenditure adopted this year before elections, it is clear that if it does not happen to a shift in the retirement age and a pension reform, practically any policy in this country ends, and no matter who is in power, he will remain nothing as a pure manager.
It is only easy to overcome if one says that then it becomes officials from dominant politicians who mechanically divide the majority of tax revenues into pensions and social expenditure.
That is why this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but it can only prevent the persistence of normal expenditure by compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns for 2008 would be overflowing if previous governments had not spent over the past ten years, which was just going.
If we do not really want to make it possible to become pure administrative officials from dominant politicians, then we must be patient and not too strong coalition government, but we are aware that the State can spend as much as he can take on taxes and charges in order to want peace in preparing further reform laws.
Only these allow progressive implementation of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British Central Banks, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the crisis on the financial markets together.
This will bring more than $100 billion to the currency markets by means of auctions.
On these auctions, the banks increase interest rates to which they are willing to borrow each other.
For example, the American Fed sends $40 billion on auction, another 24 makes it loose for the European and Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time after the attacks of September 11 that the central banks of the individual States agree on such a coordinated approach to combating or remedying the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is to eliminate the greatest difficulties of the economy, i.e. the increasing lack of free capital that the banks can provide," wrote a report for its customers Bernard Baumohl from the Economic Outlook Group consulting company.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of recession in the United States from 65% to about 50%," added Baumohl in his report.
The banks have already lost $60 billion for unused loans, especially in the United States.
Analytics expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have really been afraid of what can be done when they decided to do so," said the Chefkonom of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, loans will also be more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and drop the American economy into a recession, perhaps with impact on economic growth throughout the world.
The central banks decided that after they had not managed to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the London Interbank interest rate used in money leasing between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to borrow one another money, although the central banks of the United States, Canada and the UK had reduced their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"This will have the same effect as another reduction of interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio by Tempus Consulting of the Reuters Agency.
Some analysts believe that this step contributes to the upheating of the crisis by central banks because it does not solve the basic problem, the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: The debates of the ecologists are incredible
Global climate change is supposed to harm developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the issue of global warming.
The criticism was now referring to the final international conference of the UN on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, no green planet", he concluded that the debates of the ecologists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only the structure of the conference is inappropriate, which constitutes a strange mix of government representatives and such non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric they accompanyed and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a wordfire that is only a replacement for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President emphasized in the presentation of his book that its topic was very important to him and that he therefore engaged in it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appears in German translation because "I often meet caricatures of my views."
So now interested ones could read his attitude uninspiredly.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climateologist, but he believed that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is academics who are able to understand and assess professional negotiations, have experience in statistics and are also national economies.
As the main statement of the book, he referred to the These that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, so that there is no consistent opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too serious and therefore no threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are excessive, effective and inappropriate.
In addition, he believes that it is a person who has experiences with totalitarian systems that is unacceptable to force others unvisited views, he considers this as a dangerous limitation of freedom.
He repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant eco-activists who do not take account of the relationship between effort and income."
Klaus had spoken about the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people couldn't exchange their licence
600000 car drivers failed the time limit to exchange their old driving licence, whose validity runs at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for exchange so that the authorities can make it possible to issue a new driving licence by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers go to the streets without valid driving permits.
According to the authorities, mainly those who have not exchanged their driving licence, who no longer want to drive.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of passports, the offices of the capital are overcast with applications and the interest in exchange grew this week.
The city administration completes around 2000 customers every day.
You have to stand up about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140000 car drivers have not changed their driving licence yet.
The exhibition takes a new driving licence for 20 days.
But it is possible to request the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, however, the driver has to pay 500 crowns.
Car drivers who do not create the required exchange until the end of the year and ride without a valid driving licence, threaten a penalty from January.
The wrongdoer pays a maximum of 2000 crowns.
But the police can also allow it to be used in the offense with a reminder.
In the case of a violation, the punishment can rise to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, the person from the municipality can also get a punishment that does not drive at all.
He could, said it, threaten a penalty of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry already called on the offices to give gentleness and at least punish a penalty of 1,000 crowns.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, said that no one threatens a thousand crown penalty.
The driving licence is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to have it.
It is not a personal certificate that everyone had to have a valid one.
People who don't want to drive should give their driving licence.
It is sufficient to bring him to the competent municipal office or to send him there by subscription.
On the end of the year, driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are invalid.
However, the drivers must gradually exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three years of time for exchange.
The validity of driving licences issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million further driving licences.
Court lowers penalties for detectives connected with Berdych
The former police officers Joseph Opava and Petr Kořařík, who are accused of having shared their business with the band of David Berdych, got 13 or 10 years in prison.
This was decided in a legal judgment by the Prague Oberlandesgericht, which reduced their penalty by two years or by two years.
Originally, the detectives of the "Amt for the fight against organized crime" threatened 14 or 12 years.
There is no prosecution against today's judgment, only a review at the Supreme Court is possible.
Although Berdych himself is accused of this matter, he is first proposing the first sentence.
In other processes, however, he had already received a total of 16 years of punishment.
Too much more, he can't be condemned.
In January 19 a District Court spoke guilty in particular of participation in robbery attacks, the Oberlandesgericht today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
The majority of the accused objected from the beginning to the accusation with the reason that it was a constructed case.
According to the Middle Bohemian District Court, members of the police submitted information from police sources to Berdych criminals, covered various robbery attacks and helped members of the band to withdraw from the criminal prosecution.
The band left Opava and Kořařík 30 percent of the beute for this purpose.
The accusation concerns crimes of the bands from 1999 to 2001.
Especially for robbery attacks, whose victims often suffered severe injuries, but also for official attacks and unauthorized weapons possession.
The police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
The band has enriched the accusation by its assaults by many million crowns.
Except for nearly 20 men in this procedure, the courts recognised Berdych and a number of others legally than guilty for further robbery attacks.
Other men from Berdych's circle must be responsible in another process, other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main negotiation has so far been deferred from Tomáš Pęta and Maroš Šulej, who are in Irish prison and are waiting for the final decision on their release for the prosecution of the Czech Republic.
Children exchanged - Invoice: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a retirement clinic, the lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand compensation from the hospital in Třebíč 12 million crowns plus court costs.
For each of the mothers every three million, for the fathers each two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent.
The hospital’s legal representative, Ondřej Dostál, is therefore entirely inconsistent with Velebas’s proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it lies a lot too high," said Dostál after today's negotiation.
"In order to make an opinion on this counter proposal, however, we need the opinion that the opposite side has been made.
We'll find out if it's absolutely worthwhile.
However, we believe that this should be in the hundreds of thousands of people together," stressed Dostál.
The amount was to move between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At first, the family from Jablo _ov wanted a million crowns every month she had not raised her biological daughter.
Veleba served as a basis for compensation negotiations, which had prepared for him the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children believed that experts from psychology and psychiatry suffered psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depth.
The men experienced the stress situation better, even if they saw suspicions against them that they could have prevented the reflux of the newborns.
In turn, women are dealing with the consequences of the experienced dream, as well as with what is currently going on, Veleba gathered the contents together.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged hospital nurses in Třebíč on December 9, last year.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablo
The district head of Vysočina (Böhmisch-Maraschian height) delivered 100 000 crowns at the end of October of each family as a replacement for expenses that were created by the hospital in Třebič, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law for liability.
In doubt, they need to reach a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can request assistance to the institution.
Until now, the courts have added relatively low amounts of damage to those concerned, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, except millions.
Polivka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the struggle about the "Kingdom Walachei" brand.
According to the judge at the Ostrava District Court, he first used the term "Walachian King", but the project had built a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor in a long-term work.
Polivka did not participate in the negotiation today.
According to his lawyer, the matter is probably not finished, and his client will probably commit a call.
"The struggle is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívka's parasitary," said after the negotiation of Polívkas' lawyer.
Everyone, at the words "Walachian Kingdom", just presented this actor and competitor.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money purchase and concepts of activities," he said.
According to him, the occasion is a fight for money.
"After years, they have noticed that the project is successful and that they could also have something of it.
They want to win parasitary at our work," he continued.
Locate business
According to the court, Polívka used the name "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television broadcasts.
In 1993, the actress Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him.
However, this was not then associated with the intention of founding a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the idea of exhibiting walatic passports.
A business and an entrepreneurial activity were crystalized from an initially enjoyed action, and Harabiš then joined the foundation of the company "Walachisches Königreich".
In 1997, Polívka accepted the use of his name and signature in the passes and even offered its owners reductions when visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also claimed today that Harabiš used only the mere idea that Polívka published in the "Manege" mission for his entrepreneurial intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has helped the project of the Welsh Kingdom safely," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team were who had dedicated themselves to him intensely.
The cooperation of today's controversial parties took place until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized the official crown for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, between Polívka and Harabiš began to raise the disputes that were elected in the "King Boleslavs I. until the Sankt Nimmerlein's Day".
The leadership then claimed Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a queen mother.
In 2002, Polívka enriched the complaint against Harabiš and his company that the court rejected today.
Clearness in the dispute could bring the race prepared by Harabiš around the throne and half a princess.
A new king should come out of that.
Details and a date he didn't want to betray yet.
"We don't want to hurry.
It should be like the king's relocation in the Walachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Mr Polívka is also able to log in,” Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing from the front
To say the truth, I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving properties were not much worthwhile, the quality of the gang switching, the steering and also the processing could be described as rather under average.
But now his successor, the Peugeot 207, is on the market, and he is much better.
The combi with the name SW is another piece further, and I just remain to revise my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the too low head freedom on the backers' seats.
These complaints are no longer available, because the combi caroserie is designed so that not even two meters of men will suffer.
Fast Continue
I'm just going through the internal equipment in order not to repeat myself too much.
It is a very successful design, where I have objections only because of the careful middle tunnel.
Then I would welcome some more design, where the car otherwise makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and over the times when we may complain about short seats or head supports.
The side content has also significantly improved compared to the 206.
As far as the room supply is concerned, you can also feel the magnified dimensions of the caroserie.
In the combi, the lack of head-free has also been eliminated.
Bag in the bag room
The main cause of this car is the charging room.
I must describe it (also due to the relapsable rear window) as very well loadable and space-saving.
The hole rooms are equipped with holding belts that represent an ideal compromise.
They don't interfere, get apart, and keep more difficult things.
But let's talk about the load volume.
It is according to table in the basic equipment 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, not compared to the most sold vehicle of this class in Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
When we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the Peugeot remains significantly noticeable 52 litres.
This value is already critical for a foreign vacation or when you invite a child car.
But in order to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the very flat charging room or the very low load edges after the rear seat.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder petrol engine with a Hubraum 1.6 litre and a power of 88 kWp.
And honestly, that's how a 1600-cubic engine should look that drives a family hatchback.
He's silent, has a low consumption and moves well.
If I compare him with his counterpart with Škoda, which sometimes works as if his outpuff was stuck with a laptop, then I can only be enthusiastic of him.
The price list speaks bands
The price of this car is not just national.
We must remember, however, that we have tested a well-equipped car with a spacious inside and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1300th petrol engine of 329900 crowns is still on.
With our engine, it costs 410900 crowns, which is already quite much.
The equipment Premium of the test car hits again with 80000 crowns in addition to book.
However, we had head-airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic disk-washing dissolution, electric window lifts back and...
This costs the car totally 531900 crowns.
That's a lot, but you'll count on the additional equipment of a fabia and you'll arrive at a very similar sum.
So only the decision is still what mark you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students in British schools is not successful
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern Europe increases, which inherent concerns for the further development of local schools.
The integration of the East Europeans has so far entailed a number of obstacles.
British schools even determine cases where conflicts between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe to British schools illustrates the case of North Kent, where the conflicts between local and Slovak immigrants are gradually rising.
Discussions, scenarios and raising among pupils have been transferred to the relationship between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had hit a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended the boy's insulting her with racist insults.
The police also had to attack a Slovak immigrant after a attack of two minor girls.
The girls had claimed to make racist comments to the man and cast him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus cabin and pissed on us.
When I told him he was to stop, he cast us with apples and bears and then bleed his seat," described another unpleasant incident from the newspaper The Times, a mother of Slovak students.
complaints come from both sides.
One of the locals even referred to the struggle with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The cases mentioned testify that the mood between locals and immigrants at British schools becomes increasingly excited.
In the UK, 70,000 Slovaks have been reported to come here for work search.
Accordingly, some 30000 Slovak students visit British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really a island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, that will be fulfilled if you only select the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and All Inclusive with cellners that offer on the beach Pizza, ice and delicious cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you can find this in an excessive degree.
Only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was its bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen a human eye.
Havanna once became a camp or transit camp of treasures that the Spanish had robbed in America and then transported to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The Hotel Nacional was created at the end of the 20th century.
Construction made it to one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered crime in the United States (especially during the prohibition), was liked to be seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high houses grew, across the wide Boulevards, cars, which were among the cult symbols of the fifty years of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havannas, and in Cojimar he had his hunt.
At the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio stars of the show business and politician from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
At the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails for you according to your wish.
And the cult cars of the fifty are driving around in Havana until today, because the once imported skigulis and fiats have long been cut apart in the salty and wet air.
Mag Havana, especially his oldest part, has fallen strongly down, nowhere is found as many wonderful colonial attractions in the surroundings as right here.
Other places are just punched out, for example Trinidad.
In order to ensure that tourism brings urgently needed money, there was green light for this development.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have been created not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another marotte that is unique in the world and is primarily attractive to railway lovers.
The sugar tube from remote planttages brought dust and diesel-driven narrow trails to the sugar plants.
Their riding park has not been renewed for decades, and so you can see brilliant and fully functioning locomotives, whose older companions are in the museum for a long time.
Excursion targets
The most important places do not leave the majority of the visitors of Cuba.
So you don't have to write in detail about Varadero or Havana.
Just keep mentioning that in the site of Hemingways mentioned above, there is a museum whose visit should not be avoided by the one who likes this writer.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba.
The pleasant vegetation grows on calcium soils.
The Mogotas, calky hills and fingles, hook up steep from the valley floor, gathered fruitful soil in their holes, which also covers tightly grown rock areas.
This valley is where maybe the best Cuban tobacco is built.
In its final form you can meet on him if you visit one of the Havana cigarettes factory.
It may also seem interesting for some that there was the Chilean episode of the "Major Zeman" series.
Trinidad
An ancient city, which was founded shortly after the Spanish colonization of the island.
Ruhm and riches brought her the trade with slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied in the decorative beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a so remote place that there was no road that would have connected the area with the rest of the country in the fifty years of the last century.
This isolation helped to avoid it.
Nothing was built there, but that's why nothing ripped off, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, it is worth looking at interesting places in the area, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the "Tal of Sugar Manufactures".
In the evening, you should go to the Casa de la Música, who live after the darkness, and where the music is not silent until the morning.
Baracoa
This town all in the east of Cuba calls some the most beautiful of the island.
This view is certainly also influenced by the way.
Both roads that lead from Guantánamo must overcome high and crushed mountains and run through a landscape that is hardly touched by human interventions.
These eastern preposts of Cuba included the UNESCO in its World Heritage Directory thanks to the unaffected nature there.
There is the best chocolate produced, the church shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it was created about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current hotel El Castillo, is seen several table mountains of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the room, the cigarettes, the Sierra-Maestra mountains, the pig book and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patriarch Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the offspring of slaves confess, can be written on many pages.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, claiming Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, influence the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO should, according to the words of Minister Robert Gates, develop a concrete plan for the next few years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not run according to its ideas, the representatives of the countries who have stationed units in the south of the country were agreed on this in the Scottish Edinburgh.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban, the eight participating States also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, by their Deputy Minister Robert Gates, called the NATO units for more activity, the UK sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan Government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan there is a progressive development, but military force can only be a part of the solution.
Another part is to allow the inhabitants to start even the development of economic and security," says British Des Browne Minister of BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the American army, the activities of the Afghanists have reached the highest level for five years.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 percent compared to the previous year, even by 60 percent in the southern province of Helmand.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter in the southern territory.
According to the United States, the alliances have reached an absolute limit on the organization and equipment of the units.
Concretely, they require further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about the specific goals for the next time and the way we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly today, the Secretary-General of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop, expressed itself.
"I am not pleased about what we have available in Afghanistan to land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we needed, and that is too little," said De Hoop of the Agency Reuters to conclude three-day discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months, there has also been conflicts among the countries involved in whether all all all the allies in Afghanistan are doing their best.
For example, because of passivity, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fight requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," said Gates.
This week the British Boulevard magazine "Sun" referred to the German soldiers as faulpels.
"Afghanian non-studio distorns: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a contribution complemented by photos of German soldiers, playing table tennis.
The German image newspaper went over to the counter attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a Rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debts will be speeded up to a billion in 2009
In each Czech Republic there is a government debt of 84,000 crowns.
The total debt increased to SEK 842.7 billion by the end of September.
The government had planned to blame itself this year with 159,2 billion women.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the improved development of the state budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion.
By the end of September, the Czech Republic’s government debts increased to SEK 842.7 billion.
As a result, within the first nine months of this year, they increased by 40.2 billion.
However, since June, they dropped by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its information on state debts from early October.
In every Czech Republic there is a debt of 84,000 crowns.
Over the last year, the state was debted by more than 111 billion crowns.
"To now it seems that thanks to the lower deficit for the next year, we may exceed the limit of a billion crowns until 2009.
Next year the debts should move between 900 billion and a billion crowns," said David Marek, analytic of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, Analytics of the Next Finance: "We could come through the course of 2009 by crossing a billion.
When exactly, depends on the next budget we don't know yet.
If the situation on the political stage is to change and the politicians should be ready to save more, this could take place until 2010.
But I don't go out of such a change," he noticed.
Growing debts
State debt is the result of the government's debts and comes mainly from the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
State debt is financed by tax instructions, public debt contracts, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic government debt increased this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's foreign debts now increased by 1.7 billion kroners to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion since June.
The average rate of state debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how good the economy is.
It is interesting that the growth is primarily related to debt statements, where growth is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debts rise, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented the data.
Better than expected
The financing strategy and the management of government debts for 2007 shows that the government had planned to take up 159.2 billion kroners for this year.
At the beginning of December, however, thanks to the improved development of the state budgetary policy, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount is particularly affected by the government budget deficit, which is apparently going to reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the estimated 91.3 billion.
It is also a maximum planned appropriation for the Consolidation Agency of 13.3 billion kroners, a 10 billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of state debt contracts for 43 billion and a rate for loans at the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
For giving a name to a Teddy Bearer, she was brought to a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, accused in Sudan for the infringement of Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a court in Khartoum on Thursday evening.
The British was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to give the name Mahomet to a Teddy Bear, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would've deserved to be pissed out.
After parents of pupils complained several times at the Sudanese Ministry of Cultus, the 54-year-old primary teacher, who was working at the Unity High School of Khartoum, was taken home at Sunday and accused of infringement of Islam in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code.
In fact, this matter takes her beginning in September, when the teacher invites her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classenteddy.
The children suggest eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reports school director Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 out of 23 children choose Mohammed as the favorite first names.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature My name is Mohammed.
The bear itself had no sign with that name, but the problem is quite simple that the representation of the Islamic prophet is considered to be insulting Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues in Gillian Gibbons, who teaches the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew them well and she had never done anything that could have brought her close to religious faith, I regret only that she asked the children to vote for a name, his view is that it is only an innocent mistake.
One opinion that many students share the teacher's students who are very attentive to their students and as a person who never describes religion in the class.
It is noted that the first name Mohammed is also the second most frequently given second name in Britain, for which there are 14 different writings in English.
This pre-name, often chosen by Muslim families, is considered to be a kind of honor to the prophets (he is often given to the firstborn of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this pre-name?
For example, can he be given a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday there was no agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
At the end of the failure
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo have completed a sixth and last discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is unfortunate that the parties could not agree on the status , said the European intermediate Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Its American counterpart, Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina, called for peace in the region to fulfil their commitments to maintain peace, and continued the discussions beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violent acts are expected in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite clear tensions.
End of the concessions on 10 December
The intermediaries of the Troika, which unite the European Union, the United States and Russia, will meet last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the Province of 90% of Albanian speakers could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, have been the sixth and last negotiating session since the Troika last August received the order of the UN for a new conveyor.
Americans and Europeans are expecting their mediation mission to end on 10 December.
The Russians who have already blocked the granting of Kosovo's independence at the Security Council are going to continue the negotiations beyond that end date.
Russia was and remains speaker of a negotiated solution, a convenient solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Unilateral Independence Declaration?
After the Kosovo has been under the management of the UN for eight years, western countries consider the independence under the EU's supervision as the only solution with the future.
Pristina is willing to announce these one-sided if the Security Council should not decide to favour them.
Belgrade is based on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the president of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held on the last opportunity since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Cosovarian Rebellion and future Prime Minister of the Province, shared its regrets.
He added, however , that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations .
Domino Effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic, on the other hand, believed that a compromise was always seeking and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly a "domino-effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation stressed that any decision was made only alone in the Security Council, where its Russian allies have a veto right.
The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision from the series of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, explained the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations took two years.
You have to end as they started: in the Security Council.
The journalists answered Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status and added that every unilateral declaration of independence will run from the Albanian people in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush opens up an agreement between Israeli and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which had been gathered on Tuesday under his leadership in Annapolis, Maryland, President Bush announced that Israeli and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He further explained that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to start negotiations immediately to find a final arrangement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy terrorist infrastructures and Israel must stop its colonization work, explained Bush, reminding the two parties of their commitments with regard to the roadmap for the peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authority under the end of Abbas aimed at a peace treaty, which is intended to clarify all open questions without exception, including the central issues .
This name covers the three serious problems that primarily concern the disputes between Israeli and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees, which were displaced from their home in the present state of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
After the American President, Abbas took the word and stressed that the next negotiations are conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provides a system for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the word on the other hand, he committed himself to conducting the coming weapons resistance negotiations directly and without interruption and to try to end them before the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states , a Palestinian and an Israeli who stands next to each other , for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that Bush has received a assurance in this sense from Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis represents a great success for Washington, has led one plan taken by all Arab countries into the ways that Israel offers peace, in exchange with its withdrawal from all Arab areas occupied during the war of 1967, including eastern Jerusalem.
Annapolis represents a skiing path in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central faces, the Saudi-Arabic Prince in his interview with the Arabian daily newspaper financed by Saudi money.
The lawyer believes that the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumours are opposite.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigations by the National disciplinary authority of the police (IGPN), a police car on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday, just after 17 o'clock.
He had no effort, but was on strip, and went with 40-50 km/h, without blue light, explains a spokesman of the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without authorisation, so not released for public road traffic (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, with a very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after it had ignored his precursor from the right, one policeman continued.
The alcohol control carried out on the vehicle passengers is very negative.
The condition of the car (profit wing, split wind protection discs, ripped stove) indicates the intensity of the collapse.
Very quickly, last morning, the state lawyer of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry announced that she had trusted the IGPN in the "Facts of the involuntary personnel murder and the lack of assistance to persons in danger", in agreement with the main public security guide of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the lawyer explained that she was exploring the IGPN at this stage excluded the police's responsibility.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident that were listened to Sunday evening have confirmed the version of the police, namely that this little power wheel has reached her left side relatively quickly.
Last night, a kind of rilling, certainly caused by the mobing of the footnails on the ground, showed that the two vehicles had remained hocked in each other until the police were able to brake.
The vehicles have been deployed and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The same names of the two victims were postponed yesterday.
What happened afterwards?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the round, so the police would have left the place of accident very fast, and that without helping the two youths.
Although the IGPN remains very cautious, it would also exclude this issue regarding any serious errors.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations that are necessary for further investigations and which must be very careful.
Liberation has met a eyewitness of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows he had direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cosine, the nurse in the hospital, to try to experience her again, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely disturbed policeman who hanged.
Two others tried to experience one of the youths who phoned the fourth.
In view of the excitement rapidly foreshadowed and, as it appears, due to the certainty of the people present about the unhooped situation of the youths, the police were taken into the car by colleagues who had arrived at the accident site.
According to this testimony, the rescue forces encountered about twenty minutes after the police went away.
They also used heart massages, but for nothing.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police forces wouldn't have helped young people.
The first help has been given to these young people.
The firearm has arrived immediately.
It was done all to try to save her, stressed the state lawyer on the other hand.
In Pakistan, the tension increases
On Monday, the Pakistanian police took down the first demonstrations since two days earlier, called General Musharraf of the emergency.
According to witness statements, in the city of Lahore in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who demonstrated the measures taken in the framework of the emergency had been violated by the tear gasgranates that used the order forces there.
They threw them with stones with which they hurt the police.
At least 350 lawyers were temporarily arrested.
Similar scenarios were in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen attacked and injured lawyers.
Several would have been temporarily arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about 500 arrests of opposition officers, defenders of human rights and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning the roads leading to the Supreme Court were locked to prevent the congregation.
Further demonstrations would have been found in Multan (mean) and Peshawar (Nord-East).
On Monday, the lawyer movement received the support of the religious parties united in the mighty Alliance of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose President urged the people to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the emergency, and to those who have put an oath before Musharraf.
Musharraf's promise no longer applies
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a position in direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was dismissed and discharged.
All the things we represent are illegal, anti-constitutional and opposed to the decisions of the Supreme Court, said the Magistratess of The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to declare the supreme command over the army and to become a civil president no longer is valid since the call of the emergency, said on Monday by the Vice Minister for Information Tariq Azeem.
It was expected that he would deliver his military uniform until 15 November, the date on which his first term of office ends as President.
The Vice Minister for Information also confirmed that the elections could be postponed from January.
In addition, the Pakistani government pointed out the rumours that were hardly held in the country, according to which President Musharraf had been assigned to a place of residence by his constituent leader.
More than one third of pregnancy is still not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Newwirth Law, which allowed contraception in France, one of three pregnancys (36%) is not planned, as shown by a study by the National Institute for Demographical Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancy (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseen births.
Ined estimates that the different methods of contraception such as the pills or the spirals still have a failure rate of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which finds that the percentage of pillar users between 20 and 40 years using pills has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, liberalisation of contraception has still enabled better control of fertility.
At least eight of ten births are nowadays carefully planned.
For one of five couples, even exactly calculated on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season, in which it seems the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the room station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his companions from the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) will have taken more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective sun collector, which is indispensable for continuing scientific work at the station.
A watched outturn, which, due to its duration, the removal of inhabitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools designed by the astronauts to perform the repair, has achieved several records.
The problem occurred on Wednesday when the astronauts had discharged the Harmony Module from the space ferry Discovery, a large cylinder form, which will soon take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratory.
This module is a type of landing bridge for the module laboratory.
But you have to be able to provide them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to implement a 17.5 tonne heavy module for the generation of electricity over sun collectors already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After relocating it, the crew made up the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module whose range is 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors who can grow up like accordones was damaged by a cable tailed on a length of about one meter.
The restructuring has been stopped in order not to damage the collektor anymore.
The astronauts who originally left the space ferry discovery for a control and then repaired another sunballer whose rotation system was incorrect, saw themselves forced to devote themselves to the damaged collektor.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around the end of the 30 meters long-controlled arms of space ferries that had been placed at the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA's best space whalers.
Large, resistant, very skilled, he has a well-developed upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old doctor was selected to operate the injured suncollector .
After careful consideration of the damage, he separated the defective cable and fixed a kind of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second space whaler who stayed near the sleeve, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the crew.
The tool that he used to prevent an electrical hit, a mini-Hockey hit, reconstructed with isolator, to the sun collectors, who produce several hundred volts, had thought and straped the astronauts on board the station.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited until the collektor was fully folded up before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half day of relaxation before today seven astronauts returned to the space ferry Discovery to expect the return to Earth on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned at the stock exchange
After the air navigation and defence group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros in order to counter the residuals of the A400M, the EADS share is currently showing a significant decline in the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to reassess its 2007 business forecasts with reference to the residues caused by the slowly advanced development of the A400M engine which delay the flying of the plane.
The costs announced in October to compensate the delay in the delivery of their military aircraft amounted to EUR 1.2 to 1.4 billion, of which more than one billion for Airbus, announced by the EADS mother group of the European manufacturer.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 in the presentation of its quarterly results, without further details.
The group also indicates that the assessment of the new costs is linked to the six-month residue.
To remember, the business performance of the EADS has fallen from 86% in 2006, significantly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, the very large carrier aircraft A380.
Originally, the group had planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of status Quo
On Sunday, it will not be exciting when the urns are being interpreted: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's Party, United Russia.
After a very locked electoral struggle, she confirms its pursuit of stability, even of authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, the Russian President, Wladimir Putin, addresses a message on public broadcasters to the voters who have already been recorded, but whose content is kept secret.
He does this in his character as the leading candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Creml party, for which a overwhelming victory announces itself.
Last night, the President did not have anything to look through when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was pleased to deliver a new attack point against the Western powers accused of the interference – his favorite theme during the election struggle.
We know the prize of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the opposition's view, they've lost themselves there.
She prevails a electoral struggle that is polluted by oppression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, the ex-shake world champion Garry Kasparovder has been sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer's ban on visiting.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of the Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without excitement, two very further questions are raised:
Who will take Putin's success as President?
The Official Journal announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections on 2 March 2008; the candidates have time to announce themselves until 23 December.
Since he was elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Wladimir Putin is unable to act for a third mandate.
And now there is no follower.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
President of Parliament's majority and the Almighty Party of United Russia, which will choose government and President?
Whatever it will be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidency elections, the power of which has been in the past will triumph.
That's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not the Lord of their fate, says the sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes even further: The civil society has only progressed very slowly in this country, which has been christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
According to the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has reconnected with the model of a paternalistic state, which was fully accepted by the population, even more, since this new paternalism did not follow terror, but a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman says of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians, out of free pieces, reject the personal responsibility they have shown shortly after the U.S.SR's destruction.
Why do you think about it for a long time?
This phenomenon concerns all society layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands the status of Quo: 65 governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) lead the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equal to chaos, as in the 1990s.
The generality prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not also vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion by Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: What do you think about for a long time?
Those who are in power aren't so bad, why do they dissolve?
A Hard Memorial
After they have been treated confidentially for more than 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, who document the destiny of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely accessible.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which have been placed in Bad Arolsen on a total length of 27 km, could not be seen until now, unless with a humanitarian intention, i.e. individual and name-related, that is, on request of a former victim or his family.
The eleven States responsible for their administration, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed in May 2006 to make them accessible to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process of this Decision has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heikle Information
The access of the historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the inmates of concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, explains Reto Meistern, head of this archive, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to make these namely documents available to the public, due to the vicious nature of certain information.
Like, for example, the claimed homosexuality or the spiritual disability of some deportation sacrifices.
The prisoners of the concentration camps or the arrest orders issued by the Gestapo had been gathered for a practical reason after the war: civilians who had been deported or subjected to forced work, to find them, and perhaps to provide them a proof of their arrest in order to bring them the way to their compensation.
Today, in Bad Arolsen more than 300 festival employees are still processing tens of thousands of personal requests.
Nevertheless, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
There is nothing to expect fundamentally new in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Center for Antisemitism of the Technical University of Berlin, 2006.
The EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently, mutual trade between India and Europe is already at EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is the most important trading partner in India and represents 18% of its external trade.
European Minister for Commerce Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, indicated that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's Ministers for Foreign Affairs had given the European Commission green light last April to open negotiations, with a view to signing free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is the first trading partner of India and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the nineth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will greatly promote the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe forms the first or second market for the ten most exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued. Asian and European gigants exchange annually of goods worth EUR 47 billion and services worth EUR 10 billion, this week Daniéle Smadja, Chairman of the European Commission's decree in New Delhi, explained and regrets that mutual trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India meet their eightth diplomatic in New Delhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barrosso will be present on Friday.

The Bank of England takes note of the concern and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about reducing the current recursive concern about the credit conditions and announced an offer of 10 billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offering with unusual duration.
In order to weaken the fears that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly difficult at the end of the year and to give the banks a greater assurance about the way in which they will organise their liquidity positions at this time, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its savings during the maintenance phase, which begins on 6 December, in the form of an open market operation for five weeks , it indicates in a communication.
The Bank continues to explain that 10 billion pounds (EUR 14 billion) will be circulated in this way on 6 December at 12.15 GMT (EUR 14 billion), to the basic rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE brings liquidities in an open-market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its communication, the BoE adds that it is willing to take further measures to obtain the different interest rates of interbanking loans with its basic interest rate from day to day.
The interbank interest rate varied from day to day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has been paid to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in summer, the sums brought by the Bank of England were linked to criminal charges that had prevented the banks from taking advantage of them.
According to certain rumours, increased by the development of the pound rate in contrast to the euro, many prefer to sign for the sums in circulation by the European Central Bank to more advantageous interest rates and with safer discretion
UMP and NC refuse to review the PS proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist Legislative for Purchasing power, which corresponds to the refusal of the text.
The text produced by a socialist nische (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) indicated about ten measures adopted on Wednesday by the National Committee of the PS, of which the majority of 50% for the employment allowance, for the re-establishment of the TIPP fleeting, for a transport check or for the limitation of rents.
After the UMP and NC had voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which provided partly vigorous exchanges of words between majority and opposition, several hours before the television contribution of Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchase power.
The leader of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault Members announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the legislative project for the correction of the finances, which was examined last week by the Assamblee.
A new festival is born
As a result of numerous rumours about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promoter/Producer announced the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in cooperation with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no more and no less, served as an example for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones communicated from C3 on Bilboard.com.
C3 organises the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping vacation.
The festival will probably take place from August 8 to August on a 500 acres large private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The leader of the Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most renowned festival producers.
In 1989 he took the leadership of the United Kingdom’s Reading Festival, which attracts about 80,000 people every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added his portfolio to Leeds Festival, and then, 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of the production of the license concessions and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now take up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones from C3, the Glastonbury describes as the most inspiring event he's ever attended, says that his company and Melvin Benn's work together to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and work zealously with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We had negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained in police debates regarding the current administration, Charlie Jones continues.
"Happy we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are taking preparations to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will eventually benefit the population."
C3 Presents has resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 in the Grand Park Chicago after it has been profiled in 2002 with Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
The two events were able to achieve $9.8 million in 2007 and $11.8 million in gross tax revenues.
These two festivals take place in urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, while the weirds rather take place on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to merge these two concepts in some way, in order to at the same time communicate the impression of a rural festival in the European and a urban way in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Community of Vineland, including the Mayor, takes on the burden of this event with pleasures," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to give up the conditions of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to take up a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the recording capacity of the festival is "very large" in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations have been sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the top Independent Promoter Prize of the last Ballboard Touring Award, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
Not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no one is more impressive than the Terminator.
These lock attempts are part of the delegates' tasks.
A political "heikles mandate" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, inspires Runaway Productions.
Is it difficult to negotiate with the "Gouvernator"?
"You must be careful, because it is the industry that decides where to go.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer the best ones," he says.
The run on the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, the pre-existing of the cinema is at the moment top priority.
The hunting for the Oscars started.
At all festivals at the West Coast, although that of Sundance, which is from Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about to present the movies from Quebec, evaluate them and ensure that the producers give interviews.
The dark age had a successful idea on the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented in January at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented on the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Are the stocks ahead of an end-year rally? Ineensity among experts due to the US hypothec crisis
With just five weeks up to the end of the year on the stock market, investors are already pushing their hands in terms of the coming end-year rally.
Nevertheless, experts cannot create safe forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that purely statistically viewed, the month of December on the stock is usually associated with a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to create forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics. Especially if serious tensions determine the current market event
Although other experts do not approve such a strong increase in the course during the last weeks of the year, they note that the stock exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant, which, due to the lack of safe share funds, is mainly invested in pension funds, which are highly affected by the upward trend of assets to be generated.
As a result, these experts believe that the stocks will have a rather postal, market fluctuation influenced curstrend, especially because we are not yet able to estimate the extents of the possible fall in the US notes bank interest, an uncertainty which is mainly due to the increase in the raw oil price and the danger of the increase in inflation rate.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the Sales Department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a watching time to announce a forthcoming market rally.
The chances are not very good, assures the expert.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost a value of 4% since its maximum brand on 8 November of 15.945,7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, Analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully finish the year with nearly 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the Investment Funds and the traditional grant of the pension fund every year.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasizes that this year things could develop something different, especially due to the end-year rally already in the second December week, and then directly after the bridge day of the Constitution.
The analyst considers that price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, Analyst at the Bank Inversis, the previous assessments on the market situation are at a nearly technical level, which could lead to a deviation of the index values, which depends on the consequences of the US hypothecist crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When choosing the values to drive the Ibex to new maximums, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney proves that this year's big values are on the row.
The expert would include the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
However, Federico Olucha is assured by the Bank Inversis that the increases in the bank and industry will be associated.
If the Rally actually occurs, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In recent months, the ACPs were on the retirement course and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same way, according to the expert.
As regards the increased consumption behaviour during Christmas, market events will be determined in the last half of the periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technologies will also achieve positive turnover results, even if they are only in a small number in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, the December only showed declined courses in two cases.
When at the end of 2003 the technology blast was placed, this led the stocks from their crisis and at the same time initiated the last real end year rally.
This year, in which Ibex 35 picked up 28.17 percentage points, the December showed an increase of 6.68%.
Whether the fifth winning year in 2008 (the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and can also show a final year rally will be shown.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of his branches.
A total of 200 of them are located in the most economically strong regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these establishments mean a large milestone.
But also for the rest of the Spanish institutions, since Popular as the first banking group is awaiting the jump to extend the opening hours of its branches to 20.30h on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The Banking Group BBVA, which also repeatedly reads the extension of its opening hours in the establishments, has not yet taken any definitive decision.
The current negotiations of the Bank with the trade unions seem to aim at an agreement, which concludes 75% of all branches on Saturday and opens for it on a weekend afternoon, although not for the customer.
Whether further banks join the new initiative adapting to business opening hours will depend on the experiences of the Popular Bank.
And that's the intention of the Popular with her project.
The aim is to extend the opening times of those branches, which, due to their situation, can acquire the purchasing customership of independent, small and medium-sized companies, but also those of large purchase houses.
The Bank wants to open the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not new, but altered opening times.
For this purpose, the Bank will transform the spaces of the establishments already located in business zones and at the same time compare the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus, the extension of the opening times is linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more current, coloured design.
The competent bank representative Ángel Rivera assured that the restructuring did not require larger investments, but involved an increased staff institution, since a branch now required eight or nine employees.
The establishments, which will even be equipped with additional spaces for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested his concept on nine branches in Madrid.
And the values of experience were positive, says Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O ́Donell and Gran Vía have been selected for what seemed to have been a wise decision.
Popular is currently conducting around 2500 establishments.
And another 60 who operate under the name Mundocredit. They are specialized in immigrants and also show extended opening times, even on sunny and celebrated days.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them will offer a wide selection of non-financial services for sale instead.
We do not want to compete for our customers, explains Rivero.
With phoneica, they have provisionally agreed to sell mobile phones using external bank staff.
The Spanish private sender Telecinco doubles its stock value for the first time and thus overcomes his rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this phrase, the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, announced his satisfaction at the end of the stock. The sender led by him had increased his value by the double of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, weakened his joy: that is exactly what hurts me; not that we had a higher growth, but that we had less losses, he found.
He stressed that despite the weak market they have not fallen too deep.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15,66%.
According to Bloomberg, the company value now reaches EUR 4.488.88 million, while mediaset controls the main share of capital (52%), and Vocento is only involved with 13%.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40,5% since January, making its market value up to half by 2.193.46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other stock-noted communication companies increases; in the case of Sogecable to 3.571 million, in Prisa (User of the Cinco Días magazine) to 2.518.53 million and in Vocento to 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it is two similar companies, so Vasile.
Uncertainly, the question still appears to be what extent we can actually operate stock technology, at what price and how we can make it luxurious at customer level.
Telecinco explained his project this year to increase to the first television broadcaster with more than 1,000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. This insured Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group's advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenue by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, the net turnover increased by 1.6% in the first nine stockings months (up to 734.4 million), while net income from television business could only increase 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for the better stocking history of Telecinco is to see the analysts at the high payout ratio that the company could show up to the present date: In 2006, the company led by Alejandro Echevarría was a 100-percent dividend discharge.
Vasile, however, assures that after buying 33% of the shares of endmol, with mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it was too early for an official announcement.
We are obliged to pay out at least 50% of the shares of the official compromise, even if we have ever given much more.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose shares we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the endmol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently showing some loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced his profit calculation in Telecinco by 4% for this year and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the decrease in expected growth rate, which will decrease from 10,5% in 2008 to 8.4% and in 2009 from 5.5% to 5.1%.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 by 4.5% for 2008 and 7.5% for 2009.
3 Options.
1.
Ibersecurities: puts on its high efficiency and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measured Telecinco (purchase) due to the multiple incentives and the prospering market a more beneficial position than Antena 3 (keep).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends reimbursing expectations in both cases due to similar threats (saturated market and worse economic climate)
The Convention agrees with the MIFID directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary preparation, which today, with the Congress Decision in the Senate on the supplementary/amendment applications associated with the project, the government published the provisions resulting from the new law with the intention to allow the entry into force of both regulations until the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congress and Senate Members who had pursued the aim in their negotiations and votes to set up the best possible regulation that guarantees the security of investors and regulates individual entrepreneurial activities in order to ensure a generally efficient market event.
In addition to the modernisation of the financial markets, the MIFID, which sets up the Securities Service Regulation, pursues an improvement in investor protection, the increase in the demand for control of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables specialised firms as well as natural or legal persons to provide financial advice and also contributes to the establishment of new financial service companies (ESIS) to the consulting companies that are associated with investment and mediation companies of securities.
It also extends the number of financial transaction systems so that the regulated circulation markets will be added to the multilateral system of the effect business and the systems for internationalisation of trade contracts, which would finally compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment companies to announce the focuses of their company profile, confrontation and the forms of handling risks on the market and to register all projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV’s control task.
Afterwards, the Congress's Economic Commission proposed further changes, with the decision that, due to its high level of risk for the investor, the debt obligation provided with titles has now been to be considered as complex financial resources, confirmed by the US hypothecist and banking crisis. (US-Hypothec crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the Directive on the legal limitation of the working fields of diplomatic scientists was used; 30 years after 1977 the regulation which restricted the working areas reserved for economic scientists was adopted.
The Senate, on the other hand, established new positions in the financial sector how the economic mediator, who works on foreign account, cannot need authorization from the CNMV and at the same time offer its services to commercialise products and customer gains for several investment companies.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) has increased by five tenths in November and is now 4.5%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to evaluate the inflation rate within the European Union provides the average price development in Spain in November.
Its publication is in line with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which are aimed at a local and quality comparison with US products by the disclosure of the data.
The forecast for the indicator can be established in advance by applying the same method as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information that is not available at the time of the calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) suggested that the prematurely established indicator should only serve as a target value and therefore not comply with the final result announced on the next 14 December.
Consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Vice-President of the Government and the Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs, Pedro Solbes , the increase in the VPI was a temporary development in November ; at the same time , it assured that the price index would remain at a relatively high level in the coming months .
Nevertheless, Solbes in the halls of the Congress Building noted that even if the present number is not good , Spain's inflation difference to the other members of the monetary union remained more or less equal in recent years .
In addition, he stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of about 4%, announced by the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs with regard to the forecast published today.
Virgin calculated with Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros over the next three years
The value of Northern Rock has decreased by more than half after the Bank in the mid-September of the last year had asked the British Notenbank for an emergency credit and now only EUR 12,000 million (equivalent to EUR 16,800 million).
At that time, the bank's assets amounted recorded 25,000 million pounds, a sum that has decreased significantly by the customer's loss of confidence within two and a half months and also despite the government's 100 percent guarantee that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis will continue to fall.
The company Virgin, which would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, has to buy about a quarter of the income of the British banks, which will be composed of the plants of the next three years, in order to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their target of 30 billion.
The group of multi-millionary Richard Branson, known as his prominent advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to flow 50,000 million pounds (equivalent to around EUR 70 million) annually in advertising and marketing campaigns to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock named this week the Virgin Group, in which three more companies are involved, as his preferred bidder to lead it out of the insolvency.
The mayor of Totana arrested because of suspicious suspicion of participation in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of the village of Totano (Partido Popular) of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of demolition in urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the head of the municipal police was arrested.
José Martínez Andreo last May represented the Office of Juan Morales, currently Member of the Partido Popular and at the time of the City Council of Totana, and could, according to information from the broadcaster Cadena SER, be the original wire trainer of the complot.
The officials continue to examine the business documents of the municipality and the Ministry of Urban Planning and do not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer was accused of Juan Morales, the principal suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to information from the Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular and therefore privileged Member Juan Morales was arrested in the absence of his client's residence due to important burdenful documents that are to be related to the complot.
In addition, other sources of information report from the supposed order payments of morals to a Galician construction company, which provided for the conclusion of a urban contract in which the construction of a 200 hectares large area was decided.
Eight people are currently in investigation.
Bono agrees to adopt the candidate of the PSOE in Toledo and the case of an election victory at the Congress.
The former Defense Minister José Bono has adopted the offer of the President-General and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and is therefore going to launch the list of PSOE candidates at the next General Elections in Toledo and, in the case of a Socialist Victory, take the office of the Congress President.
Thus, José Blanco, the PSOE Organization Secretary, and Bono announced a meeting with Zapatero at the press conference, after today at the party's headquarters.
The Head of Government believes that the offer to the former Minister is justified, as it is important in politics to be able to count on the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, in the case of a victory for the socialists, the politician from Mancha would seem to be the president of the Congress for the party at the coming elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Congress President, who had announced in the last 15 November that he would no longer join the next general elections, quit his career in public policy and instead engage in the university area of climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that the President-in-Office had continued his return to political events since his retirement two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that, like the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to abstain from the citizens who would take over the posts of the Congress President in the event of a victory of election and called this as an act of transparency .
If he should actually take the office, he hopes to transform the chamber into a house of respect and not the infringement or cries to make it appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, one wins the impression that the only place in which you cannot speak quietly and let alone in Madrid is the convention; so the government president in the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and said that he would not seem to have taken the office, since otherwise his political opponents would call it an arrogant.
Climate propagation
Since climate debates are subject to both the skeptics of climate change as well as those who focus on a social and political debate in this regard, it is necessary to show a strong cohesion of movement as a whole.
Especially if it is a leader of movement, who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
This proposal, however, brings it in an explanation of the action or non-commerce of its government, which has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain is at the top of the countries that have at least fulfilled the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are the responsible for non-compliance with the requirements, which sectors are due to this and why his government, which had proposed the Treaty with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, he has now been forced to present the Spanish citizens the measures it has planned to combat climate change without any change.
Which companies will be affected by changing the behaviour of the citizens, the individual and collective savings measures and the economic consequences.
More precisely, who has to sacrifice and pay for the salvation of the planet.
However, there is and will not be any such statements in the future.
Just because it's about sacrifice and paying.
Because the measures that can be effectively applied against climate change are unwanted.
They are costly, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the gasoline centre proposed by the PSOE, Zapatero appeared to be so dangerous in a strategic way that he was forced to withdraw the proposal again.
Thus it is now necessary to save the planets with nothing, i.e. with pure propaganda and empty proverbs without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, the Commission, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its contracts with the planet, the politician, otherwise suitable for election campaigns, must neither speak, accuse, nor demand, but rather follow the demanding issue, decorate the meetings and enthusiasm with his mildness and kindness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not vary from its pure virtual nature and therefore does not presume that the bicycle will be the only means of moving in the future or we should only refresh ourselves with one vessel.
The Mayor and Head of Police of Totana due to a presumptuous involvement in urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of Murcia's town Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo. Furthermore, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office and a hotel entrepreneur, because of the suspicious suspicion of urban breaches, it was said today from research circles.
The city council was arrested at his residence, from where he was taken to the municipal office and where he is located until the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who were also encountered in the urban administration and in the municipal construction management of Suelo Industrial y Vivienda.
The three arrests are related to the findings already taken on Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where more than 2 million hectares of uncovered construction for urban construction projects under the direction of the Galician construction company Nuaria, which should be built on the property 4000 apartments after the local administration reads illegal provisions during the last legislatural period.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested but undergone a investigation procedure which is initiated and carried out by the first Court of First Instance of Totona.
The first six arrested persons have been presented to the Judge today.
According to research circles, the former Mayor of Totana and current independent PP member of Juan Morales is also identified.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, owner of a property company registered in Totana, as well as his current friend who remains in Murcia, is suspected.
The chairman and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as the manager of Suelo de Inmonuar Pablo José M.G. whose companies were to have acted as a subgroup of Nuaria and had to receive the smurry money.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban delicts, under the supervision of the Central Unit of Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, had eleven further investigations, most of them in companies directly related to arrests in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the holder of a regionally well-known poultry farm that should have acted as a middle man.
The Nuaria building group was commissioned to build the largest living complex of Murcia's village, which should include more than 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
The company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometres of area in Totana, which was to rebuild. The aim was to achieve a construction project, which would increase the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar that promote the sale of real estates; Conyase, which in Vigo operates the parking sites of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the Plaza Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the sector of direct marketing and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of components.
Things that can happen
1.
If you agree with this, we will turn away from the expression Book of the month and instead try to find a price-name of other names with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course, you are warmly invited to make your suggestions.

Our Finnish correspondent explains the comment published yesterday in the main Finnish newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, (Finnland is on the top of the PISA Study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; on the day of which the issue contained the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the field of philosophy has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy about the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murders is an abiturant who quoted the works of Platon and Nietzsches in his news.
In an interview of Helsingin Sanomat, the Chairman of the Educational Council for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, urged teachers to take a more critical position towards Platon and proposed to remove Platon's teaching from the sub-learning plans for the PhD Philosophy of Gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads into the criminal law:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of law, which was dealt with with six months of prison.
But once again, if you rob a music business under a value of 400 euros, this is only considered as a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the thief is considered to be criminal, yet the punishment falls less than at a download (Article 234 criminal law).
C. If you closure a car and give it back forty hours later, then the punishment is still smaller than when you download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fighter than in a music data exchange.
Participation in a rebellious conflict is a penalty of three to 12 months afterwards (Article 154 of the Criminal Act), while data exchanges result in a reduction of freedom from six months to up to two years.
(Article 270 of the criminal law).
E. Article 184(2) of the Criminal Law Book considers sexual harassment at work to be less serious than downloading a DVD movie from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films whose authorization has not taken place by the authors is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film materials to minors (Article 186).
Well, so if my colleague should be right, then someone's demands are pretty high.

My home doctor passes me one of his long, weird research articles with the title: money leads to activating certain brain areas, especially when others get more of it.
So the feelings resulting from the monthly pay are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was produced using a tomographical-magnetic reference analysis at Bonn University, and the results were published in the last issue of Science magazine.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Hirn Research Center Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave correct answers and failed his companion.
The researchers were able to realize that the brain activity was always very moderate when both participants were right with their response and then also received the same salary; but if one of them received the double, there was also a stronger brain activity.
I am not quite sure whether it really takes so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Lawyer from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been following the criminals of the Balkan wars for eight years. Her office is located in the state prosecutorship of the Criminal Court of the former Yugoslavia, resident in La Haya.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and laughing eye, as the principal responsible for the massacre of Srebrenica - the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims killed - the ex-General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic are still on the free foot.
Their names are on the list that the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as a template for the title of his documentary films La List de Carla (2006, not yet run in Spain); a film that, with the speed of a police thriller, pursues the Swiss state lawyer from Belgrade to New York in her project to detect the escaped criminals and puts the respective governments under pressure so that they can cut their networks closer.
What insurance is best suited for me?
The CFZ insurance covering a possible damage caused by the driver includes a high cost charge, which depends on different factors, including age, gender, time of drawing the driving licence, family status, type of car to be insured and use, etc.
It's only the beginning to own a car.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the correct vehicle model.
First of all, you must be clear about what we have to do with here.
A car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance undertaking.
This agreement shall be recorded in writing by means of a insurance contract which establishes that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is, in turn, obliged to present the corresponding amount of depreciation in case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of insurance composed of several factors, including age, gender, date of drawing the licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or used.
Insurance companies shall determine their prices in accordance with statistics so that higher contribution payments will be paid in the event of a higher accident risk.
For this reason, both over the age of 25 and women must make less contribution payments, as statistics show that these groups have a lower rate of accidents due to their caution.
The same applies to married persons, since they, according to the statistical values and therefore also by the company's conviction, tend to have fewer accidents as those alone.
The benefit of the vehicle affects the frequency of driving and thus the probability of an accident.
The more frequent the use, the more likely the damage.
In order to set up the premium, insurance must take into account a number of points.
For this reason, the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the car insurance that meets his personal needs.
We are now listing the most important points that should be considered in the selection of insurance in order not only to make a performance but also a price-oriented choice.
The under 25-year-olds meet many obstacles, such as low driving practices and young driving licences, when choosing a price-effective insurance.
Even if it would be best for an ideal insurance protection to complete full cash insurance, there are still more affordable alternatives.
The cautious drivers can select a full casco with self-interest, so that the services of a full cash insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer has to pay a part of the amount resulting from the damage itself.
The amount shall be fixed before the contract is concluded and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, Spain’s principal representative at First Europe, an intermediary company for online insurance.
Another option is the extended insurance that insures customers against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by their own car.
In addition, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
When you are less than 25 years old, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; this increases your credit by trying to drive cautiously and avoid accidents.
A credit is a reduction in the basic rate of the corresponding insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in tariffs mentioned.
The amount of credits and penalty payments depends on the company and its revenue.
If the company has a profitable year behind it can allow to increase the bonus payments , explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is that with increasing driving practice, the accident rate decreases.
Thus it is most useful to decide for a full cash insurance with self-participation.
Usually, young people cannot benefit from their experience in the past, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, the Spanish leader of the European company explains and adds that the majority of the accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginning.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to complete a full cash insurance; of course only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
The insurers are considered to be married couples with children as customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, full cash insurance with self-participation (a amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. If you have received a high credit, an extended insurance is recommended, which is not used until the third year of the vehicle.
They totally drive relaxed and have a larger purchase power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera establishes.
For pensioners it is possible to complete a full cash insurance with self-participation (a amount of EUR 150) or an extended insurance which is only used in the case of a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, we must note that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage, but also because it is high costs that require a thorough selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan on the point for the Achtelfinale
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will be fighting for the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals before completion of the Champions League pre-runde. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while deciding on their participation in the shots.
The Italian team already has five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with a distinguishing in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs another one to ensure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not collect the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as the FC Milan has to arrive at the FIFA Club World Championship in Japan, where he will fight for the first time in the 13th halffinal for the entry into the final, which takes place on the 16th.
Thus, this group will be completed before all others and the distinguishing in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadion to the all-side expected result, even if both teams will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home the Keltik Glasgow knows that they would have a better starting position in the eight-finale in the case of a victory grouper.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even reach a defeat at a floppy of the FC Shakhtar. Nevertheless, it should not be too much trusted in such circumstances, because at nine points, the Ukrainers are allowed to participate; they had lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but could win the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milan will try to hire the shots the evening. They hope to reach the eight-final of the transformed Champions League for the second time after they were conquered in the previous game season in exactly the same round by a gate of kaka in the replay time (1-0) and by a zero to zero distinguishing on the replay.
While the FC Shakhtar is waiting for the victory of the Rosseri, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the Achtelfinale as well as its membership at the UEFA depends on its victory and a defeat of Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European mastership, the Benfica Lisbon could reach the third place by a victory and thus participate in the UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In the Canadian Vancouver, the Spice Girls gave in the eyes of 20,000 spectators the start shot for their first tour after the resolution of the band in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the start of her concert at the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium that they were excellent in the reunited band.
About the 20,000 people were able to experience the concert in the out-sold stadium, in which a video of the story of the band, which had taken care of furries at the end of the nineties, was shown.
The reunification and world tours are surrounded by the publication of a new album, which includes its largest hits and two other new songs, headlines and voodoo, which appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore on the stage golden armbands that had previously given them the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fan masses in the audience that brought the GM Palace to glow, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden it in the days ahead.
During the preparations for the Schow, Victoria Beckham told us that the British Star hadn't seen our garderobe once, and so I'm already excited what he's gonna think of the appearance.
Sporty Spice , whose withdrawal from the Group in 1998 due to internal differences in the group's resolution two years later, expressed their nervosity two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed that the feelings had changed to the spice girls.
And that's why I didn't think, so I'm glad that I made this decision, Chisholm expressed himself to the separation of the band that she had made nine years ago.
The singer also made the statement that the disputes were removed and now all like themselves very much again.
Nevertheless, many things have changed since the last common appearance of the Spice Girls in 1998.
First, the group arrived in a special engine from the Virgin Airlines in Vancouver, according to the television broadcaster CTV.
When they arrived at the airport, the band was received by a army of children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will appear next in California, in San José (Dec 4th December) and in Los Angeles (fifth and 7th December).
In Madrid, they will enter the stage on 23 December.
New fears of gas conflict between Russia and Ukraine
A new price struggle between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe will be affected.
Most of the Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and every conflict between the two nations is very closely observed.
Kiew warned that if Moscow raises the price it has to pay for the gas, it will take account of higher transit charges from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two countries last year reduced supply to the EU countries.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time when the Ukrainian Government and the Russian state gas monopol Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine has to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine needs to be calculated more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for the import of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in discussions," said the Ukraine economic minister Anatoli Chinakh of the Reuters News Agency.
"The changing gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges [to West Europe] across Ukraine."
In January 2006, Gazprom reduced supplies to Ukraine in the last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which led to a drastic increase in prices.
Russian gas is a quarter of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas in the world, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "must control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service must improve the control of pre-strafe registers for workers outside Europe, said one member of the control body outside.
The recommendation of the principal financial controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland had been brought in conjunction with the attack on the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed concerns that the Scottish State Health Service did not have any precise ideas about the number of its foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller examined staff recruited outside the countries of the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, a Iraqian doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a land car was driven through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transfer in October in Old Bailey and was burdened in connection with the suspected autobomb attack in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service should carry out checks in advance of the appointment of foreign employees to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorizations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities use Disclosure Scotland to review pre- penalty registers, the Agency does not have the power to obtain these information outside the UK.
In addition to other recommendations, the main auditor's report now states that the Board of Directors should adopt guidelines for the exclusion of criminal registers to help employers in controls in different countries.
"Because we found in some staff documents evidence of these checks, these were not routinely carried out."
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation directives with a high degree before hiring, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that precise information on the number of foreign health professionals is available."
BMA Scotland Chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely" that investigations in front of the appointment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could deal with future terrorist attacks.
"The report says that the NHS Scotland's current preliminary tests are working well and it is not clear which added value the recommendations will be provided," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1.161 foreign employees, most of which doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number was likely to be higher, also because the authorities had problems identifying those employees who were admitted at undefinite time.
The investigation continued that established control procedures by NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lotian have been mainly observed.
These include passport, work permit controls and qualification controls.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policies and guidelines for checks prior to the start of employment for foreign staff in the NHS.
The Secretary for Health, Nicola Sturgeon, said, "It was a concern for me to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that, in connection with the health authorities, the Scottish Government would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on the control investigations were planned next month in advance of the appointment of all employees, including those from abroad.
Joy Division dominates film price rental
Control, film biography over the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis has invented five prizes at the British Independent Film festival games, including for the best film.
Prizes were also made to Chief Competitioner Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and awarded the accompanyer Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded as the best chief writer for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond writer Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for bringing the British film into the world public.
The prices were delivered in a ceremony in the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis ascension with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 with 23 years.
The black and white film - on whose soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order are to be found - has been rotated for only 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he has introduced two prices to the Dutch photographer Corbijn, which has been most well known for the cultive cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, as the best director and the best government debut.
Rock music was the center of another prizemaker at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film over the Clash singer Joe Strummer received the price for the best documentary film.
The prize for the best performer went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a Russian mafiabosse in David Cronenbergs, London, who played Thriller Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, who is in the reputation to play hard guys, has picked up the Richard Harris price for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, whose films are Scum, Nil by Mouth and Sexy Biest, currently films the Indiana Jones Continue The Kingdom of the Chrystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud of getting the prize called to honor the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I had the luck to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my kind of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film prices, known as bifas, are selected by a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia because of a terrorist complex
Saoedi Arabia discovered yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants because of their belonging to cells, who had planned an incoming attack on an oil plant as well as on clergy and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathists of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been a union of the United States since 2003, as a result of the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, quoted by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the television report.
Saudi Arabia has set up a 35,000 men strong fast invasion troop to protect plants after an accidental Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the arrested ones belonged to a cell led by a "rakete expert" who illegally immigrated into the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
According to the report, another 22 of the prisoners had proposed to kill clergy and security forces.
The government warned clergy to do more to stop Saudis, who seeks Iraq to associate with Al Qaida Milizen, who want to fight the allied forces and the US-supported Shitian Muslim government, which is considered to be a ceterian by the Hardliners under the Sunnian Saudis.
Al Qaida Milizen considers many clergymen in Saudi Arabia in cooperation with the authorities in support of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militia - accompanied by calls by Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaida leader born in Saudi Arabia, targeted it to the prowest Saudi government - has looked at foreign residential areas, government buildings and plants of the energy sector.
"This was a very great effort for the security forces over the last... five months," said a spokesman of the Ministry of Interior to the state television.
The arrests also included a "mediation cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed at advertising "Takfiri thinking" - the ideology of radical Sunnitic Muslims, which supports violence against Muslims, which are marketed as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the arrested, 32 people were accused of providing financial assistance to the military.
The climate on Venus could show a view of the future of the earth
The Venus may once have been a pleasant place to live, said scientists yesterday.
Data from a European spaceship located on a cycle show that the planet is even more similar to a turning twin of the earth than was ever conscious.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planetal paths, but the Venus of the Sun is something closer.
Millions of years ago, the Venus had ruled conditions that would have been very similar to those on earth and could even be inhabitable, scientists today believe.
However, due to the unbreakable carbon dioxide engine effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by sunlighting and a slower rotation rate, Venus encountered a very different development course.
Today, the planet is robbed by water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is destroyed by hurricane-stare winds and lightning storms.
The knowledge of the Venus Express space zone of the European Space Agency, which has examined the plants for one year, provides an enthusiastic view of how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express Mission, said: "It is clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that of the earth, while the planets are otherwise quite similar."
"Our new data enables us to create a scenario in which the Venus has started billions of years ago like the earth, perhaps with a living environment."
"Enriched Uran" convicted by the police
A kilo radioactive material, reports of richer uranium, was beaten yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police speaker said that three people were arrested and that the material is being checked.
He did not confirm whether it was a richer uranium, but he said it could have been sold for $1 million ($480,000).
Everything still open
My Romey said he did not think it worthy of a presidential candidate to be consulted by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally declared himself willing to take up a debate on YouTube, take questions on video in the normal voters to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday, November 28, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the Democrats asked about global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected exactly the state of the Republican Party, which breaks up in the elections next year.
It is not known exactly as the producers of CNN who supported the debate with the candidates to show youTube clips.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was longest dedicated to one subject, immigration was at the heart.
The subject is one of the most decisive topics for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecisive voters to use a electoral disc when they heard things that pleased them: The television institute noticed tops of consent when the candidates talked strictly about the limits.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who moved forward in the decisive surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation that he was nasty about illegal immigration when he was Mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts to set illegal immigrants for work at his house.
The two were particularly seriously distinguished as a questionnaire whether one of the candidates would support an "Amnestie" (the illegals would give a regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
Unambiguous candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian Congress Member, and Tom Tancredo, a Congress member from Colorado, were able to hack this topic.
None of the two men have serious chances of nomination, but both stay in the race, perhaps because they've been on the immigration puzzle earlier and harder than others.
At least in the field of immigration, candidates share in general the same views: sharper limits, intolerance to illegal migrants.
This topic, along with anxiety about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps the Republicans to forget or minimise the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic than other topics have been addressed.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinking should be considered to be a torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led to Giuliani’s view that although the Bible is his preferred book, he may not literally believe the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations on the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-term Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was insisted on whether Jesus would approve it, he laughed about it and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains extremely open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Paul's recent donations and his coincidence storms in the debate of Wednesday.
These two have been shot up from nothing because the two wings of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the more famous and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has from the beginning united the party with a victorious message about the size of America and a whinker to both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far unclear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another grube to fall in; his way out of this is the same.
For British skandales, this is not particularly tricky.
No adventure titles seem to be sold, not paying any politicians of Paris's hotel bills, not having been sucked out of marriage.
But the discovery that a rich businessman has swept donations for the British employing Labour Party over more than $650,000 ($1.3 million) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to report this is something without that of the contested Gordon Brown.
When the Prime Minister had withdrawn the demand for a election two months ago, foolishly insulting the intelligence of the British by claiming that opinions had not influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the more and more vicious representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, has developed the once feared Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The unsubmitted rescue of Northern Rock, a occupied bank, showed regulative weaknesses and poor judgments under shock.
Badly thought proposals to amend tax laws have brought business associations against the government.
The taxable loss of personal data from 25 million people revealed unpredictable administrative pfuceries.
A trio of generals in retirement started a rebellion in the upper house from protest against reductions in military expenditure: to be the minister of armies, they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the various donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labour Secretary-General (and her former executive leader) has already retired.
Nothing of that means that Brown breaks up unrepentantly in the direction of departure.
Nonetheless, governments can reach a turning point where they feel impossible to rule.
Neither do people trust politicians, but they usually refrain from being skeptical when a new army takes the office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a Prime Minister improves the situation, and he does not even need to be involved for a long time, this excess is over: public service is not beginning to be done; the cabinet ministers begin to plead; the press is looking for bad news; and the government will be defensive and unsatisfactory.
In some way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because, in contrast to other political leaders, he cannot claim to be a new one.
If he would like to deny Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the taxpaying documents, for example, are linked to decisions made by Brown as the Minister of Finance.
And even if he was not directly involved in Blair's misleading - as in the long "penal for adventure" investigation of political party financing - the voters may assume that he was.
Still, Brown's situation is not as bad as she looks
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, nobody died, or was totally swallowed.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver off what Brown's naturally promised stalinistic tendencies: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new wedding for political donations is a good example.
The garboean Abraham who compares his donations with his non-profit gifts, he does not wish public recognition for his goodwill.
Maybe that's the way, but the decision did not allow him.
The laws against anonymity for large political donors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who rule the country.
Watt, he said he knew about Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask himself some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's principal financial driver, who was told about the extraordinary donations in October.
But until now Brown is not involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew of these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his official adoption in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he watered this determination by gripping after a well-known instrument to address an investigation committee - in order to complete the measure, by a bishop in a retirement and a judge.
In this case, the "doctrines to draw out" are not very complicated.
When the law has been breached, it's a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do as to find a permanent chairman of the Independent Committee on Standards in public life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and to progress with a comprehensive reform of political party financing.
This would be required by the hardliners of the labour force to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party partner like Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in the opinions; he has two years to recover voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is by unattachable righteousness and solid competence.
Card shark
Does the credit crisis enable America's credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it is only natural that back flosses are screwed up.
Now that America's real estate market is violating, the robbery has the credit card market of the country in the Visier.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs expect that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of underfinanced loans spreads to other forms of consumer credits.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases both in the bookings and in the seasonal rates that measure the proportion of loans that are not invokable or more than 30 days late.
The HSBC announced last month that it took a $1.4 billion charge collection from its American consumer financing, partly due to the weakness of credit card operators.
It's still too early to panic.
Loss and dreams are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third-quartal expansion rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point below the historical average.
The worsening of the Councils can be explained partly by technical factors.
A change in the US private insolvency laws in 2005 led to a sudden case of bankruptcy applications, which, in turn, account for a large part of the loss of chain cards; the number of registrations (and thus seasonal charges) would rise again whether the general conditions for creditors are worse or not.
The industry also reports of solid payment rates that show how much consumers pay off their debts each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standing in other corners of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research company, calculates that the output volumes for 2007 will finally be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infectious channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are certainly: it is more likely that consumers take credit card debts, now that home credits are drying out.
However, the card exhibitors look at the cash flow instead of capital values, so falling domestic prices do not necessarily solve a change in the creditor's credit value.
You can even be advantageous for the card exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue paying the hypocritical rates fall if the real estate is less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts become more important under the return priorities.
Card exhibitors can also respond much faster and more flexible than creditors to the more stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid re-evaluation of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and review the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones' main financial reference.
Even if a sudden coverage crisis is unlikely in the credit card market, the risks of a sustainable decline are significantly more real.
If lower house prices and a reduction in credit are pushing America into the recession, the industry will undoubtedly face a more cruel future.
Keep them looking out for these sharks.
British bankers confess guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be brought before court for their role in the fraudulent system with the former head of Finance of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their request on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally occupied innocently for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for the supposed conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000, in order to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was initiated on January.
But during a hearing before the court before the US District Judge Ewing Werlein Junior, everyone accused of a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during two years of delivery procedures.
In the United States, their case is a loose end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The original accusations submitted against them in 2002 made it clear that Fastow was the aim of an investigation of the government in connection with Enron defeat.
The accusation against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to eliminate a fraudulent complot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Koper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron's partnership, controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of countless fraudulent Enron-makeships, who contributed to breaking the company into the bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had estimated its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it actually had a significant value.
A company under Copper's control acquired the bank's shares in the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid heads $250,000 for participation in this company.
According to the charge, Fastow falsely claimed to Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the $20 million went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, Copper, and other $12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, Fastow announced himself guilty in two conspiracy points for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow puts a six-year prison sentence in the Louisiana Federal Prison.
Copper is putting a penalty of three years and a month in a facility in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was on the free foot on the basis of a $1 million assurance that required them to live in the United States in expectation of the court proceedings.
Enron, once the seventh largest company of the nation, broke up in the bankruptcy in December 2001, after years of accounting tricks no longer allowed the billions of debts or weakening businesses to appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron Founder Kenneth Lay and former Chairman Jeffrey Skilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Skilling has a penalty of more than 24 years.
Lay's sentences for conspiracy, fraud and other accusations were annulled after he died last year for heart disease.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of a plane of the Gulfstream G550 brand, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But this is little money for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Fire, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you ask for so many seats because it is for a private family or a company president."
Fire was at the Gulfstream stand on the last Friday at the millionary exhibition, a four-day orgie of a viewed consumption, which was organized in a decorated exhibition centre at the city edge of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxurious exhibitions had built up, hoping to interest newly arrived Russians in everything, from Mahagoni-dicked yachts to diamond-crossed cargrills, which would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Four carefully took a shiny orange porcelain at the next fair stand to the Visier.
"This is a nice car, but it's small money compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil tree, the Russian capital seems to be flooded with money like Dallas at its glory times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came into gigantic wealth and went to Europe in crowds where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and European studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab overflighters of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians appear as the most visible free-good money publishers in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share in the golden rust.
Anotherwhere in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, Chairman of LVMH, moved to exchange ideas about how to sell high-quality products on markets such as Russia.
(The Conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars in total, according to the Forbes list of richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, which is worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005 15,8 percent of the Russians lived under the minimum existence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - so we are all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jewelry.
She had for the first time visited the fair with the Russian trader of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all exemplary cared, and the men are all worth a wealth."
While they take Sunday night in evening clothes through the halls, two real estate makers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, themselves and their clients describe themselves as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the designer dress that she was wearing, like a Red Teppich-Veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily to target the new ranges, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be ready to stand in the dust for several hours to visit a congenital storage house, which was decoratedly Cadillac Escalades, pocketmesser from Platin, Mövenpick Eiskrem, customized billiardtic, appartments in Dubai and Gund Teddyberen next to each other.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, the patriotic at a fair stand of the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before a wall-size imitat of a rembrandt image of hand-painted, blue mosaic stones.
"Surely, Russians are more interested in Klimper climbing."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of naughty brands with limited numbers that would not be marketed in a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousands of people, whether millionary, messengers of millionaires or simply tourists pushed through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil beds, said here, he had sold two 70,000 dollars of mattresses made of silk, casmire and cotton, with innate goldweeds.
Also in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company equipped high-end cars with high-end alarm systems that his company sold the grellan orange porch for $170,000 to a Russian millionary.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, a company that adapts luxury cars to customer wishes, said that he had sold three car cooler grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which matches related chain arm bands, for $5,000 each.
He showed a reporter a car mature developed for a Russian casino owner with spikes that he had overwhelmed with colorful Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a roulette.
The costs: $22,000 for a four rate.
"The Russian millionary, the radiant wheels or a picture of his wife's face from cubic circonium will not necessarily drive on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will store it in his 30 or 40-wave garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russia millionaires" would not express much exclusiveity at the moment, given the increase in the domestic real estate prices.
"If you bought a house in Moscow three or four years ago, they are probably already millionaires, at least on the paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as if they were rich in a state operated by Alliance Continental, a Russian assets management company.
The company had set up four red phone cells according to British model, which were fully stopped with mountains of false million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false banknotes for the millionary fairs.
Passengers persuaded to throw the money groups around, mobile phone photographs, while rejecting themselves in the midst of the replacement wealth, kniping from friends, or simply putting in a few millions.
"See, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Suspicious surgery suspected by death in New Jersey
It was the day before the crop festival as Ronald Livingston saw through the big glass window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant here and watched a car on the white Cape Cod two doors further down the West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car there.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the car arrived by the physician body viewer," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"This was the point when I knew someone had died."
The hearings learned that the dead lady Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the Newarc Police Dec.
Now, the mediators try to find out if she died for a procedure that was carried out by an unauthorised cosmetic surgeon that the police did not identify, and who worked in the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet detected what caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will be helped to explain a mysterious death that has sent a grief through the headquarters of the Newark Police.
Mrs. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and hard-nailing," said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarkian police officer who worked for the alcohol control mission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for the state prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that Ermittlers would try to find out whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorised surgery.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the House at about 3 a.m. in the afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead in place.
More than one week has passed and the authorities have notified much about their investigation or the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say whether Mrs Castro was asked by the authorities.
The mediators try to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a perplexed pink is in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatine is calling behind the house.
A blue faze described with "Ethyl vanillin" - used as a replacement for vanilla in food and parfums - sat in the parking area next to a door that led to the undercover.
Two mountain bikes hanged from hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark for the first time after he spent 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him work in the provincial and tough political culture in his new city.
"She said, "You have to pay attention to this or that," he said.
"She was always here when I arrived here and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing."
Hope that the central bank will reduce interest rates to increase world share markets
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after market hopes that the Central Bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest reductions, strengthened by significant comments by the Vice-President of the US Central Bank.
The stock markets increased in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, President of the Central Bank, said that the policy "flexible and pragmatic" should respond to the persistent pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm treacherous markets, given signs of exciting loan tensions, Kohn said that the recent turbulences had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from late September and October".
If the increased turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were taken by investors as a signal that the central bank is willing to enter into the US markets with new capital injections and to stabilize the credit conditions with possible further interest reductions.
The statements also helped to calm the Wall Street, given further bad news from the US economy, now that the sales of US-Immobilies reached a new record depth in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were emphasized by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4% of their worldwide employees, in a cost reduction measure to compensate severe losses from their lost bets in the US hypothec credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these posts will disappear in London, where the Bank is working 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close at 13.289,40, while the wide-ranging S&P 500 index increased by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 per cent to close at 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
In the past, reappearance of credit pressure on the markets had been underlined after a strong demand for auction of three-month guarantees granted to the European Central Banks, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the U.S. Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and feed more capital into the Money Markets in London increased when the loan voltages saw the three-month "Libor" Councils for borrowing between UK Banks with 6.59 percent to their highest increase since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England confronts with a decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of them almost as difficult as the other.
Who's going to be a number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the chairman of the election, is here at least on call under this special title, to help chief trainer Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan decide on it, and because the table of High Morries, the English business leader, is gradually filled with applications for national voters, if not even for those in part time.
Anyone who does not get the sixth fighter position will be unhappy, but life is often unjust and sport is no doubt.
It's never easy to nail exactly what allows a person to reach the top of his professions, while someone else never gets beyond the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of happiness instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult where judgments are needed that are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leaderships with good conclusions that know the business, should be transported.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player unless it is given him the opportunity to swim or go down.
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decisions, but opportunities have this too.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time if he can take a wrinkle and a fighter must get regular opportunities on order if he wants to impress as a single cricket player.
catching the eyes of the selector is more complicated.
There were many who were better during the last season than James Anderson, who seemed to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explains himself healthy and how the wind conceals in the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class Wickets with each 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for more.
Whether Shah or Bopara plays at the Asgiriya Stadium, it can only be one question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, with five Wickets and 40 useful runs, but Paul Collingwood was still struggling to fasten himself, who made the break to a significant test cricket player and who, although he pointed a double hundred against Australia, might still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion during today's network session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and abdominal feelings for Shah's greater experience about Bopara's young enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his splendid and valuable 88 test debut innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22 years, and an excellent balance against rotated balls.
But Shah only made ten runs in his two innings in May against West Indies in the test in Lord, his home Arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection of the selectors as Vaughan was healthy to take his position back for the next game, seems to have taken the swing from his hit that was still obvious in Bombay.
On the other hand, the all-canner from Essex has sculptural joy in life.
He was not impressed by anything on a cricket site and his position off of it was brought to the point when recently he had overwhelmed a vehicle with four-rad drive in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out his Vodaphone (of course also sponsored) and call his teammates Alastair Cook, who had observed this from the distance, and say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he conceals his medium speed with some effect here on the fields that seem to fit him and strikes with confidence and skill.
To choose the right man is one thing to choose the right time to choose another.
Maybe this is the actual art of selection.
I tend to give Bopara now his chance, which doesn't mean that Shah may not stand well when, as the tea set from Ceylon suggests, he's the one who will play this weekend here.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived yesterday in Bagdad, with a stream of displaced people whose money or visa has expired, and others who hoped that the city would return to normality.
Some had even come back to fight the rebels they had displaced from their houses.
At Mansour Busbahnhof, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in a official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operated with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Bagdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a sunny doctor.
"I came back today because of what I've seen on TV and what I read in the newspaper, about what happened in Bagdad, and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, with regard to the casting militia of the military clerk Moqtada al-Sadr, who has appointed his forces at this time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiitian teacher from the most sunnitic part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the regime of Iraqi was not allowed to work.
His Shitian neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local militia supported by the United States has contributed to exercising Al-Qaida from its bastion in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new emigrants from Jordan was the leader of a Sunnian and Shihitic tribe, who had been expelled from his house in Slekh in the north of Bagdad by an attack with handgranates after he had invited his fellow citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He had come back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they started an anti-Al-Qaida mile in Slekh and they needed my support and my boys.
That's why I returned today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been attracted by the increasing rest in the capital since the U.S. troops increase and the growth of local "groups affected citizens", which were armed and defended their districts in cooperation with the American military.
But more said of having been forced home by visum problems and securities in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqians have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shitian Prime Minister, had requested the Syrian Government to impose visum restrictions on refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are likely to have fled by the secular death swadrons in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria, and the government did not force the Iraqi to give visa to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunnin pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
One of the reasons for the decline of violence is that Sunnits were displaced from Shitian residential areas and vice versa, which led to the creation of many places where tensions have left behind.
There are fears that a sudden fluctuation of refugees will reappear sectious tensions and conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal country is the leader in vocational training and even glances with the international orientation of his universities.
Only in one field of education, the Saar countries hold the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-sarian country last 50 times that we are not French" - this slogan places the smallest state of self-ironic at its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the educational system of the Saarland, which is on place five in the educational monitor of the Institute of German Economics Cologne (IW).
Thus, the universities already cooperate closely with neighbouring countries from tradition.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can complete their study here with a double or even three-fold diploma.
Accordingly, the share of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
However, the national children also bring the Saarland to the universities in an excessive number - many of them without a graduation at the gymnasium.
"In Saarland you use the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at the IW.
More than every fifth youth acquires his permission to study at a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The combination possibilities of vocational and academic training are also strongly developed.
As measured by the population, the equipment with dual courses is the second best in Germany.
However, despite practical training and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates in recent years has decreased by a third.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering fields.
"In general educational schools, after the first Pisa study, we have launched several reforms," says one speaker of the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government launched country-wide comparison tests.
To begin learning earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that now also copies other federal countries.
Whether students' performances are sustainablely improved, future comparison studies will only be shown.
With Pisa in 2003, the share of risk schools decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
Overall, however, the Saarland did not increase as strong as other federal countries.
The Bayers are better counting.
And to the confusion of the Saar countries, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area you could otherwise point.
For the language of the neighbors is obligatory to gymnasia - even if the Saar countries are not French.
Chávez turns the clocks around
In Venezuela, the clocks will soon differ from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez lets the time meters in the South American country turn around half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
As reported in Venezuela's Official Journal, a new law states that the clocks are set to the world time minus four and a half hours.
This gives the South American State a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez founded his decision, among other things, that the United States of the world had set up the division in time zones for full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced the interruption of relations with the neighbouring country of Colombia on Wednesday (local time) due to a host business.
The left nationalist said that as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remains, he would not be engaged with the Head of State or the Colombian Government.
"I can't do this alone because of my dignity," said Chávez, who promotes a constitutional reform that the citizens of the Allandes must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would clearly expand his power in the country.
Uribes' decision to withdraw the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia was to refrain from the liberation of hostiles.
On Sunday, Uribe had been criticizing Venezuela with his decision "in his face," Chávez criticized.
Chávez is also in all the mouths in Spain.
A new cell phone clingelton in the country provides furrors: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you hold your mouth) is the sentence that has already downloaded more than half a million people from the Internet.
He was spoken of Spain's King Juan Carlos, who, at the recent Ibero America summit, had been generated by the constant interim calls of the left-wing populist and had driven over the mouth.
German threatens 2007 Lohnminus
Despite the strong conjunction, German workers are threatening a forecast this year.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, the employees in 2007 could actually expect less on the salary account than in the previous year.
"Should be the modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price of food and energy," said Gustav Horn from the Institute for Macroeconomic and economic research of the "picture" newspaper.
New burdens could also be paid to workers in the case of unemployment insurance.
Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück said the New Osnabrücker Zeitung, the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent to change the year in the present situation is right and reasonable.
However, if the Federal Agency for Work should not be reluctant to ask for loans or subsidies at the Bundesamt, the SPD politician has been quoted.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products has driven the inflation rate at the highest level for 13 years.
Total prices increased by 3.0 per cent in the annual comparison.
Venus is the vast twin of the earth
The Venus has been thought more similarly than before, despite its violent atmosphere in the earth: The European space zone "Venus Express" has discovered lights in the atmosphere and windwire on the Poland, as they occur on the earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it is bleeding on the Venus.
The European Sonde "Venus Express" has now provided the evidence - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lights on the Venus shoot in a height of about 56 kilometres from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel from the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Natura".
According to the famous "Ursuppen Theory", lightning has caused life on earth: whirls should have induced reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not like the Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there is hardly something living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than on earth, there are also temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil of the earth, but she is a twin," said Russel.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has made such a totally different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the beginning of the nineties, there has been no way to explore this planet.
The latest research results, which are now presented in several "natural" articles, not only underline the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system.
"You also show that the shares of our neighbor planet with the earth are larger than initially accepted," the Esa notes.
So the researchers found a cloud strudle on the southern pole alongside the already known wrestling wind on the north pole, which turns much faster.
The phenomenon reminds of air flows on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni by the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The secondest planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost the same size with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres.
The planet called morning or evening star also cries around the sun in nearly 225 days.
But he turns much slower around himself: A Venus day takes 243 earthly days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly reminds of the earth, scientists assume that both planets have been created under very similar conditions.
Both of them gathered waters that remained on earth in oceans, but on Venus was lost in the space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonate stones, it is the majority of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkels meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands an end to the party struggle to receive the Dalai Lama in the Canzleramt.
He indirect criticized the SPD for her assaults to the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares for Germany's face and has invited the great coalition to end the fight to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world in this issue," said Köhler to the trade magazine.
At the same time, Köhler signalled understanding for the receiving of Dalai Lama by Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," said Köhler.
Everyone knows that Germany had to maintain sensitive balances in foreign policy, the Federal President stressed, but took Merkel in protection from the precursor, which is a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor has not taken away from traditional one-China politics.
That also knows China," said Köhler.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had indirectly demonstrated discouragement over the receiving of Dalai Lama and had therefore been attacked from series of Union.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's 'Schaufensterpolitik' in foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai Lamas in the Canzleramt, there were severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has invited not only the German Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to information from the SPIEGEL, also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign Ministeries of both countries.
China's Head of Government Wen Jiabao has now invited Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the reception of the Dalai Lamas as a mistake.
China rejected when European politicians officially receive the religious leader of the Tibetans, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The acts and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Schäuble warns against Krawalls as in France
Road slaughter with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schuble warns against Krawalls as in France.
It had to be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany could not be discharged in violence on the road, the Federal Minister urged.
Barrikaden burned, Randalierer shot the police with scrotflinten: After the heavy youth crawling in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
"We must be careful that we do not also build up social explosives and dispose of violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said the "New Press" appearing in Hannover.
Not every young person will be able to cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The covenant, countries and communities already worked with emphasis on degrading problems, said Schuble.
This is not just the integration of migrants.
"From the integration summit to the Islamic Conference, the first success is already shown."
However, it should be too early for warning.
Schuble at the same time pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in German premises as in France.
In northern premises of Paris, young people had delivered heavy street slaughter with the police during the past nights.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
However, the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded greater integration efforts of the Federal Government.
In view of the Krawalls in France, Colat warned against "Nachahming Effects".
The situation in Germany is not as brilliant as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Colat pointed out that the unemployment rate in young people with the background of migration under 25 years is above average.
In particular, more training places need to be provided.
Colat stressed: "We must give young people a perspective."
The chairman of the Turkish community added, however, that in Germany more than in France "a social control is taking place in the families".
Many youths with migration background also did not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Colat urged, "But yet we have to be careful."
You need to "swiftly give you the opportunity to participate in work and training".
In the meantime, it remained much calm in the Paris premises Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of police were in operation, a helicopter fled over the area with lighters.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning trash and cars.
Since the morning, an offer of about 1,000 security forces has provided peace.
The police will intervene for as long as necessary, Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the premises.
In the evening on Tuesday, Krawallen in Villiers-le-Bel had been injured about 80 policemen.
In the following eight, the unrests took over Toulouse.
The Krawalls inflammed at a traffic accident where two young people had died on Sunday.
According to the first findings of the state prosecutor, the police are not guilty of the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Wolke
The realistic appearance of the Chancellor demonstrates that the coalition is at the end - and that nothing of herself is expected.
In what country does this federal Chancellor actually live?
After her controversial appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag, which was worried and poor, you have to say, not here - not in the country that must finally be ruled by it.
Angela Merkel rejected the presumption to focus too much on foreign policy with an angry excessive sentence.
This is provincial, she said, and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what the critics are about.
In the Bundestag, it has documented for everyone how much of their presumption is true.
There was neither a concrete interest nor a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Cloud presented itself: a relieved politician who flees into foreign policy and remains in danger even there.
Example of climate protection: Since it is unbreakable to praise for the decisions of Heiligendamm, it does not say how to achieve the climate targets.
Overall, the self-lob - so much insignificance would have failed the CDU-Chefin two years ago.
Now she climbs to the flourishes that the swelling arrives in the people.
So she damages her image as a pragmaticer, solves the problems instead of speaking nicely to the world.
But in the empire of Angela Wolke, internal policy problems are a border appearance.
Child poverty and the anxiety of the Low Servants?
She's got a few sides left for that.
It is significant how often she promises herself when it comes to the child’s allowance.
Three approaches need Merkel to bring out a halfway straight sentence.
It is stolen as on a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attacks
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney have to deliver a hard stroke exchange - and now have to fear an external candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already on the first topic.
He made New York a "a refugee for illegal immigrants", Mid Romney suggests his Contravenant Rudy Giuliani.
This contends on the other hand with serious suggestions: "I would say that his own house was an harbour for Illegale," Giuliani compensates and insists on the former governor of Massachusetts to have private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blaze for attack: because the Republican base still has no clear favourites, the eight presidential candidates use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-trusted 30-second videos that Internet users have sent in via YouTube are hardly more than keywords.
"With this kind of isolationism we have let Hitler come to power," John McCain suggests his Contractor Ron Paul, who, as the only one in the round, calls for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets strongly read from the Vietnam-Veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "Waterboarding", a narrative method simulated when dispersing, as a torture.
However, the important topics of the campaign in the meantime are beyond Iraq war and torture debates, the reactions of the Saalpublic in St. Petersburg in Florida show.
Whenever conservative values are commended and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium applauds.
It shows again where the weaknesses of the two favorites are.
"I was wrong at that time," explains Romney circumcised and pre-base and television public for his being a member of the abortion supporters in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into the ring when he feels that he is asked for the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf rules for the first time in civilian
One day after his retirement as a Army Eve, the Pakistanian ruler Musharraf has been detained as President.
This ends eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has been spent for another five-year term on Thursday.
The Pakistani television transferred the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital of Islamabad live.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act to the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as a army officer to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani and thus made international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his capture in an unblooded military captain, the former General now rules as civil leader.
With his retirement as the captain of the forces, Musharraf had fulfilled a key requirement of opposition and the West.
Another central demand is an end to the exception state that Musharraf had committed on 3 November.
Soon after his imprisonment, Musharraf, according to General State Attorney Malik Muhammad Qayyum, will lift the exceptional state and thus meet a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the country, which Musharraf had occupied with him in early November, had rejected all objections against the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
At the same time, five soldiers were killed and four more injured in the northern tribe region of North Walesistan.
According to one army speaker, the bomb exploded on a road near the border to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrock return
Germany's Supergroup of the Sixties again musicians: The three band members of Harmonia again took their consoles on a concert in Berlin.
To the Revival, a part of her great time appears "Live 1974".
They were already far more famous in abroad.
The attractive sensation then occurs at the evening table in the form of three set men.
Everyone has his chest before himself, its cables and especially his buttons.
Dieter Moebius thront in the flower white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of laptop and guitar.
Right from the auditory, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is focused on the console.
Everyone contributes noise, sometimes even a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a conventional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The remusic of the band Harmonia has provided some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
What can be revealed here: targeted demands revealed that the name was swept by collective pop memory, but not by any means so persistent to miss this band for 32 years painfully.
But why should the German not also celebrate his living legends from the seventies?
Most of all, what is misleading, in England and America, was always more true than in its own country.
When the music industry gave the Cologne Group Can in 2003 the Echo Prize for Lifework to the survivors of the Cologne Group, it was seen in the hall in questioning German pop viewers.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the bands La Düsseldorf and New! in Laudatio, the surprise did not know any limits.
On concerts Michael Rother later hocked at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the V declaration in the stranger is one.
Therefore, the memory has already been overcome with Harmonia because the Trio existed only two years and has also developed a much lower power than others afterwards have been assigned to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had already musicized with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
==References====External links====External links==
Afterwards, in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a record label maintained by the church.
Rother had helped shortly with power plants and then played a reputation as a guitarist at New!, perhaps the most radical German group at that time.
By 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians into the exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as city refugees.
Less ideological than in the municipality I, where Roedelius was still allowed to plague as a child girl.
More in a spit-wise artist's ancestry.
It is claimed that a wimp of the singing club Harmonia Ottenstein and a name for the art was found in the custody.
Some of them held Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because the music also sounded so loose and modest, the band suffered material need.
The rice collection did not only serve the self-finding.
The CD "Live 1974" was now published in a concert in Griessem, in front of a barely 50-headed record culture, as someone believes to distract himself.
From Rother then came the desire to force Harmonia and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an immoral claim.
The band explained its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in Esoteric-Spheric and secured his existence with albums like "Flamming Hearts".
Cluster has been resurrected in the eighties and has been more successful since it was Harmonia.
The Griessemer live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
This plate company Greenland has been aimed at maintaining the herdrock as an original German contribution to lively music.
New! was already digged out like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin House of Cultures of the World.
Publicly subsidised, within the framework of the Woldtronic Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, old punk and writer of the Manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the Loveparade inventor Dr. Motte.
This would turn the entire bandwidth of the influences of the Krautrock on the following pop music.
The space of the supergroup is filled in by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno swims with the most separate sounds in the hall: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures that show the producers with Harmonia in the farming room.
The legend formation serves projections of other black and white photos of wire cabled devices.
Before that, the three veterans are reconsidered with improvisation.
Not anymore by sticking microphones to the organ and to the clothing to unlock the instruments over self-adhesive power devices.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technically deeper tuppers.
The choir of the house does not change.
Under the direction of Barbara morning stars, sound clouds are heated and whispered and sung at a beautiful place with the Emfase "Aaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never Rock.
The roots were looked less in the blues than in music high schools (Can), technologies (powerworks) or on the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever calls here "68!" is not quite wrong, and Harmonia is not allowed to take away from it now.
Still the most obvious is thoroughly thought on the stage.
Where does music begin and when does she stop?
This can make you rob your nerves or make you feel great lucky.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough
"The Hunting Party" and "Moorderal Peace" again deal with two films with the Balkan War.
But both are not convinced.
Either the concepts put too much on action and ballers or they are too touchful.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: although the war criminals are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but calculated there, in the dark hill of the Bosnia war, the actress Richard Gere has now been found again.
We had last lost the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because too many nice-non-essential roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on Buddhism have pushed you out of the desire to look back.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to look at "The Hunting Party - When the hunter becomes hungry" (Why do film titles today really have to be as long and we're going to look at the lock leader's contracts?).
He delivers a wonderful eye-winking presentation: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have become of Gere if the fate and the film industry were not so graceful: a man who has been behind his best times for a long time, but who himself has preserved considerable remains of the only Charmes as a ruinous monument of his defeat.
But despite this trompet, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production of "Mord peace", which also starts this week, only continues the endless series of failed Balkan war films.
With "Moorderal Peace" you can make a short process: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a serb from cosovarian hill protectors, and one is still in love with them.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not presented here as the sole root of all the evils, the television flake film is losing too fast in the balls and action.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a motorway but for it with war.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be explored exemplaryly why there has never been a really good Balkan war movie.
The story of three U.S. war reporters who are open to discover the Serbian top war criminal "the fuchs" could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" with another director and another rotary author (both in the Staffunion Richard Shepard) at another time.
Because the stories are similar to frapping: Both times small teams go into the forest to do something that the military can't do and both times it's going to be a ride in the madness.
One of the reasons for failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowed to be the downcoming cyanist with a heart when he is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must show him a romantic deal with a later murdered Muslim bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the bach when the reporters succeeded in the last five minutes of the periodic process what Nato, CIA and all the world's head-course hunters have not achieved in five years: catch the war criminal and leave the Muslim Bosnians to fair revenge.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in the Hague for crimes against cinema.
The film has a deepest human concern.
He wants to claim that Karadzic and Mladic are still running freely, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they are supposed to be unanimously agreed) not to exert the persecution due to secret political agreements too intensely.
But the good community and evil are sometimes so similar that a famous bright poem comes in mind.
It says about the wood mask of an Asian demon on the work table of the poet: "I see compassionately the swollen bulls, astonishing: how hard it is to be evil."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such swelling heads, but they suggest how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently, this newspaper reported that all the Iraq films of Hollywood were big flops.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa movie yet.
Nearly always applies: If a star runs around the world's crises or mine fields, something like "Rangoon" comes out with Patricia Arquette, "Overall borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blut Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All conflicts may be too close in time.
After all, decades had to go before Hollywood with "Schindler's list" could turn a good movie over the Holocaust.
Some films may still be mature - the Vietnam works, which are now a classic, "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated unanimously as masterpieces.
But perhaps today we know where every mass murder in real time comes home on equally two screens, also simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And that robbes the graphic writers the uncertainty it needs to tell good stories.
"Sin or nonsense" or "The Great dictator" has finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you shouldn't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Perhaps you need to have the sarcastically remote artist view of Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When the parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War were questioned, he replied: "It is only because some things never change.
Large cities will always be terrible, people will always be murdered in a horrible way and will always rule war in Yugoslavia."
Critics for Olympia Absage are harvested by Beast
The withdrawal of the Mayor of Hamburg's application for Olympic Summer Games has been struggled with vigorous criticism in politics and economics.
Many want to continue fighting for the games on the water.
But from Beust, realism encourages the assessment of opportunities.
The head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, referred to a leave on Wednesday as "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently evolved as great motivation forces in the city as the Olympiaidee.
"Unless this objective, the sport policy swing could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "which comes from a change in time".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained unrealistic on Wednesday in previous statements that the Hamburg Olympia Ambitions are unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic Application, but the German Olympic Sports League," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports League for the beginning of December on Munich's application for winter games 2018.
"This preferredity means for us that we will not have realistic opportunities in the period so far considered by us until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream was not dreamed forever, said of bitterness.
The Hamburg Sports League (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
This makes the impression that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to grow a chance by buried the plans at that time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A failure to apply is also contrary to the statement of the Senate Head on the occasion of a reception to the General German University Sports Association.
There, by Beust, Hamburg's application for the University 2015 was "not a replacement" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The University Sports Association had nominated Hamburg as a candidate city only last week.
The SPD citizenship Group proposed the Senate not to have used valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the little Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because he has put on the Olympia map and tailored the housing building," said the SPD Members Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Small Grasbrook always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later use of living, the CDU set one-sided on the "event factor".
The application for the Olympic Summer Games in 2012 had caused a great enthusiasm in Hamburg at the time.
Hamburg, however, failed in Leipzig.
That's not Warhol's boxes
Who connects the terms of Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or isn't it?
Currently cast wooden boxes in Sweden furnished dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
Most of the four and ninety brilliant boxes listed there from "Type Stockholm" are falsifications.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" has made a few months ago doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo boxes of 1968, internal research in Moderna Museet in Stockholm is now a rewarding result: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén made to the Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - and most of the about a hundred more brilliant boxes of the "type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is strained, a confusing chain of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes", painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cartons of the soap powder "Brillo".
A exhibition of his works at Moderna Museet in 1968 - with Warhol's consent - made hundreds of brillo boxes out of cardboard: these were not (for cost reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo cartons factory.
It was not artworks, it was their models, just exhibition pieces.
At the same time, in 1968 Warhol probably granted permission to produce a few brilliant wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not issued in Moderna Museet.
Time witnesses now speak of about fifteen boxes that were rightly entered the art and auction history as the authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have earned more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it had been produced and issued about a hundred wooden boxes in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left him.
In fact, Hulténs 105 boxes were only produced in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol had been dead for three years at that time.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Moderna Museet, also examined three of the six museum-like Brillo boxes from Swedish private property, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their press bands were first founded and smuggled, afterwards white oil colour was presented with a brush.
The structure of the copies from 1990, however, shows that the colour was placed directly on the press span plate with a painting roll without foundation - also it is not oil, but acrylic color.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo box," says the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to a different conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board announced that the "severe accusations" were taken into account in the matter of the soap powder boxes.
But since then, there is a silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
On the Philippines, rebellious soldiers gave up in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The leader Antonio Trillanes, who presumed corruption and deception of elections, said that he could not blame for blood, reporters at the hotel.
Government-strong soldiers had previously suspended the hotel with tear gas.
The about two dozen soldiers had gone down in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Thursday because of a failure to make a putch in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to suddenly end up with some 30 sympathists.
The military police who were supposed to guard him had apparently passed over to him and joined his muit.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and asked President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to fall.
Loyal government troops locked the district around the pleasant hotel.
The President invited a urgent meeting of the Security Board.
The national security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the operation of the soldiers.
"The people have enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on the people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who earlier commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said that other army units wanted to join the Marsch shortly.
Government critics had called for major demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed by corruption proposals for months.
Manila's financial district was already in 2003 the main viewpoint of the attempted meutery of around 200 military members against Arroyo.
The resurrection failed after nearly 24 hours of refusal to join the army.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts against democraticly elected governments on the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder at Versatel
United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent in the telecommunications company.
The average price per share is EUR 14.46, as the company announced on Wednesday evening.
There are now 20.05 percent of the capital.
A takeover had previously been speculated.
The option is open to increase the share of satel.
This step aims to promote the consolidation of the German DSL market, announced United Internet.
On Wednesday, the Berenberg Bank had increased its participation in the Düsseldorfer network operator by another 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The money house considers the shares only for a third party, said it in the financial market.
In the morning, United Internet had already participated with nearly 10 percent in the mobile company Drillish.
In the context of an increase in capital, Drillian has placed 17.4 million new shares at EUR 106.4 million.
5.15 million shares of them have bought United Internet for 31,4 million euros.
In addition, companies have launched discussions on marketing cooperatives for DSL and mobile products.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet speaker.
The two companies have established the Community company MSP to take over the competitors Freenet.
First, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of about 10 percent of Freenet and do not use their right to take over 18,49 percent to Freenet, United Internet announced on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase their participation in the Freenet AG, said it.
Conversations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership have been closed in mid-November.
The long-term and hard-looking poker around Freenet has been part of the consolidation of the German telecom market for months.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile clients and 1.27 million DSL and complete connection customers.
The Holding of United Internet and Drillish has so far held 6.01 percent of Freenet shares directly.
Now it was agreed that Drillian would bring about four percent more.
The right to buy the 18,49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been agreed in August.
