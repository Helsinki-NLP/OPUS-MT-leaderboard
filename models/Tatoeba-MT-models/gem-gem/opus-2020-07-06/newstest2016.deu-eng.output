Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Teheran destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
However, it is also intended to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the debated two-country solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been excited for years.
Washington criticizes the continuing settlement of Israel and promotes Netanyahu’s lack of will in the peace process.
By the deal advocated by Obama about the Iranian nuclear programme, the relationship of the two has further worsened.
In March, Netanyahu had, at the invitation of the Republicans, held a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress, which was partly considered as a disfront against Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting had rejected it with reference to the present election in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor says he shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a bit citricate voice that he had shot his friend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was criticized on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman that ever loved me." This stood, according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who instructed the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi in two online courses, had already travelled 300 miles to the school site, where he, according to the police, shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He said that Lamb made the horrible emergency call sometime afterwards.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life when the police kissed him.
One day after shooting at the university, students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to picture what motivated Lamb.
The details published by the mediators at both ends of the state, including what students and employees who knew him said helped to draw a picture of a talented but perhaps difficult teacher.
Students said they looked forward to his lesson.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the "wonderable people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teachers comprise 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations of problematic behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that at the end of the academic year 2014-15 he had to deal with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a health certificate and said that he had any health problem.
This year he only taught two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, for which the Lamb had worked so hard, would not guarantee him an automatic way to an appointment as an Assistant Professor.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "naturally there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that the Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lamb's track when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent house on the edge of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogics.
He promovated in the spring in pedagogics.
One of the long-year-old friends of Lamb referred to him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met through common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar game for several years.
He was the woman's swarm at the time.
All the girls swallow there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson foretown of Brandon dwelling.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no evidence of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the backstein house, which borders to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The ex-eheman of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
You and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail occurred three years ago both on a summer year market.
Later they played some gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmonic game before a spare audience.
There was no evidence that something was wrong.
"Simply a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and screwed together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of fun.
Schmidt, the dead professor, conducted the first semester seminar program and specialized in American inhabitants and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his brotherhood and student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people were attended on Tuesday evening, including teachers, employees, students and members of the municipality at a candle-light celebration.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwache while the University's "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lesson will be reintroduced on Wednesday.
"We try to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt and that in his emergency call, the Lamb called Prentiss as his wife, but there is no evidence that the two had ever married.
Toys R Us plans to set less labour for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toys and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and season workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it is planned to set 40,000 people in stores and sales centres throughout the country. At Christmas 2014, 45,000 workers were still set up.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will begin with application talks and the number of employees will rise from October to December.
While the holidays are even months away, the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to set up time workers to provide shops with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox talks about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat is empty next to me, and I gradually realize that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a coming documentary film "Back in Time".
The film starts, and I realize that I am a simulated goat and a arm length away from being with the princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentation on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "inconsistent to the biggest time trip film that has ever been rotated."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinema in October.
UN-Chef says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's strengthened military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five years of conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Head calls on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to unite themselves and to support integrated negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he intends to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member countries of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the UK and France - on the edge of the General Assembly meeting to discuss the situation in Syria this month.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation unsolvable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity in dealing with Iran when dealing with the crisis in Syria.
8 Surveillance values that show that Donald Trump is to take seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others took him off as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the upper edges in surveys, it has (now) not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump lead in two-digit fields, and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomination of the real estate moguls.
Of course it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that Rick Perry's leadership was given to the ascending Herman Cain at this time in 2011, none of whom won only one State in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election.
But external side groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Conservative Group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's persistency and begin to flow their dollars to crash him.
Here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned around 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidateship in mid-June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
Until mid July, there were 40 percent.
At the beginning of August there were 52 percent.
Now six of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Some three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures remain in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa has observed last week that 60 percent of the Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP chooser GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of the Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "arrogant" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" against 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in an enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "insatisfied" or "arrogated" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of the Republicans do not see Trump's Temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, says ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first pre-selection state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of the Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to perform his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not pass into the White House, says ABC/Post.
Republican voters habit themselves to the idea.
When they set up their architectural guards, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When they are asked who wins the GOP nomination most, after a survey by CNN/ORC last week, four out of ten says that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since four out of ten ends of July put her money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP pickers did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At that time in the last cycle, four of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidates in the middle of Romney.
Nevertheless, a variety of GOP choosers consider Trumps campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still hit almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the split field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership while the anti-Trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffus.
But a survey by the Monmouth University early in September shows that in a hypothetic head-to-head race between Trump and most other republikan candidates, Trump is harvesting the majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who hits him?
Ben Carson would overcome the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetic head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald-Trump-Fans says they have made their opinion.
A new survey by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support the Trump say that they have forgiven their voices firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change this, and no one can really say that never change the opinion.
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment the other outsider, the neuro surgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made their opinions are twice as common for Trump.
Six of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the subject of immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his electoral struggle two months ago called immigrants from Mexico, the immigration was the point of turning and fishing in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump will keep crucial Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and will harm the reorientation infringements.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump when it comes to immigration.
So as long as the immigration remains in the ramp light, it seems that Donald Trump will do.
The frustration of the government climbs on new maximum levels.
At Donald Trump and Ben Carson, around half of the support of republikan voters, especially through their external status.
Six of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey by ABC/Post, they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're angry at Washington too.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of four Iowa-Republics are frustrated by the Republicans in the Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "heartily irritated".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here is the most expensive living facility - with a view on the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square metre of a Reetdach house costs in the cut 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the offer of objects is naturally limited," says the study - therefore the high price.
A new study shows in which special locations one square metre cost the most.
Of course, €18.70 per square meter for a student messenger in Munich are not really small.
In contrast to Germany's top places, however, one of the prices occurs like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in swaying heights.
There are once several tens of thousand euros - per square metre, well-noted.
But well, who can afford...
By the way, Munich is not at the top.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-fold Torschütze in Piräus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller made the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then it ran.
A sovereign record of the Champions League season.
The World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the Hexenkessel of Piräus.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won her recording game in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52.90.+2) and Götzes hit (89.) with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start-up success in series is to be the first step towards Finale on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the hackpott to Munich at the third time.
In his 28th match in the Champions League, Müller received good help from Olympiakos Torwart Roberto, who made one of the world champion shooting a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," had the Bayern-capitän Philipp Lahm promised before the game in the Karaiskakis city before 31.688 hot-blood fans - and the coins held words.
They showed a concentrated and committed idea without glittering.
Piräus had won his latest six home games in the king's class, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stole here (1:3).
But the Bavarians, unconquered with Greek teams in seven Europecup duells, did not want to be the next victim.
They struck courageously, but often in their offensive efforts to work unintentionally.
The attacks were launched too often by game shifting to the left outer Douglas Costa, which rarely suffered against the former brown-saving Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right than his flank hit from the right half of the left upper torch.
In the 67th minute the World Champion forgave the possible 2:0.
The best occasions in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when the Olympiakos storm Ideye Brown hit the headball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct reduction, Torwart Roberto paired with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavarians used to raise her dominant game, Piräus could put her needle pieces.
On the gatekeeper Manuel Neuer, however, left.
For example, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the Late (56.).
Before New, Guardiola made a four chain with David Alaba in the centre next to Jerome Boateng, who made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the bar, first sat outside.
The WM herd gave green light only after the finishing training, said the sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Who wants to do something else from it, that's already malicious."
In the first time, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by eleven meters, Müller put one more on it.
Before the game, it had arrived at Krawallen in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially mumbled Bavarian fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the trailers of hosts Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and attacked the coins.
At least a Bayern fan was injured from the stadium.
Whoever smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Whoever smokes does not only harm the lung, but also the teeth - that draws close to a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: If you leave, the risk is falling quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is seen in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Food Research Institute (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smoking, the risk of losing their teeth was greater than 2.5 to 3.6 levels in smokers.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of dental decay are caries and inflammations of the dental meat, stresses the DIfE.
For this parodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and dental loss is therefore back to more frequent dental inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear how much smoking increases the risk of caries.
People who stopped smoking, but could reduce their risk in a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take over ten years until the dangers fall to the level of non-smoking, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham.
People must be convinced to become non-smokingers, study leader Heiner Boeing from the DIfE explained: "Smoking reduces life."
Smoking is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our knowledge, also leads to good dental health until high age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Earlier investigations had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists struggle at Cologne Rheinufer on the rest of the late antique
For repeated times, archaeological findings have been made at the right Rheinufer in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-Germanian Museum have digged out skelette and remains of historical buildings, said museum manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work at the Rhine, historians are looking for so-called ground monuments.
For all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always attached as a specialist office for archaeological groundment care.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
Text documents have already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church had existed, explained Trier.
Besides the rest of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman of goods
After a young woman at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern has been offended, the Federal Police asks the population for assistance.
Early Wednesday morning at 1.40 o'clock, the woman crossed the gleeze from the train station building at the end of the trainsteig and was recorded by a goods train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By the recording of the train, she, according to the Federal Police, carried the most serious injuries of it.
She was natively treated locally and brought by rescue forces to a hospital.
The reason for the nightly crossing of the young woman is not available to the sensible officials.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or inhabitants have taken acoustic perceptions.
Requested residents or passengers from Linderner Bahn, Tegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Street (L364).
Indications given about the cause of the accident can be given under the clock and free Hotline of the Federal Police via telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police office.
The EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute on TTIP
In order to strengthen the dispute on the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private clarification facilities for disputes between groups and states are therefore intended to be resolved by a more transparent system that corresponds significantly to more traditional courts in its functioning.
"We want to set up a system that the citizens trust," said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the idea.
The Sweedin intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position into the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
The TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans for reforming the current divorce procedures specifically provide that EU States and the United States select independent judges for a new investment court together.
They should come from the EU, the United States and from third countries to the same parts.
For the first time, there is also a second instance.
It would allow it to object to judgments.
Until now, the parties to the proceedings agreed on arbitrators, and there was no objection to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past months, it was clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
It wishes to work to an international investment court on a long-term basis, according to its own information.
There could, for example, be clarified disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.
In particular, the investor state skiing procedures required by large groups (ISDS) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, which allows companies to pay damage to taxpayers, to raise national laws or to reduce consumer and environmental standards.
In first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
In particular, it was criticized not to apply to the free trade agreement already negotiated with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) referred to the plans as a major progress.
The Commission took into account essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, had prepared with other EU trade ministers in spring.
The old system of private arbitration courts is from the table.
The French Government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business European Association warned against restricting the economic situation by too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged, said it.
When the discussions on the TTIP Free Trade and Investment Partnership (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have run since mid 2013.
However, the subject of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the Agreement should already be set out at the end of this year.
This date is considered to be not lasting.
Delicat People von Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage in the Kölner Prime Club (now: Luxor).
Besides him, there is a flipchart on which the shy-acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Michigan with filtstick.
The whole audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells about his minuzious and delicate songs on several sites, which he repeatedly records on the map.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his home.
Since then Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative mistake.
With the 2003 released and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", wisely composed songs appear, which are harmoniously close to American people of late 60s, but can at any time operate greatly opulently.
It is the rumour that "Michigan" would be the first part of a contemplated series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be singed as a result.
But already in 2004 and in Rheinähe, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations.
Steven's's is coming down here.
Live is satisfied with guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York will return to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") in 2005, it appears to be an arealy celebrated masterpiece.
Overborder to ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album increases into the American Billboard Charts and is not missing in a year's best list of impressive music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic transfer pieces.
This sixth regular studio album is still widely orchestrad, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
When the smaller clubs expired, the stage shows are here to the colorful spectacle of Neon-Starnbands and large fluorescing stage deco.
Current tour Sufjan Stevens as part of a five-headed band through Germany.
In the dark held Hamburger More!
He presents the theatre mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now in their chairs, Stevens who are clearly mature return to intimity and people.
Without directing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience it is heard that the lecture is "opulent" and can thus throw away the "plate in the ground".
First of all, thank Stevens humbly, plays aqueously few older songs, and ultimately embarrassed.
Jeremy Corbyns Debüt at the Question Time of Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyns Debüt has been expected to be excited at the time of the Prime Minister's question.
The new Labour Vice-President Jeremy Corbyn is supposed to give his debut at the time of the Prime Minister's question and start with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will raise himself in order to ask the first of his six questions shortly after lunch, and his performance will probably be examined by the media and the Labour Members.
He demanded "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it will come after his appointment to the member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TTUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Chairman, on Tuesday during the singing of the National Hymne at a Memorial on the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence, provoked criticism by a number of Tory-MPs, and is at the heart of several headpages stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the National Hymne has drawn attention to him.
A spokesman of Mr. Corbyn said he had standed "in respectful silence" and he acknowledged the "Huldentum of the Royal Air Force in the Air Slay around England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told in the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the National Hymne, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be removed.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they call on differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences are also "step" within the labour market, according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr Corbyn said to the TUC Conference that Labour made changes to remove the whole idea of a total limitation.
hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Labour and Pension Minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the Fifth Labour Chairman, who has been facing David Cameron, since he is a Tory Chief, over the Dispatch Box in Parliament last decade.
The Labour Chairman, who has promised another policy approach, says that he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said that the question time of the Prime Minister is too confrontative and that he will be disregarded both "speaking skills" and the fighting with countervailing, and has taken place instead to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow Minister of Economic Affairs, will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on the way out of the country.
He also put the idea into discussion that other colleagues sometimes take the word and that he spoke to John Bercow, the speaker of the subhouse, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from the politics in the style of a Kasperle theatre, which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed to do so.
Since it was first sent on television in 1990, the question time with the Prime Minister was considered to be the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leader in the subhouse and his position among his colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and need far-reaching reforms.
'Shoted in Joburg': Obsolete youths trained to photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place when you are homeless.
But a group of former roadchildren has found a way to learn a skill and thus deserve living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youths how to take photos of their surroundings and gain a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pfund increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound grew sprongly after data showing an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller command target.
Between May and July, the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared to the same previous period.
This percentage has been the fastest and has been estimated over the date of an interest increase since 2009.
The pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $1.5505 and was climbed to €1.3730 as compared to the euro up to 0.84%.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a 20% jump after the Rival AB InBev's acquisition offer had received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries of the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales numbers strike all expectations and also showed that the sales in China - a key market for Burberry - re-establish growth.
The shares of Glencore increased by 5% after the mining resort said that he took 2.5 billion dollars by a share sale as part of his strategy of debt reduction.
The shares of the packaging and paper group of Mondi were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4,3%, after Goldman Sachs had put his estimate for the company Rating on "sale".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half of the year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion.
The manager of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the bags of potential customers".
But it would be unlikely that this buying force would compensate for the higher labour costs in his company, he says.
The costs could meet JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lappy 21 years young, a hip with upper shear freshness.
The guy with the platin blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy.
More than more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation turns through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
These include Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the police have been sitting on the cold stone plate form of Berlin's luxury hotel at Potsdam's place.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live Idol, whose poster hangs up in Stettin since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs exactly as much on the day as her mom Ewa deserves for half a year.
If any.
She says, "My wiktoria had to sit in the tenth class in the gymnasium."
"I'll fill her with a dream."
School obligation?
Who's jumping?
Not the fans.
Neither beer itself.
He's got out of the way.
For the advertisement in the superbowl's reclame break, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-Pickel Firma, many, many dollars on the biber account.
And every puppe that looks like him and over the store table, also boxes beeber.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're surprised at the windows.
More than 100 million are supposed to have used it.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that beer is finally in the United States and the UK with its new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Beeber itself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he's doing that.
Pegida-Placate brings Libanese on Mapoffeldöner Idea
Potatoes or dances?
It goes both - in the Kartoffeldöner, developed by the Oldenburg Imbise owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase "kartoffel instead of dancer" on a plaque of Pegida movement, Alhay potatoes and meat have been put on a spider together.
On the idea, a poster brought him to a pegida demonstration with the label "Cardoples instead of Döner", which he had randomly seen on television.
Since then, in his store, a barbecue spider has been screwed with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," Alhay says.
The idea has now been allowed to enter Libanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a pattern of use, according to the Authority's information.
The amount of meat and the amount of potatoes of the spider does not want Alhay to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
The culinary consensus also comes well with its customers.
Metcash launches soil resistance campaign to combat Aldi incidence
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA-files from an Aldi-up in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food-gross dealer Metcash has launched a soil resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in front of a 700 million $ Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as events as Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands like Eishermaker Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and store owners who sell tickets for the South Australian football League to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot on the spel, as South Australia and Western Australia are almost 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern States.
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorical provinces and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two countries 12 months after the opening of its first markets and will remove all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, the Analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million sales per year and Metcash 250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will achieve a sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million profit before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the Eastern States, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and will decrease the market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent to 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass' comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash has contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenue from Metcash's food and food trade, which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt reduction in the simultaneous pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesale is opposed and investing more than 150 million dollars to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh food and deliver a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash's main business leader Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and store sanitation programmes will be put to Elan and hope that the wholesaler will return to profit in the year 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kirgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association, Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, who is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came to the light of the famous controversy of Kirgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, with Harrison cried: "Wawrinka had to beat Kirgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen how he broke a tennis strike after a seizure conquered a potential US-open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was steadily defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth around the second place in single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup halffinale against the UK.
"One thing I'm pretty enthusiastic about is the fact that Thanasi, I think, has been brought in a little bit into the dispute," said Healy.
He broke a fighter when he lost in the US-Open because of a seizure, but he is not the first player who broke a fighter of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has acted extremely well in the US-Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around himself, he has a great family around himself, and I think he was treated a little too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he is trained hard, he is good in shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own earnings.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgyos into account in the important preliminary decision, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right thing for all, but he ensures that the man from Canberra returns as a long-term solid part to the team."
"First we wish the team is fully focused on competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has made the rise very fast, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside of the ramp light, in which he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary explains emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the state of emergency and refined the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held everyone who tried to get illegally into the country. Everything aimed at stoping the influencing of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in no country and Serbian officials reacted with distress.
People who had fled from violence stuck for an unknown time in a land line on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and stayed there.
But frustration grew.
When a police helicopter slept over them, the migrants scanned "Open the border!" and shouted indignations against the Hungarian security police.
Some showed back from protest food and water.
Serbia's Minister for Foreign Affairs explained that it was "incredible" that migrants from Hungary would be sent back, while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbien) wants to be part of the solution and not a collilateral damage.
Conversations with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulences at the Hungarian-Serbian border were not able to agree a common immigration policy one day after the 28-National Block at a conflicting meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40 000 people who sought refuge in overwhelming Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU countries would take up another 120,000 refugees, including some of them from Hungary.
On Tuesday, Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not set his hopes for a soon action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The emergency in two southern regions called on Tuesday gave authorities more power to tackle the crisis so that they could lock roads and speed up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto also said that his country also plans the construction of a barbecue line along its border to Romania to stop the influencing of migrants through the country - after it has completed a cavity at the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison asses were used in the race to create the Stacheldraht Zaun between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant tightening and starting point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has stressed that most of the incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly contrary to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4-metre (13 foot) high tower, which the government built along the southern border of Serbia, a crime. These laws also set higher penalties for condemned human dealers.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government explains the state of emergency," said government speaker Zoltan Kovacs Reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament must continue to agree on the use of the military, which is expected for the next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen severely armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, National Security Adviser for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people in attempting to cross the border, 15 others were already deeper in the country.
They come over by harming the tongue, they are now in police guard and are accused of the infringement of crimes according to the new laws.
The authorities are in order to quickly repair the tongue.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train watch with stagger wire to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main crossing of borders near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data from people and pressed a crowd to push in there.
Some 20 were able to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's precursor to Bernie Sanders in national survey half
The former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the democratic race for nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins against the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre-elections (58 percent earlier), while Sanders is secondly, by 27 percent (elevation by 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the Presidential Office, receives support from 15% of the democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographical groups, while Sanders has gained some profits.
Clinton keeps a great precursor in women and moderates, but this precursor has decreased.
Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only back here with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has left, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
However, Clinton still has a great precursor in the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders with two-digit leads with the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point front in this group.
Approximately half of the democratic voters of the pre-elections throughout the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if it was nominated by the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because she is the candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support them.
Maybe not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic of her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiasticly support them.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become President (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Assistance to deal with the problems and the choice will also be quoted.
Since the Vice-President has a potential for the Presidential Office, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the pre-elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not.
If democratic voters are asked who would be their second election for the party, bids are at the top.
Of Clinton's followers, more than half say that bids were their second choice far from Sanders.
If Biden decides not to be able to nominate the democrats, Hillary Clinton's precursor increases before Sanders, from 20 points with bids in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the choice, but this number has fallen by 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is a second at this measurement with distance, but the percentage that considers it the most "selectable" has risen.
Nevertheless, in the question of what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about the choice.
Similarly as last month, no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elections is unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features in the elections of their party.
Most people view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong management qualities.
Biden best cut off with the three candidates at honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not believe in it.
Democratic voters of the pre-elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server are still being asked as Minister for Foreign Affairs during the term of office, most Democratic voters of the pre-elections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions as a whole.
But it's another story in the U.S. public as a whole.
The half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one third is satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided in March shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion of it had worsened.
It is primarily Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is regarded as honest and trustworthy by the voters of its party, this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the voters do not think they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the electorate are also viewing Trump as unhearted and unreliable.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good notes on leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, bids, Carson and Bush are best cut off in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters in the pre-elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson starts nearly behind Donald Trump during country-wide survey
Ben Carson is located closely behind Donald Trump at the latest survey by CBS News/New York Times
The two candidates are now the half of the voters' support in the new survey, and others are dramatically losing stop
Republican voters continue to support Trump in a large number of countries. Support increases from 23% in the last CBS survey, which was carried out before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson shot from 6 % to 23 % during the same period.
The survey also showed that Carson is well attached to demographical groups and exceeds Trump among republikan voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsins Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the deepest, from 10% support in the last month to 2% now.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida senator Marco Rubio are on the third place with 6%.
The error margin for the sample of 376 persons from Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6% and was performed in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson increases in the surveys – he lands with 19% support to the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The recent survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With view of a Carson rising in the last week, Trump found some side-hiebe for the former neuro surgeon, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa.
pleasant bath temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm to 29 degrees.
Although top values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is already enough for bathtubs to find even warm water.
A bathroom in the North or East Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go to the sea: max. 18 degrees have the water in the North and East Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) announces.
Bathing temperatures, however, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the East it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic region, there are 25 degrees at the top, 23 degrees in France.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College-newling
Nearly two years after a student died during a shicanous ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, the mortgage is submitted against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police informed.
Officers said that he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became unpowered and were supposed to wait a hour before they brought him to a hospital, said the police.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng to the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice, said police officer Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"On this point the members began to hide utensils and in principle put the welfare of the brotherhood about that of Michael Deng," said Head of Police Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly added with stump force injuries of head, rump and upper bowels.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the shakes of the brotherhood. At least one student dies in the Shikans since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherships and their members must be taken into account, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge for murder for the first five members.
Two-and-third members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also accused of shy attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We want not only to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will also take them into account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has forbidden the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has withdrawn its belonging to the local group.
This will happen when the fat increases the interest rates
An increase in interest comes, and the houses will be raising, profits for loans will rise, and the economy will glide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers only little guidance for the economy to run.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first rate increase and took 86 months.
The aggressivity of the Federal Reserve when raising the interest rates is often, although not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial facilities react.
Therefore, representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly emphasised that investors should not focus on when they begin to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
However, at the end, market participants could find that the whole excitement could have been excessive because of an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of the "fair money", said Julian Jessop, Chefokonom at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights, but still at a low level to lead to the seismic shock, which many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no effects.
Here is a view based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has seen last month, the preliminary increase in interest can make things for a while volatile.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that asset revenues will be defeated 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy," said German bank analyses in a recent study on what happens after interest increases in the feed.
More precisely, in the past 35 years, the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase, rather flat in the 250 days afterwards (mean profit of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis that Bob Doll, Chief Investment Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, published at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the profit begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote.
In the present case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that there were not before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in an interest increase in the feed.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest increases since 1950 were only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, only few expect this to last and expect only 1.5 per cent for the third quarter according to Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such fragile economic cults could be risky and raise the question, "if it is different this time," said the Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken up the whole year for an increase in the rate of the feed, and all eyes were addressed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many streets and economists believe that the FOMC could accept an increase in this session, the Futures trade only indicates a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with an increasing swing at GDP and pre-recessment heights very quickly after the start of restoration," said the report.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is widely the longest that the feed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this has been 74 months.
The solid income was also volatile, as the market advances an increase in interest, and the pattern is quite similar to that on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on loans is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of loans, the profits appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle takes place.
At the end of the increase cycle, the investors fall immediately, said the Deutsche Bank.
The streets of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer collapse between longer and shorter loans and lead to a deflection of the curve.
High interest loans often bring better earnings in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher earnings," said Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analysis at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"Apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, loan margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all the market characteristics when the fat intensifies its strategy.
In general, companies who develop the larger part of their business in the United States will benefit from increasing interest rates and become more attractive in local products.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse because an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also finances their debts.
"The story shows that "Quality-" shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest increase," said Goldman Sachs-Analysten in a report to the customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have averagely exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital profits and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality pendants by an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points).
Guilt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Sparers could see profits by higher earnings, even if experts differ from their opinion on how fast this will take place.

The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the sender for his "dumping"
He argues that he is increasingly different from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitate The Brits
Parliament college Damien Collins attacked the Voice Mission and said that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "converts" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the sender to prove that he does something that the private senders don't do.
The Conservative Member Andrew Bingham also told the BBC forests that the public-rechtliche radio broadcaster was "dumping" and increasingly no longer to distinguish from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumping" - but it seems to be transformed into Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which started in December last.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be only under a different name.
So, if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples, in which you simply imitate what is already on the market," said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director-General rejected the suggestions and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors in the field of live music and public information.
What I learn from Radio 3 I will learn about classical music nowhere else.
And there's a commitment for live music and musicians that are really unavailable.
"And to find the commitment of Radio 3, new music and to give up new works, I also think really important," he said.
In the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classic music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of BBC production, which was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports for the election of Cultural Rivals.
The tory member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC, which was purchased by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often being discussed because it is not original and not particularly significant?
Lord Hall pointed out that the BBC 1-show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on special BBC-Weise".
He added that he wished that the company "finds a hit from our homelike chair" when it starts a entertainment series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or spend money from the payers for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015 there was seven percent increase in online sales.
In the last month there was the lowest result since the start of the recordings in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday brake the expenditure in November
For more than a decade the virtual shopping has treed, and many of the main shopping streets of the UK have transformed into spirit cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stantering after new figures have shown only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that the online sales stagnize after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, this has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, publisher of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago, when buyers started to buy with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now this is incredible, and we may experience that growth is reduced.
The Black-Friday phenomenon, which has been imported from America, is quoted as a reason for the releasing transactions.
Experts believe that buyers hold their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of purchasers around their computers was five times to make their barrels, and some trader websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyers fought for sneaks, could stop buyers from making purchases.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that 5 £ spending a little more than 1 £ online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are now made via web shops.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in interior cities.
Muslims bury the killed in Mekka in the crane accident - Bin Ladens family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funerals in Mekka by the streets
Saudi Arabia loads the collapse part of the huge Saudi Bin-Laden Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered, when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed on Mekka's grandmoshee.
Traurigents filled, largely dressed in white, the route to count their respect when the first of the dead took their last trip to the Al-Moaissem Peaceyard.
The mourning procession moved over at the Holy Place, where only days earlier a crane of the crane passed through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell on the prayers.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king penalized a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family due to the disaster that also left the injured ones.
The bodies of 29 Betters who were killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Moscow Mekkas, were carried by the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Great Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrim trip when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi-officers have already agreed that the Haddsch would continue to go to Mekka with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group should not have left the arm of the crown when he was not used.
A Arab version of the Dekret published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin-Laden Group was responsible for collapsing.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's leadership of foreign travel is prohibited.
At the beginning of this week, Salman exhibited to reveal what caused the fall of the crown, who crashed into a large mosquitoe courtyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsch, which later took place this month.
The Bin-Laden Group did not publish any statements on the collapse of de Krans, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also dealt with the group because of non-current security measures and because it had not cooperated with meteorologists.
Thousands of cranes surround Mekka's Großmoschee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
For decades the Bin Laden family has been associated with the rulers' family of Saudi Arabia and takes over larger construction projects.
The dead leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was dismissed by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crown came in the midst of strong winds and rains, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrim journey, which is required at least once in the lives of each healthy Muslim.
Officers said that 158 people stayed in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million rial ($174.000) should be paid to the members of the dead and the same amount of permanent damaged.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern craft workers is over
Brits are increasingly busy craftsman, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craft workers from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 additional screwfix loads aiming at craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales sites throughout the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that Brits defeat their inhibitors and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
If you can pass with a hammer or brush to strike walls, you seem to be a minority today.
For the British are increasingly working craftsmen to perform homeworks in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new manager of Kingfisher, who has the construction market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe, which offer services at lowest prices is now overtaken.
Consequently, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops that are directed to craftsmen and to close 60 sales sites of B&Q.
Mrs Laury said she wants to work more women in B & Q-Shops, because eight of ten purchase decisions are made in store by women.
At the moment, the men are overwhelmed by the staff.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographical trends, which have more female single households that are making more renewal than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to move this further to a balance.
Basically, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women on the top of a British director in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructed her top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important subject here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher mentioned a decrease in half-year profit and sales after the group trained the cost of closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who has screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Functioners of Aich/Dob for unfaithfulness in court
On Wednesday, at the Landesgericht Klagenfurt two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vizemeister Aich/Dob had to be responsible for unfaithful and discharged.
The accused did not know who was guilty.
One of them had also been accused of misuse of office.
In May he was legally freed from this presumption.
The current process has been delayed.
According to Oberstaatsanwalt Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, the accused had been crystalized out that in the years 2006 to 2011, the defendants were allowed to use money from association accounts to be available in their functions for private purposes.
The damage is summarised by around 400,000 euros.
Sports functioners are also accused of financial failure.
This fact discontinued the Chairman of the Schöpensenats, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later time.
The defense demonstrated that the association had at no time resulted in an asset disadvantage.
The sports functioners would only have compensated burden damages, and the sport club for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and invested in a lot of time and money had been out of debts - the passives amounted to around 600,000 shilling in 2001 (ird 44,000 euro).
"Then we faced the situation: Are we going on the club or are we blocking?" said one of the accused, in the Brotruf Großbetrieb Prüfer of the Financial Office.
He, with his colleagues and fellow complainants, decided to take this task.
With all the risks.
"We have shot money, put our life insurance as a security at the bank," he said at the agreement.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, it must not be made any debts.
In addition, in the event of financial success, the reimbursement of burden losses had been decided back by 1991.
Therefore, part of the burden losses were paid only years later, since 2003, when an plus had been on the account.
Thus, the former obmann also appeared to have fixed and not detail bookings, explaining the transactions.
The accounts and spare books managed the two accused together, said the second accused.
The judge asked why the payments had not been made available in detail to the association.
The association was not interested in the financial event in detail, so the answer was important only for the freedom of debt.
In 2011, when one functional investigation started for misuse of office, a amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
That would have been reimbursements, the accused.
This securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known to the association according to its statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The interviewer didn't know any answer for a long time.
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the association.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The fellow accused had been informed, the functioner justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "skade reimbursement".
Why damage?, Judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first accused said that he was not in agreement with this formulation because the association had never caused any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "With him are you all out of the cutter."
"Is I a legal representative?" he asked.
The functioner also said that he had never paid a cent salary, he only calculated kilometers of money and diets.
In the case of diets, he took account of the association of EUR 1,000 per month, but the actual effort had been much higher, he added.
Exact documentation for the early years could not be provided by the accused.
They were no longer preserved after an operating test in which everything was judged as correct, they explained.
Military money had also been paid to the second accused.
All decisions have been carried out in bar, and he had to drive from his place of residence to the Bank to Bleiburg, he stated in his statement.
The main debate will be continued on 23 September with the consultation of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard strikes more 30,000 jobs
In addition to the degradation of staff for three years, the computerry will reduce further jobs in the division of the company.
The job breakdowns at the US computerous Hewlett Packard (HP) will not end.
The US technology group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its business customer savings in the context of its restructuring.
This would save costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company informed on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars, which will attack from the fourth quarter.
The degradation of 55.000 jobs has not been completed for three years.
At the end of the 2013/14 financial year, HP was still working around 302,000 employees.
Afterwards, the Hewlett Packard Act gave 2.3 percent.
The group of printers from California Palo Alto is currently splitting up: This is how the computer and printer business is still to be connected in a new company – separated from the more future areas with computer servers and data stores for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business are to be noted at the stock exchange.
A more disappointing PC sales and a weaker demand of business customers for its services, the second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo in the world was the last.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the sale of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 per cent.
The turnover fell by 8 percent to nearly 25.4 billion dollars.
In 15 out of 16 quarters, the remuneration returned.
HP responds with a splitting and massive shifts to the change in the industry.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only responded lately to the increase in smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and to do more and more business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans totally provide for the degradation of some 55.000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority support the Anti-IS training mission
A direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would, however, be mostly rejected: 54 percent, on the other hand, 35 percent proved acceptable.
That other countries are flying air attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria, 61 percent are positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian ruler Baschar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents that would be 20 percent.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second press day on the 66th IAA
The centre of the fair is networked, self-curring cars and electric mobility until September 27.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Connected" on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the VDA car association are estimated to be about 900 000 visitors two years ago.
Röszke: Violent outbreak at Serbian-ungarian border
The Hungarian police have spent on the Serbian border at Russian tear gas and waterlights against several hundred refugees.
Euronews-Correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
After that, a police line had shaped itself and behind the police was a water lighter ready.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles to the officials.
At first, the officials used uninterrupted pepperspray.
Then the police used tear gas.
Many tear gases were sprayed towards the refugees.
This dissolved the group.
The refugees have now retired a little awaitingly.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone.
Children who had breathed the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees were sucking together and suffering from breathing.
The press speakers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. note bank
The world observes when the US notes bank meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether the interest is raised for the first time for almost a decade or not.
A survey under 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that was still the view that the Fed would do this now believes that the fat will persist even longer and that the interest rates will be maintained at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's been seven years ago since the Fed interest put on NULL.
"For the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalization of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good level, billions of dollars are added to the balance and generates only a small inflation.
However, the fat cannot ignore the less bright view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to look forward to an increase, but the signs suggest that the opportunities for such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced at 20 a.m. on Thursday
Death protection at Delta State University left a letter of excuse
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was "threatening" on the first murder and wanted to "he could do it unhappy," announced the authorities on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, teacher for Geography and Social Science at Delta State University, called emergency number at 10:00 on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency headquarters that the police had to send policemen to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" is in the house, but "none will disturb", but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When the police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, who said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when the police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he didn't know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "naturally there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb supposedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt too, authorities said on Tuesday, there was "no information, no evidence" for a "thriegon relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who declared that they were married about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "devastated on the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolute best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, met with Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to say, "He won't go to prison."
When policemen picked him up on the highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb went his car to the side, flew to the foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral title from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his lifelau indicates on the University's website.
Stars that lost their lucky associate
The actress (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he struggled against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-year-old partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor also claims to fight drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for drug possession.
All of this certainly demands his prize.
Eurowings: Lufthansa transforms the group
The Lufthansa plants a large group.
A half billion euros a year will save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organisation.
150 of the around 1,000 leaders worldwide will cost group construction the workplace.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union.
The Lufthansa reconstructs its company structure and advocates Eurowing's cheap daughter.
The objective of the re-establishment is a result of around 500 million euros per year from cost and sales synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer be in charge of the passenger business.
The Eurowings airline should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team of Chief Carsten Spohr.
The new establishment underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group will in the future encounter Ryanair and Easyjet.
Until now, the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex.
The airlines firmed under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the Tariff Conflict with the Cockpit Pilot Association (VC) the negotiations will be restarted after the legally stopped strike on Thursday.
That announced the trade union.
The subject of discussions is to be the pension scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve "in one year with a forecast recording result" as soon as possible portable results.
The conflict between trade union and airline led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of pilots, background is the "Wings" saving concept.
It provides that the Lufthansa is transferring routes to the conservative Eurowings cheap line in the fight against competitors.
Among the title "Morgenzug in the south" are paintings of Leena Krüger in the artist's house.

Luke Shaw by Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left external defender to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again during this season.
The injury was caused by a reluctant attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the game field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and lies in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes with 18 in Manchester United, it's very difficult and then plays fantastic, and then this happens.
In the dressing cabin, he had a oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an eleven meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had failed.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an eleven meter and a red card were falling.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to heal begins now, I'm coming back more."
Concerning this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat at the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the UK defender has an additional incentive to recover until the next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this kind of injuries leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a bone break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Hollandmanship at the WM 2014.
"He is very difficult because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction, so it looked like [Moreno] touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard something can be.
I feel very bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It is one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not last long until you almost know it out of the way.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to call his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the environmental fabel published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss, decided.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "pleasant, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read my children, because there seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
All good and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron claims to describe the act of the book, indicates the content of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a product, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling their desire to see a real tree," reads one. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seus's Geisle and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this would not be suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a product, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the act of the book. Here, a unnamed boy hears, as the local environment is destroyed by the money-girdy, trees falling, thneed striking once-ler despite the protests of the nicking Lorax, a hocking, crawling being, "that speaks in the name of the trees".
It is most likely that such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times after each other.
A downing-Street speaker said that the text was probably from Cameron's election circuit office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England's team, but it's still difficult
To hit Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the box that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series downside is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outward victory.
Alastair Cook's page may be less experienced than those three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting setup, and the Community spirit is strong; they will not wear fools from 2012, only a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related message: Adam Lyth separates from the England test bar and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, hard to analyze for me as his chief trainer in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There was no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to nomination, since - and I said this before - players are their own best selector.
A long time ago, Lyth was extended, but he had control of his own fate.
Hopefully, if he's going out further runs for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The English trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not perform so good services, and that doesn't surprise me; he is primarily a team man.
The question of how much time a test-slayer gets to set his sign is difficult.
Lyth received seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only presumption you can raise was that England first engaged Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a killer I appreciate.
He is a X-factory cricket player, which we saw early in this season at Yorkshire when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge, which met us very much.
He must at least receive the same chances as those before him, but this is of course dependent on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen beat next to Cook, which would produce an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing to do with it.
I don't see why a hitman can't hit there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a devil bastard of Cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a back-up spider, and in my limited association with him he has very impressed me as a young man.
People may see their statistics - average 31 with the fighter and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spinners who lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
In addition to the team, England has made a few wise supplements to the trainer staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game that will bring a lot of experiences, since he has played on all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing cabin, even if the news are in line with the previously said.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part.
Although some will not agree, coaches and team makers do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made of a light heart.
The Brexit layer (Brexit = outturn of the UK from the EU) could be accelerated if the economy was placed in a flat by 2017
David Cameron's unprecedented new negotiating strategy to keep the United Kingdom in the EU will be deeper with every day in trouble, even without the choice of the gentle Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, who is severely breaking for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply intersected in various crises as the EU is now and not always out of their own debt, the UK's own agenda with divided concessions and disturbing contractual changes which they mostly do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it threatens social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie calendar.
Prime Ministers and Ministers of Finance climb at summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes to see a UK outside in the EU tent - "Don't let us alone with France," says Berlin, and lets see that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals that cares if we stay or go.
Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an alliance, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has happened to the excessive long endurances such as Thatcher (11 years), the middle edge (14) and the coal (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's also a bleeding force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a link.
It is difficult to imagine that they will cut out a leg in order to help the Selfie-brites whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland's withdrawal from the UK - something they do not want because most of the similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some of these ministers may deliberately plan not helpful comments, quite in the SNP style, while the UK referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The new negotiation was a Pleite" and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the new negotiation."
The Europeans know how robberically the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU-scepticians are the oligarchy of the press barones, as they were, but not during the referendum in 1975 inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can remember Boris Johnson, the Erz-Euro opportunists who made a name as a "EU-Gerade-Bananen" Brussels Correspondent in the early 90s.
In all his crazyness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-frightening shoes, phone-hacking foreigners and the Pseudo Non-inlanders, who possess most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but noted that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum wrestling, because Blair had put the principle on the EU's unaccepted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened him a back door.
The press never forgot that to him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly knock on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he wouldn't have to waste time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnocks Boykott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake at that time and today.
It can take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC-Sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe - I'm pressing it friendly - is in development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukips traditional blue-colour tendency and the wilder filts of Tory's small-englandism are probably all able to say yes.
It's what Hilary said "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn in the radio and television this week when the path finder struggled in him, not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocating John McDonnell as a shadow Chancell was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his labor cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet tub.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor was what JC told his competitors and members after all the reports on their clause meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the touchful bottom-up image of Corbyn wants - remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the strudel of social media, a breach place of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to hold Labour support in the referendum campaign for a naturality, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins surely thinks so.
However, McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities about EU membership - in line with their pronunciation of camping economy, their anti-capitalistic past - are no longer just a question of the esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for which the Narzissmus of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguity to the Nato - Tom Watson, it is strongly convinced that JC does not launch a campaign for the exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have distrustful voters - to make concessions to the British if all of this can be meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction in the Tory government in power, which was reminded of something called the British Influence Security Forum at the start of Monday.
Experts criticize the report of Public Health England on e-Cigaretts
According to a publicly funded agency that e-cigaretts are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-Cigaretts.
PHE published the "Grundsatzbericht" last month and describes it as a "total review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the burdenability of the data and pointed out the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A guide article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "exceptionally windy basis" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two further researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor for Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects the claim of PHE that "the present best estimate is that E-Cigaretts are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were invited to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision-making analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) in order to bring their opinions about the damages of various nicotin-containing products into synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health whose leader had previously received British American Tobacco Mittel (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an E-Cigarett manufacturer, but not the funding he had to have received in advance from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, added.
The reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered, but include several known E-Cigarett Champions, some of which also specify a industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
The meeting also took part in PHE's tobacco management.
The research work of the group "remarkably confessed" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the injury of most products at most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, no such links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there has been no evidence that e-cigaretts serve as a way of smoking for children or non-smoking" were presumed.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ have already been reacted before.
He said, "E cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die of a disease related to smoking each year, and smoking costs two billion £ per year.
By the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigaretts are not without risk, but only represent a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national responsibility.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Chief of Channel 4
The former Chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "will give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-rechtliche programmes, which are likely seen by a smaller audience, into hard-controversial time windows against the most popular showes of their rivals and broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC is giving or sending programs that would also clearly be shown by non-subsidised rivals," Johnson said to the Oberhaus Communication Committee in the context of his study on the future of the BBC.
If you want to hold the broadcast fee, which I do not think in medium or long term for a good idea, you should at least give your production on programs that do not make or order others.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that anyone else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's naturally nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax funding programmes that could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
In fact, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am endeavoring to see how this is supposed to be public- jurisdiction television.
I do not think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur of series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was guilty of the hunting for evaluations "because the ambitions of people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the most popular BBC broadcasts reflect what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like EastEnders should be sold.
Johnson said that the rather public-rechtliche Nisch programs should go "to BBC4 where you can't measure the audience, but they do their tasks, and they can argument if they go to their seemingly sacred missions to justify 4 billion £ radio charges, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen."
They put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them.
Johnson said to the Committee, "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value out of this.
Of course, you all think, we all think that you get a great value here for 150 pounds per year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, ask me if that's right, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5-Chef David Elstein, who also stated before the Committee on Tuesday, called on the BBC to verify its Reithian mission "to inform, form and entertain".
He said that little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of her TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and she should take an example of "informing, informing and entertaining" on the public television broadcasters in Australia and Canada.
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the proms, of which he said that only one handful is shown on television, and with the commercial broadcasters are going into allians to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematods change the direction in the moment when they are radiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The small nematods change the direction in the moment in which they are illuminated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More about this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new process called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the process could replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive process that gives electrical impulse to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson disease.
Threadworms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasound waves that then enter the worms.
The increased ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4-ion channels and found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves make the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to, so a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematods, Chalasani genetically changed the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4-ion channels.
When he uses ultrasound on the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the microblows and transferred to the worms where they activate the modified motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities with optogenetics, a train breaking tool that allows scientists to switch and disable neurons with impulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages to this technology.
In contrast to light that needs to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, low frequency ultrasound waves can occur unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with genetherapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical attitude for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right in front of your door!
The advertisements shame British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Messen-Video.
Terrible killer drones!
Footwear cutting legs!
Strobe!
And electric shock stiffs that cause pain, but do not leave any trace!
The joyful voice and cartoon images make no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a fighting parodie produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the British Government's willingness to light, to consolidate weapons of repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Dockland.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: From 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the types of the London Underground and the marks of the DLR line, which turns into the picture of a panzer.
In September a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the gun knife.
The 300 posters are from artists who have issued their work in the Museum of Greyful Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped to distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 £ pack of inbus keys, which claims that "access to about one third of the bus stop areas on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this placing "Vandalism" funny.
One of the parodie displays produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and teacher at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go out to the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-wap trade plaques greet the pendlers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the Advertising Agency VCCP, who works with the graphic and Voiceover artist, who also works free of charge.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was surprised by the silence that ruled around the advertising for the arms knife - by an empty place of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "If we give them the campaign to avoid them."
They played with the invention of a more realistic twisted business recruitment, but "by bleeding with bright colors and animation it remains more responsible."
"You have made a fantastic job by helping us to conscious of the sale of illegal torture devices on the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention of the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illegally traded before our door.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms knife comes from the area inside of ExCeL, where exhibitors fantastically scatter euphemistic products.
In a press release Saab reveals a mission of the US army about "the AT4CS RS cast off the shoulder."
This includes a "onesomely shaped battlehead, which delivers outstanding post-effects in the inside of the target."
Whatever this does, it will not be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for life in student homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgetten 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still in faith in Berets and moral relativeism, but only now I remember the excited smiles of those who I have angry - and the many long-term complaints about others.
Most of the things I learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to student homes is sufficient from slightly nervous to absolutely terrifying.
It is enticing to squat: people tell people where you come from, whether and where you took the Sabbath year, where you are in Corbyn and why you "honestly said Marmite doesn't love or hate, because seriously, boys, it's just a hefe extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you might like, in contrast to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your wimpers were burning and these fires would be.
Let people go.
The rooms of people are often transformed into drinking recipes, movie night events and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress and rearrange their underwear.
Concerning this: Don't think about starting at the uni with a relationship
Introverted people receive a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a room-to-room cotton culture that can be friendly and social and lead to lifelong friendship.
That could be hell for someone who's trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can recover the energy I used for interaction with you."
Try to feel when a comilitone of sociality is exhausted - and send him a SMS instead.
Associate: Do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by backing.
Since you start the Uni at the peak of the Back-Manie, the clapping at the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of Brownies is less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome in the neighborhood, I have backed you something. So, and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade delicious properties is a good way to close friends.
Your inhabitants feel obliged to entertain and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Bad mixed clumps of flour, sugar and fat lead people to sleeping when you climb.
To steal food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course the cloning of chickens is a thief, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check this with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's angry, and you have my compassion - but you try to handle it more balanced than my inhabitant who added her milk a dishwasher to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make noise that keeps people from sleep or work.
It is not only about being a decent person, but that in the most true sense of the proverb you belong to the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my corridor asked her neighbors if it was something to them to put Drum & Bass a little quieter, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When she finally stopped at five o'clock, she kindly left her neighbors sleeping two hours before she left her own music plundering, closed her door and went to her three-hour trial.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future mate would accidentally move into the same student home?
On the other hand, it wouldn't be roughly embarrassed if you think that your future mate is in favour of your future mate, go to her, divorce and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she moves all the common friends over to herself?
Of course, the heart goes its own ways - but if a warm resident is definitely not your future mate, at least try to make a little sense in your subsistence.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between an ulk and a mobing is finer than it seems.
A good string is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a bumerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but never swallow anyone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close her door, and put their keys into a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer cabinet - but take not more than twice the property on the ceiling.
Serial houses for refugees, single-owned, small-scale earners
The real estate operator Markus Gildner builds series houses in the middle-frank cornertal for people who do not have much money.
So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need dwelling, but also the only maternal mother and the lowly earner."
"I show how to build a favorable and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push on the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheap living room can be created: he builds series houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push on the home market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or tour halls has no sustainability.
'Cause people are staying here to a large extent.
Given the flow of refugees, we also need sufficient living space in the next decades.
A completely banal, three-level row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least place.
It facilitates integration.
It's different when you put people in the blocks.
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three living units for four asylum candidates each.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it's peace again, I'll go back.
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living per house amounts to 184 000 euros, without property.
It's overlookable.
The construction took six months.
That is appropriate.
Did the construction regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: I have done my project correctly by building law.
Especially complicated it always makes the threatening Damocles sword special construction and the placement regulation.
Terrible.
It is still subjected to the one who creates three apartments in a row house, needs at least three seats.
Only in the cities there is no room for it.
And refugees and asylum candidates have no cars.
How have the residents responded to their series house project?
Gildner: There were some who have proposed me to create luxury buildings for asylum candidates.
What's definitely wrong.
But don't you sharpen the competition fight for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True, we have had a building tree in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments were built, which can hardly afford one more.
My project has the message, including the normal people need living room.
Not only refugees, but also the only maternal mother or the lowly earner.
I'll show how to build a favourable and well today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first studied environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple updates are published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration app, typing on "General" and then selecting "software update".
When ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have come to problems after installing because they receive an error message that tells you that the "software update has failed".
To cope with the problem, users are recommended to either wait until the storm goes back or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean the removal of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more unlikely by delaying the update. Similarly, it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to remove apps and then install them again once the process is finished.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is uploaded during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to be continued, as the phone may turn off halfways and this could lead to a cancelling of the update.

Rosberg's only Devise: Full Attacks
Nico Rosberg knows in the fight around the WM title in the Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton only one more devise: "Volle Attacke".
The WM second stressed before the start in the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing to lose".
53 points separate the Vice World Champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday by title defenders and double champion Hamilton.
The British already won seven of the previous 12 seasonal races and also attacks the riverlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British could win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will influence the Great Price of Singapore is still unclear.
For days a dark bell hangs over the city, triggered by fires on the neighbouring island Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The Schachclub "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen" founded three months ago, took another member into his series, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gaußelmann is the carrier of the Federal Service Cross 1 Class and Honor of the cities Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The Schachclub in Bad Kissingen supported Gaußelmann with a donation that President Alfred Klein received.
This will enable chess players who are unable to offer the member contribution.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership of the Schachclub and also friendly contact with the Tennisclub "Rot-White" will be seen as an expression of its association with the Kurstadt.
Quartiers Office searches directly contact
Saludis and the Old Center Antonistift have joined together under the mantel of the social foundation and opened a new attraction at the Graf-Stauffenberg platform.
In addition to discussions, you can also participate in courses there.
The social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the inner city.
Exactly said to the Graf-Stauffenberg Platz.
A new quarters office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the shopping market, receives seniors and consultants information about questions such as health insurance or services from the nursing and nursing funds.
For years, with our ambulant care service, we have found that often nursing families are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Also not rarely many services are not used in the case because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new Houselord Jutta Weigand, who is an old business manager, also responsible for the Antony Foundation and the Civil Hospital as well as for the ambulant service "Amadeus".
In addition to the discussions, the new Quartier Office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
To this end, the Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as prevention, memory training or physical therapy can be used.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis are perfectly complemented.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and reha.
"The Senior Centre for Care and Care", Heike Riedel painted, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for opening the new quarters office in the city centre see both managers especially in demographic change.
For this makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future essential.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined the invigoration celebration, the Quartier Office also dedicated to the unification of the age: "There are many events and offers on the program, and they invite to a regular consensus."
The social foundation thus contributes greatly that seniors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment.
The Quartier Office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o'clock, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o'clock and Saturday from 10 to 12 o'clock.
Structured Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is officially: after renovation work at the Fuchspark Stadium had not yet been established the date for the game FC Intracht Bamberg against the third-party Würzburger Kickers, the date was now set on 6 October.
The FC encountered Bamberg in the eight-final of the Bayerian football Totopokals against the third-party FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalised.
Played on Tuesday 6 October at the Bamberg Fouchspark Stadium.
"We are glad that we now know when the game is going about the stage, now we have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the card pre-sale that is now launched.
It's special for our team to play against a third party.
We hope, therefore, for many audiences, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special excitement.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC entranced Bamberg in 2010 by victory at the district Ligist 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and home against the regionalists 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Association 2016/2017.
The title defender is SpVgg Underhaching.
Vienna Architect Karl Mang 92-year-old died
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5, 1992, as the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcasting.
In 1922 born in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he worked as a liberal architect, but was also a teacher, writer and institute manager.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Formation.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to rebuild the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian theater museum with the establishment of the treasure chamber in the Vienna Hofburg.
Park penalty: Tim Wiese advocates the police with money
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has noticed in Bremen unfortunately.
Soccer was once, now Tim Wiese, ex-National Guards in Germany and engaged in Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
He wants to add 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years according to his own statement.
Intellectually, he did not add.
Weeds were just cutting the hair in the Bremer Interior when he saw a parking room guarder exhibiting a penalty for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Thereafter, Wiese stormed out of the business, the official insulted her and throwed her the due penalty in front of her feet, as the "picture" newspaper reports.
The city of Bremen is confirmed, but the consequences of the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still in the test," says the city of Bremen.
Only afterwards will be decided whether wheat is shown or not.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 Marihuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest-typical climate of Isla del Rey are best suited for the vibration of the marijuana plants.
For three days, Panama's authorities have ripped out the 4500 plants and burned them.
Men crawl on 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at 23.45 p.m., three young men were on their way from Bad Soden to Salmünster.
One from the group, a 17-year-old Afghane, according to the police, followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft banking station.
Three people also stayed on the site of the tank station.
One of these men now screamed to the youths and hit it with the faint in the face.
The victim suffered a nose broken down and bleeded strongly out of the nose.
When his two friends rushed and pleasantly communicated to the battleman, he first left his victim.
The injured young man was now brought home by his friends.
The offender persecuted the group with a car up to their apartment and was demonstratively passing there several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the fighter and another male person.
The victim’s face and upper ulcers were stirred in by the aid of a lap.
The injured person had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
There is only a vague description of the deceit.
One of the men was about 1.80 metres large.
The second fighter was supposed to be about 1.65 metres large and was dressed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police invite witnesses and advisers to report under telephone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
It is also a great pleasure for Samtgemeinde Bürgermeister Bernd Bormann, Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places on the country, doctors - Asendorf, however, have luck: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still on his successor in the next months with half a place.
After a reconstruction phase, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, until then investing 310000 euros in the spaces on St. Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at the first glance when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who are currently graduating in the Verdener Hospital and wanting to enter into practice the next year.
"We always had in the backhead that the Müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was done, I just called her."
The couple of Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in the future in Asendorf.
"The closeness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to know and accompany the families over the years."
As a benefit, he also sees to be his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
Still, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the two-fold family father Frank Müller has also grown up, his medical study in Hannover followed stations in several doctoral practices as well as hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently a chief physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed a leading note in the District Diepholz district and is honorably engaged in the Bruchhausen-Vilsen DRK Office.
From 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both interns, want to be a home doctor.
"The endoscopy is therefore coming out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound investigations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and we will need a speech room more.
In addition, the EDV is fully renewed.
A total amount of EUR 50000 will be granted to the Müllers in the framework of a programme of support from the district (25000 euros) and from the municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued," stresses Colonel Mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongol, about 2000 patients come into practice every quarter in Felstehausen, in the northern German average practice there are about 500.
There is another house doctor practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practitioner by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had found her, she would also have gone.
Those who visit Müller's speaking hours continue to look especially in familiar faces: take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock houses.
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, yet the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen remembers swallowing.
She feels a little woeful after the long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients still many times," says the internist.
Her husband laughs, "We have a 6000 square meter base."
"Bisher I've always pushed myself before gardening, now this could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandchildren and enjoys traveling.
Croatia: "We let the refugees go through"
"Now border controls are also high at our southern border," said internal minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The checks at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can do so as to make it "of course".
People's supply and security are at the forefront.
But be clear, "that there is a need for clear signals," said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, even beyond the Austrian-Slowenic border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian Government had previously announced that Slovenia would also want refugees to travel towards Austria and Germany and may also create corridors for refugees.
However, this interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar did not see in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely inappropriate", Slovenia will instead intensify the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary.
On the other hand, the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to lock down its limits for refugees.
"Each member of the EU must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," stressed Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried to cross the border to Tovarnik/Sid in the evening hours of the day to get over to the East Croatian border to deviate the registration.
The Croatian police could arrest her in the nearby maize fields.
According to local media, in the Croatian Tovarnik, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly encountered.
It is mainly Syrians and Afghanes, including many women and children.
Salvation services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country counts with about 4,000 refugees, said Minister of Inland Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade contests that it is to instruct people to take certain routes: "No one can we, yet we want to do so," said it.
According to the media reports, a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Sid had arrived in the early morning, further buses would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The Insasses had been on the road all night from the about 500 kilometres of Macedonian border through Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed, so the police told us we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue traveling through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually lead to the predicted movement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey-Greece-Greece-Mzedonia-Serbian Yugoslavia to a somewhat more western route.
Croatia: "According to border control"
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member has "inclusive possibilities for border control".
Strong checks are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, the EU partners have been making a good testimony to the country since then on the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border.
According to Belgrade's media reports, they had spent the last night at the border passage of Horgos, who leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain fully locked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian internal minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down on Wednesday at a local eyeschein in Horgos: he precluded the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at present.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already started to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes are recorded by Croatia.
However, the crossing of the border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war, there are still unclear mine fields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mining spacers was sent in the border region.
Börsen-Hacker: Ukrainens pay $30 million
Supranonok is supposed to have belonged to a ring of cyber criminals, which has been proposed to have repeatedly gained insight into still unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
Insider businesses should have been made on the financial markets with the information used.
In this way, the mediators reported a total of over $100 million.
"The comparison today shows that even those outside our country borders are finally captured," says the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 other accused in the case lasted.
Most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia.
The offenders should have acted from both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenic Hospital aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz, there is a governmental operation.
People do their concerns, partly fast steps, partly cozy.
They run the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at the parade square.
Keep the city trails.
Pulsating, praling life at a glorious autumn sunschein and in the middle of four large tablets each with the heading "Before I Do I Want to die."...
With this action, the Ecumenic Hospiz assistance highlighted its 20-year existence and sees itself faced with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went to the city with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josephine Lammer.
The leader of the Ecumenic Hospital Assistance is also available to the passengers for questions and discussions as well as the honorary staff.
While some a passage spontaneously grabs the crown and the sentence of "request my life", "read", "ry through the camper", "stop the war" or "not suffering long", others stay short, read, say sentences like "I am not yet" and then continue.
On the edge of the action on itself, on life, on dealing with death, there are always little discussions.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I realize that at any time the end of this world is coming for me, I can live responsible," says the director of the Diaconical Werk Mannheim, who is jointly with the Caritas Association carrier of the Ecumenic Hospital Assistance.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone on the tables wishes to communicate publicly, however, be understandable, finally it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death was still held with Tabus, so the experience of Josephine Lammer, although the Hospiz movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people.
An estimate that Angelika shares Godefroid.
The death and grief companion belongs to the honorary staff of the first hour.
Through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to engage in the death aid.
When the organic hospital assistance was sought by calling for honorary officials, it immediately reported and had been involved in the founding in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 officials - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
All of them are carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with her assignment and experiences and experiences.
"I see the life of another waiting, think it is precious and appreciative for the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant ecokumenic hospital service is free of charge and confession independence.
The financial support of the hospitals and donations of families and associations enables training and training and supervisors of the death and mourning companions.
Every two years training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be recorded on mail cards.
FedEx results mixed, financial perspectives reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier gigant reduced its profit view to a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his ground transport service.
The company also said that she plans to hire about 5,000 season workers for vacation.
At that time, FedEx announced that the company wanted to set 50,000 season workers for the holiday period last year.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year that ends in the next May, 20 cent less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected a survey from FactSet $10.84.
In spite of the price increases, the prospect is lower, at an average of 4.9 per cent, and will be effective on January 4 and despite higher allowances for soil transport of heavy and large packages collected from November.
The company said that it was still expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction, higher revenue and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is "awarding solid earnings by considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the UPS, which plans to set up 90,000 to 95.000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned 692 million dollars, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share amounted to $2.42 per share, almost behind $2.44 per share, which was foretold by Twelve of Zacks Investment Research questioned analysts.
The sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks asked analysts expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has had a decrease in international priority post, which brought the sales in his unit Express broadcast to be confirmed.
But the tree in online jumping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales increased by 29 per cent in soil transport, but the operating result was in general flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-security.
The Express Unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about one hour before opening, the FedEx shares dropped by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategen spends two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time to raise the lead interest for the first time for nearly a decade.
Threatening about them at one end of the decorated, two-stage meeting room is a wall picture of the United States.
The map is a reminder of the fact that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests ahead of all other things.
The central bank has a two-fold contract from the Congress: maximizing US employment and prices here stable.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predicting it. On Thursday, it is announced whether the US economy is ready to start, from which, for example, the short-term interest rate near zero has been decomposed since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that they grow solidly, recent turbulences on global financial markets could make the precarious Fed representatives anxious to increase this volatility by increasing the interest rate for federal loans - and it is only about a quarter of a percentage point.
"Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economy at the maker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for a presumption not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is sufficient justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which insecures the financial market itself.
About half of the economists recently asked by Bloomberg have foretold an increase in interest this week.
However, the financial markets expect a waiting for the Fed, with a key indicator, which shows only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a fall in the stock market if the fat increases the rate, unless the streets relieve the stroke by promiseing that further increase is far away.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or by 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed-Politics maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chefónom at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the fat would lift the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "should she go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
One month ago, the fat seemed to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slowly intensifying monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the spring and in the early summer that, despite liberal complaints that more economic progress would be necessary, she expected an increase in the sentence this year.
Although the creation of jobs slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate decreased to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed considers to be full employment.
Loans increases have shown signs of restoration.
And although inflation was constantly below the 2 % annual target of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher interest rates and need them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chefónom at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world fell together at the end of last month after China had devaluated its currency.
Dow Jones Industrial average decreased by more than 16% in May when investors feared that slowing the Chinese economy would threaten global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow now is almost 10% below the height of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulences affect the complex calculation when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weaknesses of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would attract the slopes at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and an earlier member of the US Notenbank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least one month to better control the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be, and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the final effect, the Fed Monetary Authority of the world has become.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The only indication of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "reduce" its monetary expansion triggered confusions around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly confused, the Fed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Her decision-finding is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that seem to be not linked to economic basic data."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is engaged in an increase in interest, quoted decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to reduce its lead rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "throughly limited apparent effects on growth in the United States", said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reverted these reductions.
The Fed should first place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as market collapse in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England for interest fixing.
The most recent turbulences do not come near this level, he said.
"It certainly doesn't want to come into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until this is changed, I do not think that it should preclude time.

Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To prepare a warm welcome to you, does not go without the commitment of countless honorary helper.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support unequivocal asylum candidates in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still enjoys teaching with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum candidate home at Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different education than in a right school.
Brazil’s paediatric society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS is trying to excite women in a shocking way about how important good diet is during breast-feeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that suck on breasts painted with representations of unhealthy foods.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research results indicate that higher calories are not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A current study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can affect the immune system negatively.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sports Hall
The municipal council Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros of expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattered for solar plant.
The plans for long-equipped tournament construction at the Bernrieder Sports Area are step-by-step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the proposed building application was unanimously settled without major discussions.
In the past, the body had decided, among other things, an application for a legal "exception" or "exemption" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was the permit for a special form of roof construction.
Therefore, a "Satteldach with non-member First and Dach Overstanding" is to be built.
The background of planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar plants: "With this we get a wonderful great southern roof together," said Mayor Joseph Steigenberger at the meeting.
The "exemption" was again about the density to be less than ten degrees, for the energetic reasons - unlike the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "exemption" was therefore needed because the construction plan does not allow "exceptions" in relation to the roofing, with the Bernried municipal council in general rather restrictively in the case of exemption applications.
However, the tournament construction is not a returning project: "We do not create a predecessment," says Steigenberger.
The tournament building at the Sports Center is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Approximately 2.3 million euros are incurred at costs.
Aids are expected from school and broad sports promotion.
In the next step of the procedure, the building request for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now submitted to the Council of Land for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The hospital Peißenberg is to be closed earlier than planned – that is 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes a new doctoral director at the Hospital Schongau.
The station as well as the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the Circle, which Landrat Andrea Jochner-Weiß confirmed.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board and will be taken on Wednesday 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The vast majority should move with fishermen and the remaining internal station to Schongau.
The rooms are available.
The employees who are not able to join after Schongau are to be offered a job in Weilheim, so Jochner-White.
Employees are informed about the plans.
The change has triggered the announcement of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a doctoral director of the Schongauer Hospital since the beginning of the year and now switches to a private practice near the hospital.
According to Jochner-White, the name "Fisher" came into the game with the question who was willing to take the lead from 1 October and switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this meant in any case a "revaluation" and a widening of the offer in the "Internal Medicine", said Jochner-White.
Fisher is a specialist for heartbreakers and defibrillators.
Algau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological disorders at the internal station.
For the next two years, fishermen with their team, if the supervisory council agrees to lead both houses, until next year the former hospital of the Buttonship, which still has 35 beds, will be finally closed in Peißenberg after nearly 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018 when the current renovation at the Hospital Weilheim has been completed.
Land adviser Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, found rumours that the house that is in possession of the Bundesknappschaft will be used as accommodation for asylum webers in the future.
"I quit it." As the property continues, Jochner-White couldn't say that there are several considerations.
There is a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What couldn't happen to us, such an opportunity does not come back," said fishermen about the quasi transfer to the lech, which was "positive and very understanding" by the employees.
There has not been a real perspective for the house where fishermen have worked as chief for more than 30 years.
He had been asked by Mr Schongauer's colleagues to take over the posts of the physician director.
The Peißenberg Hospital (only 100 beds) has been constantly threatened by closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, such as surgery and birth aid.
The handballers of the Rhine-Neckar lions are required tonight at the Bergische HC at 20.15 o'clock.
The Bundesliga table leader is in Wuppertal the clear favorite, but there is no reason for excess.
During the last season, the BHC badeners were dealing with a painful defeat and have something to do there.
Hunting in case with two injured people at Pratau
Two tractor drivers have been severely injured by shots during their maize in the Tuesday afternoon.
During the Aberntens on a Maisfeld at Pratau (Landkreis Wittenberg) several hunters were in operation, as the police announced.
After a shooting charge, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered severe injuries and was brought to hospitals.
Just how the accident could happen, it was unclear at first.
Criminal police detected.
Missed 16-year-olds from Rhine-Pfalz victims of violence
A suspect has led the police to the body of 16-year-olds missing from Rhineland-Pfalz since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to kill the youths and to throw their body into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old who has been missing from Rhine-Pfalz since Saturday has been a victim of violence.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen at Kaiserslautern, as state prosecutor and police announced on Wednesday.
As a suspicion, a 20-year-old who was also arrested on the evening of the day of the day of the service, who claimed the fact and led the mediators to the foundation of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed in the morning after a autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the mediators first shot on personal items of the victim.
In the case of interviews in the family's friends and acquaintances of the missing ones, there was finally a misunderstanding against the 20-year-olds.
The suspicious killer then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen where the body was found.
The arrested confessed the authorities in the police hearing that killed the 16-year-olds and put the body into the channel.
The 20-year-old should be brought to the prisoner on Wednesday, the mediators put him to death.
Information on the closer circumstances of action is intended to provide further investigations.
Refugees need accommodation: study warns against casualties
The situation on the German housing market is excited.
Even more and more refugees are looking for a payable stay.
The pressure on the housing market grows.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution fights on the German housing market have long started.
With the coming refugees and workers from the EU, more and more people are pressing on a market that is already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with income weak citizens for the last affordable apartments.
In order to cover the demand for affordable apartments, 400,000 new units must be built by 2020 each year.
This is the result of a study on behalf of the Association "Social Wohnungsbau".
For comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
That's how 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live asylum seekers in an initial accommodation.
Many then join the housing market and enter the long snakes in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Statistical Federal Office, less than half of all asylum candidates lived last year for rent.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only the rise in refugees.
The study also constitutes significant negligence in housing policy in recent years.
Germany has a dwelling deficit, which increases from year to year.
Currently, there were some 770,000 living units in the balloon areas, complaining to Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults remained unwillingly longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flat on the housing market.
In the large cities, the number of square metres per head was once again decreased in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Association of Social Apartments proposes a restart.
New incentives are aimed at reinforcing social housing.
Thus, the basic labour tax could be excluded and the basic tax for eligible housing would be temporarily suspended.
Moreover, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The Promoting Programme for Refugee Accommodation by the State Bank KfW is already well attached to cities and communities.
A good week after the start had already been received more than half of the EUR 300 million available on Monday evening with EUR 184 million.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free leads: Croatia and Slovenia settle the corridor
After Hungary, there is virtually no more passion, then more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia.
Zagreb announced to grant the transit to the north of Slovenia without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to agree with the neighbouring country Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After cutting off the Serbian-ungarian border, hundreds of refugees have broke up to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people have reached the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television broadcaster TL.
Hungary had locked down its border for refugees in the morning.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, also make regular asylum procedures in Hungary practically overflowing.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
The Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explained: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country Croatia in the morning.
Most of the media reports were reported from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both with the bus and taxes to the Serbian border town of Sid.
As soon as they arrived, they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia.
Although the refugees are not at the Croatian-Serbian border, they are not on border grounds.
There are other dangers for the borderlines: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mining spacers are now supposed to create a safe passage quickly.
However, after the closure of the border, there are little more refugees after Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people in charge.
Shortly before the end of Monday, there had been 9380.
The new Hungarian laws entail the overcome and harmfulness of the border line as a crime.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern border town of Szeged.
The judges threaten prison sentences up to five years and the dismissal from the country.
According to the Immigration Authority, in the new Transitzones, which were set up at the border, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday, of which almost all - 93 - were the most important transition to Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would have stayed there.
However, in practice no one has the prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum candidates should be pushed down there.
Just a few hundred refugees were gathered before the "Transitzone" in Röszke.
Workers started cleaning it up in Rüszke.
They collected the waste that tens of thousands of people had left on the streets over the past weeks.
Sperrgitter was degraded and one of the recording camps in the border site was reconstructed.
No one wanted to express himself to this reconstruction.
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the border between Serbia and Hungary is closed.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, according to government statements, around the 20,000 migrants remained in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Traffic from there to Germany was stopped on the morning on the instruction of German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly met.
Citizen's championship crossed the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people stood with travel bags at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had surprisingly stopped the railway with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee stream, it was concluded in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the radiators along with two other helpers and their cars over the border to the Nahe Passau.
Before we had expelled the undesirable guests, with Jause and Drinks.
We just said we'd take her to Passau with the car.
"This was of course for us," said Stadler in the OÖN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man could not take it to give a generous donation - 100 euros for the firearm.
"That's a great pleasure for us," said Staler.
On Sunday evening, train passengers in Wels went about from a ICE to a regional train towards Passau in order to try over the border after the short-term announcement that train traffic was suspended to Germany.
However, the regional train was posted before the border in Wernstein at Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The Bridge Festival associated with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, the day before a two-bridge race sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from New Church.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends us more Thousands is a logical result of a shine-holy policy:
Instead of helping immediately in the Röszke camp in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has taken the position of the Hungarian Government into the darkness circle of Nazism.
Sadly, this policy is not just those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "golfed land", which they have invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to create human-worthy conditions for protective seekers in view of the persistent flows of refugees and the nearing winter.
And it will be even greater - maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Conrad looking for 35.000 winter festivities
Conrad has all hands to do with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to have weight in his word.
The government has used the former powerful raiff ice banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording centre of Traiskirchen has already been handled by Konrad.
"We don't have homeless people in Traiskirchen anymore," he reported about his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived to Austria on Monday had also taken place without a big wrestle, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance".
On the other hand, the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a "crisisy situation".
Overall, Conrad calculates a need of 85,000 quarters in the year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 will provide the countries, 15,000 of the covenant.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a facade without soil," said Konrad.
He has already talked with the Heads of the State.
They would have assured him to create quarts for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria, it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP Mandataer supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, which will clarify how the Church will help.
Great expectations are also set by the asylum coordinator in the ORF action "Helves like us".
On the platform, individuals can offer uncomplicated accommodation.
In addition, you are hoping for hotels that are empty in winter.
Conrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation yesterday as "very high".
In times of emergency, quartier donors may not have to comply with a certain height of the towel holders or size of the upper lights.
For a time-limited period, "note standards" must apply.
Conrad justifies his experience, in contrast to the Ministry of Interior, that he is more successful in accommodation.
I am an elderly Lord, who is not unfairly told in the face.
The force of persuasion is his most important weapon.
Conrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they explained themselves.
Your staff want to increase them to three to four.
The own quarterly search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the approval.
Linz demands a better breakdown
First, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment because it is currently possible to undertake the affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further locations should be examined for their viability.
Criticism has been exercised by the head of the city in the division of refugees within the state of the country.
Other districts also have to contribute here.
Seehofer: "Grenses are not locked"
In a longer telephone with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Head of State Joseph Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday the further action in the refugee question.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not locked down.
The resurrection of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the appropriate border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Pühringer once demanded greater solidarity in the issue of refugees from the other EU Member States.
The fact that Austria now also brings back controls at its borders is "a logical consequence" for Pühringer from the process of the Germans.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general sanation of the "New Werft" in the Linzer Industrial Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the stocked IT Group S&T has been drawn up, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be hired to young innovative technology companies.
"In IT the wise heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T-Chef Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Werft and also acquiring those later.
From the beginning, S&T will cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser promises: "The next runtastic is just a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Association (FFG).
The building is defeated by Linz AG for 60 years at S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters remaining area in the building are already rented, for more 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second business in the Arcade
In the new shop, Furla handbags are at the heart.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to lay a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the Taubenmarkt-Arkade had to postpone this project in a short time: finally, she has grown in the form of another business place.
In the Furla-Shop toward the business where they sell bags, bags, shoes and walls of different manufacturers, everything turns around women's handbags of the Furla brand, money boxes are to have from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday, the new shop has been in operation.
There were several weeks before rebuilding.
"I have thought for a long time if I should open another store," says Breit.
The decision was decisive, among other things, that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also used by the idea of a own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the large room of Linz who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been put widely by her mother in the cheek.
I do most when something develops and I can show new trends at loose prices.
Why such a woman is putting in dish when looking at a beautiful handbag, the professional woman can't answer with the last safety.
Maybe it's because a nice pocket evaluates every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
This property also combines some with the billionaire that wants to become the US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he expresses himself hostilely, is dealing with journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. President's office is strongly disturbing the electoral struggle.
And cut off well.
This is also registered in the Palestinian Cold City, where the grandparents of the real estate miliardary originate.
The New Yorker with the hair frisur is a concept of many in the Winzerdorf on the wine road.
Some in the 1200 resident place are related to him over -twenty corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the election mode.
Simone Wendel, the calf town, turned a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this somewhat exciting, but they are not deeply impressed in their calf cities," says Simone Wendel.
The infant calf town has turned a amusing documentary film about the place and its famous sprayers, including the Ketchup family Heinz, alongside Trump.
Trump, which is not known for modestness, also comes to the word in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it to the king of the hearts there.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, but also tends to believe that Trump is "non a little grandmouse", Wendel says.
Suddenly, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the surroundings is "The Brulljesmacher" - to Hochdeutsch: the Angler, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the Adler.
The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold graves in the United States.
Basestein of the real estate group were the first property purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return permanently to home failed to the Bavarian state of which the Pfalz was then.
He did not record Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Pfalzic History and People's Science, Roland Paul, had explained to the start of the film.
Trump is the grandson of a "illegal immigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly spoken of mexican immigrants in the United States and asked for the construction of a border wall to scare illegal immigrants.
"As the polter is, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative Trumps ("The Grandma was a born tromp, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The winner in the retirement sees the American rather distant, "he's always so exciting."
Does he think Trump's coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared for Kallstadt."
The pensionist Veronika Schramm mentioned as some Kallstadter that a descendant of the Heinz family spended something for the church normals when he visited.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She finds it better if he doesn't win the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if it's good".
If those who had spoken in the United States at the time of his grandfather would have been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzer daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My President isn't," she says.
And: "The grapes will also be mature without the President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has seen 12,000 cinemas, also in the United States, awakens interest.
The oberbayerian municipality of Ramsau at Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice-President at the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800 inhabitant drorf received the award for gentle tourism in the Berchtesgaden National Park on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "Bergsteiger Doors".
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding awards.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have not more than 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be identified as a protection area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews despite the attempts of Nine to take the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurry to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has not resulted in any major shifts in the reviews for Today.
The breakfast show by Nine was presented by the capital of the state when Malcolm Turnbull made the storm of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderns David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance seemed to be no matter for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 spectators at the five main cities, compared with Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slightly increase in the ratings for Monday (317,000) and the last Tuesday (283,000), but its number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators of 314,000 with Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change concern these morning men more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thanks for the review!
Written by TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015
The great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently concealed father, who decided to leave with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million spectators.
Critics had asked if Thomson could carry a hit show Solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday night answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million spectators and easily hit The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on the evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new Quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, revealed an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires hot seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia achieved 520,000 spectators, and in the second half an hour, 720,000 set.
Hot-Seat averages 620,000.
The fall in the quotas of the second evening of The Chase Australia will convince Nine that the hot seat will finally be carried out at 17:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars minute that did not manage to overturn the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Mystery revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unawarely revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor, was concealed in the biggest secret.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up if she is the one who has received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before getting out of three two, you may accidentally have indicated who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have quit lyrics about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambitiousness, family values and positive attitude as a reason why they would like to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked, "If you don't, who should receive Wood's last Rose?", their answers could become a gambling man who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both called fast - except for themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energy, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought this throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on earth, it makes so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be good suited as a couple.
From her viewpoint, Mackay said that last week the visit made her clear that Wood could be "the One".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unreservedly put on him," she said.
And when she was asked who to choose wood if she didn't, she was ridiculous.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls as well - it's a difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is radiated on Wednesday 19:30 p.m. to ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49er and trainer Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game, when he lost an angel as the Aussie-Rugby Liga conversion on his first point return on Tuesday at 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point return and also to the running game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game.
Instead of painting his smokes before the rest of the team through the mills, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also officially strengthened Hayne at his press conference after the game.
The 49er sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his paused catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fits at a point restored by Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game
It was certainly not the start, the Hayne and his massive Australian success for his NFL debut had hoped.
Hayne left after the fumble floating the game field and later told the Australian radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"This was a thing that happens now, you only care for the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the cutter to his Origin Debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in-golal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posting it on his instagram.
Elton John and the Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the grooms
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested on a Siberian wheelfield with arms force.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was sentenced, his oil company occupied Yukos and suspended its democratic efforts.
The free voters demand the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees.
Head of party and group Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW herd clause in Großwallstadt against a severe crisis at Bayern's schools if there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to protect schools from collaps," said Aiwanger.
"If so, we will get rejections in the Bavarian educational system."
The free voter's country day group meets in the sub-frank municipality until Friday.
In fact, other main topics were intended.
But the record number of refugees is now dominating the free voter team.
"Of course, the subject of asylum will overlay the clause," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger demanded the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslavia war in the nineties.
"This is not how it goes, we have to do with the causes," said the Free Chairman.
Rejected asylum candidates want to move the free choosers as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum charges: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW-Chapter criticized that several federal countries are not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal countries throughout the world."
"Bayern's leaving, others aren't."
"There we have to become more actionable."
However, the country policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Cultus Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot attempt "Medium level plus" in which a extension of the high school level is tested from three to four years – the result will take nine years to the abitural.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The theme G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW-Chef.
We demand freedom of choice for all the gymnasias who want to do so.
Free ride at G9 everywhere it is desired.

4 people killed after police shooting rubber shots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal, after the police shot rubber shots in a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, one official said on Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi District, about 175 miles west of the capital of Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of district officials, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before they took back to rubber shots.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber shots used, which are known that they can kill, but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative, apparently produced such a high rate of death.
The controversy was the last violent protest in the southern part of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces formed under the proposed new Constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want to have a own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent disputes since the 10th century.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial topic in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators speeded up the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.
Construction area planned in the city
The property at Emder Youth Center Old Post is to be rebuilt.

Emden - The city of Emden wants to sell an area of about 4000 square meters in direct neighborhood to the Youth Center Old Post.
The preparations for this are currently ongoing.
It is planned to use the area for a mixture of trade, trade and housing.
You are waiting for appropriate offers, says the city.
Which investor is in question is not clear yet.
Accordingly, no contracts have been concluded.
The city of Emden had purchased a part of the property located on the Ringstraße / Ecke Große Straße a few months ago and had to cut off the building on it.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for holiday home accommodation at the Small Sea at Emden are acceptable.
The investor presented public plans for the project for the first time.
Several concerns continue to be worried - they fear the sale of their free-seaugium
For months, after closed doors had been negotiated, buried, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home accommodation near Emden are on the table.
The interested person, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented his plans for the first time publicly in the Emder Council's City Development Committee on Monday evening.
This point was originally on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP Group, which prevented the investor and the administration of mystery, Ralf Behrends went from the System-Bau Business Management to the Offensive: "We have not yet a answer to all questions," he said to the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all rumors now.
The project is about 10 to 12 million euros of expensive for months in the debate.
Heavy reactions among seaboats owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details for the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, seaboth owner and board member in the Representative of the applicants, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is a giant clue that overthrows all other buildings".
He also fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would grow strongly through the planned size of the plant: "There must be all bus charges to calculate it," said Schulz.
However, what happens exactly on the well a large hectare of the former restaurant is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we must have a concluding concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Zwillings-Nachwuchs at Gorillas in Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo rejoices over the growth of his Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian produced twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in Gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years left and had also been in Frankfurt in 1967, it says of the zoo.
The gender of the newborn Gorilla twins is not yet firm, as mother Dian has so far kept her close to the body.
First, the "picture" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for Cyclon south of the Cape Verde Islands
On Tuesday, the US National Hurricane Center predicted a wide printing system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern Cape Verde islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical storm in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, such as in the middle of the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, has also a 60 percent potential to form a tropical turbine storm in the next two days, adding the weather experts located in Miami.
Google starts double spenden campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL. O) announced a double-spenden campaign to spend $11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations as they flee from the war broken and armed countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach in the announcement of the donation call on his blog.
Rata Masoud, a Google employee who has fled from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"There were many dark trains and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I had luck.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations are made to four non-profit organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants: doctors without limits, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations are doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugee to 11 million dollars.
Europe has been faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, mainly caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has distributed more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya devastated by war.
Report by Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing of Christian Plumb
For mildly overweight diabetic patients, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study.
It is too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-chirurgic treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote a lead article on the new study in JAMA surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, adipositas operations have proven to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are sickly fatty with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18,5 and 24,9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered fatty.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of adipositas surgery - magenbypass and stomach swallowing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, the BMI remained in those who received non-chirurgic diabetes treatments approximately at 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% of those who suffered from diabetes were completely dissolved and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, diabetes was completely resolved only at one percent and partly only for about two percent.
In addition, the results in the control of blood pressure, triglyceride and the "bad" LDL-cholesterin "in general were better in the 'operative' group," the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from approximately 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical treatment group, however, it remained stable at approximately 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved haemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gas tractory group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved larger decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%) and marked a complete overcome of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show any survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years – compared to a group that tried conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in survival in the surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said without increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have gathered these genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies to fattyness and diabetes, it is really difficult to reverse."
Love story plays in Hunsback
It is a topic that is currently increasing attention in Belletristic: A young woman, unwanted and unwanted at schooltimes, after years meets the sword of her youth, and he is in love with her.
Likewise in the recently published novel "We are not like this" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the story of love, the Roman should be especially interesting for Hunsrücker readers, because he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The chief author has grown up in Langweiler and is pleased that she could set her home place a literary monument.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not take up all refugees, said Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis was in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the country of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents under the given circumstances.
He also stressed that the Western European countries' response to the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama and Austria had praised the efforts of the German and Austria to tackle the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"In order to take care of several thousand refugees, it is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and real development can be created, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and showed that the U.S. violent reaction drew into a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my compassion in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in violencelessness.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
4-fold increase in intake of hand disinfectants by children in the last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow strong alcoholic hand disinfectants, says Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of intake of hand disinfectants increased in children under 12 years reporting to poison control centres from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.17 in 2014.
"Children gets more and more to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of social media.
Videos on YouTube show how youths drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Youths claim to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouth water in order to get a harder drink.
Young children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with earth beer, grape and orange dust that are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol anywhere.
Especially in small children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Gift Not Call Center at the Hospital of the University of Kansas, Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let whisky stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants in the range of children, and if children come there, then it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who recently had taken four syringes of dufting hand disinfectants in school, was brought to an emergency record.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which is legally considered to be drunk in adults, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, a emergency doctor who treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah laughed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency record.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital on signs of brain-trauma, as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had shot her head, said Ritchey.
"It was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been dead for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand disinfectants outside the child's range.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died women after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Employers of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a fatal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, recorded as an active substance.
In January, three of the fourth class students in the state of New York planned to poison her "general" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom," reports a police report.
The teacher is high-grade allergic to hand disinfectants and banned her from her room.
The police regarded the puzzled plan as "smuggle" and referred discipline to the school authority.
Villingen swingings: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been easily injured in the event of an upcoming accident on the cross-spange between the Nordring and the Herden.
A 60-year-old truck driver travelled on the cross-spange towards the Circle Transport Industry area and noticed too late that two precursor vehicles had stopped on the circuit.
As a result, he sprayed with his truck into the hill of an Audi and pushed this vehicle on a Ford Fiesta on the front.
The accident-related vehicles caused damages of about 10,000 euros, the police announced.
The 33-year-old Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be pulled off.
Smoking: No Disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place, but he will turn it again.
Hearts will fight SFA for the accusation of Neilson and Warburton will be cautiously in January-new commitments that could destroy the unit of the frame
Dons increase leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's eleven meters in the first half-time, Aberdeen gave a tough victory over Hamilton in Pittotre, so that the dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths play Gade about Disharmony down
There are rumours about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffith's. This suggested that he and his teammates are not under increased control because they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in the Scottish football slows down the Netherlands - de Boer
The former Rankers Medelfield player and former National Player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fan's interest in Celtic has lost, since there is no title rivality with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently a ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they do not show peaks of Celtic games more and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm gonna turn things around, Deila swords.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League, the defeat followed against 10-men from Aberdeen, who now stand clearly at the top of the table with five points.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel that way - but we have to go on.
We really need, really the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
Now being together is so important.
Warburton with caution on January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which suggested that he reflected some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful to sign new accesses and urges him not to interfere with the unit of the Ibrox chader.
The ex-chair of Brentford said: "The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players who come in the summer have this season time to integrate what you saw with our own group during this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with withdrawal instructions
Swansea storm Miku, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, suggested that he could withdraw when his contract expires at the Swans.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an indignant knee for two years and has not managed the departure from Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA slaughter for Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1, when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the red card of the defender was later revoked - the third red card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson remains in what he said and persists: "I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffith's sword to avoid Tynecastle
The imperfect Hibee was reproved after he admitted to sing a song with stupid texts about Ex-Heart's player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a knee in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the storm said, adding: "It's safe to say that I don't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-Management
Simon Donnelly maintains that the board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to rotate things - but confesses that the defeat must end on the game field.

We'll bring the boys back on the street," said Donnelly.
McInnes' happy to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to struggle desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh successive Liga victory, which brought them a front of five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys elf meters in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in pocal games or bodies that haven't even won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it increases totally in the United Kingdom.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged in 164,000 in the period May to July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above 5.5 per cent in the UK, as the figures of the National Statistics Office (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12 000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2 612 000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a number above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Trunkeners Disrupted the Expiry
As security staff could not satisfy the situation, the employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepperspray, the officials were able to capture the killers.
A atemalcoholetest showed 0.89 promilles in a 16-year-old.
The grown-up was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promilles and first stayed in guard.
Why I will be witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Sometime later today, except in a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I will sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January on his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
When the day came closer, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and since more applications are available than places, a macabulary lottery takes place to decide who is chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected, he will watch it emotionally.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I developed my own relationship with phones over the months and a visit of two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison officers say that I can't be a witness and a journalist, so it won't allow me to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of Twitter to give up my inpartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it, and you get access.
I'm complaining about her.
She admitted that she could "it could've been better", but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he would.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks the public work will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of Podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details here.
I can't surely say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters that you can turn to.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after moist police persecution persecuted to come from the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt of a man from Perth to hang off the police was unreasonable when he was in sucking and mobing water, just a few metres away from a police officer who tried to persuade him to return to the shore.
The police of Canning Vale were called on Tuesday for a house peace-breaking event in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspects, he tried to escape them towards the Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water-- and said, "I don't come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiated".
"Sometimes people do fun things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castile.
Mastership football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins took his car into the graves to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy him out and threatened to quit race sports
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his seats last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Division of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were carrying out a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai because of a renntage treatment, the last strhhalm in Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what was best for race sports and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt tupfer test at Lidari, which he cannot explain.
He had retained 18 months because of the spying plans and didn't want it to "like too high-hanging grapes."
"I had planned not to say anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around the raised head, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I don't do that, then I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
I have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Before, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy out his chair.
"Ten months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - which I will be named when I was asked - and offered him an employment in my places to provide information about what I do in my seats," said Moody on Racing.com.
Looks like you think I'm a traitor.
If that's the case, they should certainly take their noses because they failed to take me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still today.
Should that bring me to the view that it will be personal?
Has the RVL acted foolishly and may it be that people outside trainers are responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I say lets them think about it now.
But I've arrived at the point I don't care about, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will exercise pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration level of the trainer has built up with the long-term cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late Scratching led him to say that he could "cast his license over the table."
Moody, the best known by his preparation of the unwritten master Black Caviar, referred to the Renntags Treatment Rule "lasty," after a packing of mud or tone had been placed on the horse legs, which consumed the rules.
"It's against the rules of race sport.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
"One of my employees wrongly put mud on the leg.
It could've been like that last night.
It could've been like that all day yesterday.
But it was like that on the race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the pack on the day of the race. A study of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all understand that we need rules, but here you have gone too far," said Moody.
Man arrested by driver flight
The police arrested a man in the weekend after a collapse with a bicycle driver and then a rider flight in Cobram.
The bike driver was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray-Valley motorway.
The police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday a 50-year-old man from Nathalia of the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of driver flight and non-resident assistance and other traffic defects.
The bicycle driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in the hospital. He is in a stable state.
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy struggles against rivals because of claims to ring fighting
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy described criticism on the tackling of his players as "Agenda-Setting" by two premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the arbitrators allowed the storm players "Ringkampe" with his team during the high storm victory in the Qualifying Final in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Bronco's Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly hidden note of the storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "muster example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland are not "to good" in the rings.
Bellamy defended his team's gratitude and said she was focused on her "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers at his team was confident to him, since it meant that they were worried about being hit by the storm team.
"This appears again - I haven't heard that Trent Robinson talked about ring fights when they hit us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything throughout our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Thanksles a real focus, and that has brought us the trend turn.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. He is probably not used to lose, so it was a little shock for him.
It's already funny how this appears again and again at this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "speaking football" and reminded his mentor that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "saving" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he would take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we consider as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build greater confidence because they say these things because they are a little worried about having to play against us.
They probably didn't think about us six weeks ago when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the Broncos game against Cowboys.
The game of Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't viewed it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two further attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are pauses and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the playtables.
If they mention us, it means we will meet on them in a phase.
The Storm team is free on this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday night at the pre-final in the AAMI Park. The ticket sale starts from the next Tuesday morning.
Serbia with $200,000 deposit by drug installation
A man who may threaten a lifelong penalty because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Solay, who came from South America over Vanuatu and invested in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed in the course of the morning and later in the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilos of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible lifelong penalty for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole quantity and that in the café could have been for an harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his place of residence in the criminal proceedings.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a deposit of $200,000 as security together to reach his release.
"After reading the egotical statements of the two persons, it is clear that the edition of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But this alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against warranty, under the conditions that he leaves his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police every day and holds himself on an outgoing lock of 18:00-06:00.
Unfall on A5 at Karlsruhe: Chairhouse breaks apart
In the event of a trip accident with three cars on the car 5 at Karlsruhe, a truck driver has been severely injured on Tuesday night.
Two of the three involved trucks had bremsed in the direction of Basel before a permanent construction site.
The third driver noticed it too late and never tried to deviate at the last moment to the left, as the police announced.
The driver's house of the accidental cause was completely ripped apart.
The driver was severely injured into a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was fully locked over six hours to 2 o'clock.
There was a damage of EUR 122,000.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lock pedophiles to send pictures
A pedofiler used the phone of an 11 - year - old girl to demand pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this slept, logged in to an online messaging service, from which he received a number of unpleasant pictures of children sent by another user.
The girl later wake up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web investigations that used terms to search for unfair images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the official that he had done it because it would lead to "Pedophile on the Internet" and then "foresee to be a policeman to scare them".
The state lawyer Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but he said that it had happened because he wanted to be a policeman to scare Pedophile.
He was asked for his conversation with the unknown person who sent the pictures to him and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to lock her.
He said he was sick in his head when he drinks, and he said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was at the cittering and crying.
She also saw the unpleasant pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, said guilty in the sense of the accusation of taking unfair pictures of children on 14 June last year, having violated the obligations on 25 January of this year and not appeared before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg should not appear in the register of sexual criminals, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" should be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael moved the judgment until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted a warranty in this case, but was held in investigation due to hearings on other remaining cases.
He was still included in the list of sexual criminals before the date of judgment.
Schleuser weighs on small crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are taken off the major control points at the German-Austria border.
Many Schleusers made the people increasing in smaller border crossings because of fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, a speaker of the Federal Police said.
Along the border flow of Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been encountered in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side through bridges and stauwehre.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to registration.
At the Münchner Hauptbahnhof, after Bundespolizei statements, much more refugees were again encountered on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
One speaker said in the morning, only until 8 o'clock arrived about 700 people in the capital of the country.
After the re-introduction of controls at the German-Eastern border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Explorer of Tropenstorm "Henry" in the southwest
Meteorologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a deep pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) announced in Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the runner of the "Henry" tropical tower, which had moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days.
Heavy storms and thunders are expected mainly in baths.
According to DWD, until Thursday's early is also expected in the Black Forest, on the Swiss Alb and in the ground sea circle with soils from 60 to 90 kilometres.
Thus, on Friday the sun can be looked longer.
The mass makes it: Every two years, the autobuilders on the IAA show their news.
In 2015, it is especially possible to use the compact cars that are currently specially selling.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked: About 28.1 percent of the new authorisations, according to the power station (KBA) alone in August, fell to this segment.
This also reflects on the IAA (public stance 17 to 27 September).
Between all futuristic concept vehicles and new superclass and luxury cars, many new compact models are presented this year.
One of the largest premieren for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be with the traders in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chef Karl-Thomas Neumann on the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order to sell the volume model well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive for it.
Opel offers an entrance below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 Euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4 leather engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
The hessen also offer further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW//200 PS, including three-cylinder benzines for the first time.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only five doors.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the combi, which is already seen on the IAA.
And what's going on next to the Astra on the IAA to new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane to race.
At the fair, the Mégane is exclusively seen as a five-door door in a conventional and emphasised sports GT version.
He comes to trade early next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
The Nissan delegate wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
The compact infiniti fits its swinged lines fully into the design line of the brand.
The basic model will get a petrol engine with a performance of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
In the offer, however, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premieres in Frankfurt.
Offers will be the model with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1,0-liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum speed is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
Baleno's sale start in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but roundly renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble citroën delegator primarily put hand on the front party: here the refrigerator grill was resigned and the modified lighters equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system has been modernised, the number of buttons is reduced by a touchscreen and the first time Apples CarPlay is integrated.
In addition, a series of revisions and new variants, such as the refreshed Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI, are added to the IAA in the compact class.
JVA Berlin Tile: Five square meters of cell are human unworthy
The Federal Constitutional Court has given the right to an ex-captain of the Judgment Department of Tegel, which had been dwelling in a too small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation when they are placed in small cells.
This has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, they can even hope for money if they were only a few days locked in the too tight rooms (Act.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
A former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: he was placed in a single cell with about five square meters of soil area in the Berlin-Steuerungsanstalt between June and November 2009; the toilet was not spatially separated.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer’s information, was now relocated to a larger cell.
His official arrest complaint because of the unworthy arrest conditions against the country of Berlin failed.
However, the Constitutional Judges lifted the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and rejected the case to re-examine it.
You see the man's human dignity hurt.
Chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
Although, for legal reasons, for the period concerned, only a few days of imprisonment for compensation is essential, it was said that there is a compensation claim.
Otherwise, "a shame of personality's legal protection would be fearful".
The Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of money compensation.
In the past, the Constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
So they spoke to a prisoner only in April because he was naked into a cell.
According to a decision of 2011, the multiple use of a cell without separate toilets is unworthy.
In addition, Karlsruhe confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had confirmed a human invaluable accommodation to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The then applicant had been in a similar cell in the case of Karlsruher every day over three months between 15 and 21 hours.
The Berlin prisons have also come into the headlines in recent weeks because of the lack of staff.
Consequently, prisoners are repeatedly incorporated 23 hours, which increase aggressivity, even fighting it should have already come because of the excited situation.
According to the Legal Press Office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied because of a lack of growth, 19 are supposed to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We'll do this"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What is the matter with Germany?
About 800 000 asylum candidates will come to Germany this year, according to the Federal Ministry's forecasts, according to Vice-Chancker Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take up a million refugees.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do it".
What comes to Germany is the following overview.
According to different forecasts between 350000 (Setting of the Federal Ministry of Building) and 400000 (Setting of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built (250000 apartments).
However, the lack of living room is dramatic, especially in the case of affordable rent objects: annually, 60000 to 80000 social housings fall out of the rent price commitment and refugees will also apply to these particularly favourable apartments.
Consequently, Bundesbauminister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is too little from the Pestel Institute's view: 80 000 social housings must be created annually and the covenant must invest a support of 6.4 billion a year.
Researchers and Federal Ministry agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing buildings.
According to estimates of the Institute for Labour and Professional Research, 55 percent of the refugees in Germany may be recruited on a long-term basis.
However, refugees in Germany would not have been systematically asked for their qualifications to help them start, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, for the integration of refugees, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, to appreciation in the host company, but also to the self-value sense of immigrants, says Migrantsforscher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn in Germany: the ban on the work of refugees to recognise work.
While there was previously a ban on work for asylum candidates of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the obligation to residence, the asylum candidates were limited to a place of residence.
In society, the majority of the views that refugees should be able to access the labour market has, also due to the lack of professionals, been seen.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge.
There is still no sufficient offer for general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most frequently communicated by personal contacts.
Consequently, the construction of networks is, according to Thränhardt, the king's path to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents are giving their children to the Kitas, estimated to be 10 to 15 percent: "For the decompulsed parents it is only very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
To convince the family from the advantages of the Kita, the administration distributes handsuits in different languages.
If the need for educators increases strongly by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example by allowing more professional schools.
In the countries, students without German knowledge are prepared for education in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no lack in them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin School Administration.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no country forbids asylum candidates or patience students - the only exception has been Berlin until now, but interior Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Students' refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
For refugees with a residence permit or tolerance will no longer receive benefits under the asylum application law when they start a study.
In principle, the latter do not get buffalo because they do not fall under the circle of the buffalo-right persons.
Told refugees must have lived in Germany for four years in order to be Bafög's right, from 1 January 2016, this span is shortened to 15 months.
However, these financial gaps must also be closed, Staffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Work demands.
The students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, for many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should successively grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and further develop the existing state church law into a new state-religions relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic Welfare Association, which cares professionally for the newcomers.
Rights also include obligations.
In this way, Islam's representatives must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and to allow it for certain controls.
This also includes the willingness to act harshly against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to bear such conflicts in Germany "had immediately their right to live here, in Germany, rejected," he said in the Bayrian radio.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more than today a subject of society.
This will also have to change the majority society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more urgent.
Although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for a few decades a anti-discriminatory body and a general law on equality.
But it learns very slowly as the NSU murder series showed that police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motif.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interested groups of non-white Germans have long demanded and what international agreements, such as the Antiracism Convention, require Germany, must be reality in the next years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - to the benefit of all.
In general, Germany has been able to provide medical care for the expected refugees, says doctor President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As for man power and capacities, we can do this," he said to the day mirror.
However, additional money had to flow into the system.
In order to avoid engpasses, Montgomery calls on all admissions to deliver health cards immediately during registration.
Services provided could later be calculated with the federal countries.
And for the long term it would be highly questionable to eat so many people with the limited performance catalogue foreseen by the asylum application law.
Otherwise, the doctors are especially making the language barriers.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated, migrants are less informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, including in medical practices, the interpreter costs must be taken, she asks.
However, many refugees would have been helped with more general medical approaches in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and youths are about HIV-intelligence.
But with some other disease pictures, German doctors came clear from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite seizures or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as for the medical deficiency, the refugees may even be in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed educational system, many refugees are even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they have to demonstrate their qualifications and may re-examine tests.
At least half of the refugees arrived in Germany, according to the Federal Psychotherapist Chamber (BPtK) are psychologically ill: most people suffer from posttraumatic burden disorders or depressions.
In particular, refugee children are injurious, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study published by TU Munich demonstrates that every five Syrian refugee son arrives traumatized in Germany.
Persons who are ill at posttraumatic stress disorders are suffering from so-called flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, heart rhythms, and death anxiety.
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong scaryness and emotional diveness.
In order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic, early treatment is required, Munz explained.
However, only four percent of the psychiatricly ill people have received psychotherapy.
Although psychologically ill asylum seekers can make a request for psychotherapy in the social offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, most experts or doctors who are not trained for psychiatric diseases would decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to error assessments, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
The Circus Probst rejects the traditions of the circus art with the new inclusion "Leidschaft".
The goal is to draw every age group in the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressers and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites in the manege on the brick to wash for dreaming.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine without living my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and Juniorchef.
"Leitness" - under this motto is the current manipulation.
For more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the family Test.
So the gift for enthusiasm is in the blood of the family.
"We are important to get people away from their everyday struggle and take them into a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old Junior chief emphasizes.
"Manegencocktail with World City-Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus programme is convinced by talented artists from all over the world.
Beautiful at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family draws the audience with joke and charm in its ban.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their crafts.
With the heroes of the stupid films, it wants to take the Cuban Duo looser.
Easyness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the Mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Besides many salmons, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with fingertips and jointness.
Balancing with the in-rad on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snakes are fascinating and scared at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as few others and fascinates with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," stresses Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Misconditions in the holding of circus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also comments on this: "If our animals are not good, we are not good either."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four leg artists", as they are called lovingly, will, if possible, be read from the eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel good, it doesn't want to be in the manege either.
The top commandment, then, is good for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPony Hungst and a Zebra Stute, the family is proud.
The two animals have lived together eight years in a walk and nothing has happened.
"Then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not ready for the manege yet, but for that it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So for each visitor, something should be involved.
"One thing is safe," says Stephanie Probst: "Everything whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always give our best and are wholeheartedly involved."
The Circus Probst invites its ideas every day from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 o'clock.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is family day, for the idea at 17 o'clock, prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal view is open every day from 10 to 18 o'clock.
Simbabwes Robert Mugabe speaks wrong in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down from a podium early in the year.
He remained injured, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also tempted by alleged Members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and had been warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's speech with Buhrufen.
Last month they had buried him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the movement for democratic change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that they warned to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said journalists according to Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament, and as soon as she leaves Parliament, its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers of the politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the framework of restructuring and savings measures in the company's services.
HP will later divide itself into two stock-noted companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its faster growing company hardware and its services business.
The expected loss of jobs leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive to lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support businesses in the transition to a new business style," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better established than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual turnover and "will be focused on the provision of inadequate, integrated technology solutions for companies," said the company's statement.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical installations and whose Palo Alto Garage was called "the birthplace of the Silicon Valley".
HP has run through a massive restructuring to manage the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The action of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US-tech companies, is the latest in this area based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger pointed out to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is planned, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England, and in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship will be uncertain in the next summer.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season strongly after a separate knee injuries and then returned to his old swing during the presaison.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not associated with his bowls or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognised, there is the associated danger of further injuries, always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd indicates 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 Liga games in the last five times.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight playing times since 2007/08 they were one of the two premier League clubs that have most injuries.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injuries rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from a hurt, you have an appalling period, a time when you have to strengthen your body and win battle power," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and he will run through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players who need to take a little pause," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is clear favorites to continue through Group F, the Maksimir Stadion in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unwritten after 41 games after the "inconsiderable" campaign was launched during the last season.
The stadium was shaken by a earthquake on Tuesday evening, with a measure of 3.2 on the Judge scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the teaching from the last season with the Champions-League capital against Monaco and remains driven by the remote hope of leading the association to its first Europepokal triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar presentations in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open themselves has become more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15-year high.
In 2013 it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In order to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably announced 2015 (CALM - campaign against a sad life) as the man's year, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the fight to overcome this challenge.
A current study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "sufficient mood", his chances of recovery were doubled.
For those who are not depressive, a circle of spiritually healthy friends half the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, one must have friends first to work a friendship.
In the age of social media communication, with its focus on style of substance, the inconsistency of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, violent and successful, even if in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call excruitive values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects our spiritual health much more profoundly.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can't really buy luck.
The beautiful thing at Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which glanced as a friend by interaction.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequently embraces, moments of football watching in cozy seats and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to any case, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of telephone care explained to me... "My listener role for people who feel depressive and are suicide threatened has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old use of words "I get to it" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you openly talk about problems."
Friends is one of the shows I think when I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
As much as my objective external status via the phone can help people at the moment of despair also, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, when you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the scenes that are completely reconstructed to celebrate the day, why not take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Debuts as a PSG player who brought the French master on the way, but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their precursor when Cavani reached a headballtor in the 61th minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they intend to seek the qualifications for the K.O.-runs, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's class game wasn't forgotten chances before the gate. He was later exchanged in the game against his hometown team and against the association with which he began his illustrated career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or outward in the Champions League. Therefore it is a good start to win 2:0 to cause our opponents problems and relax to look back, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect over the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't achieved one or two more gates."
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned in one of three changes to the Paris team, which on the weekend could hold a 2:2 disagreement on its own place against Bordeaux in the First Liga, but he was excluded by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wingstorm was called the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month, and he indicated why when he was in Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he passed through Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the network.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, arrived at Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was set up with a five-man defense and two deeply in the middle.
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who went far to Kevin Trapp's Pfosten in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, the PSG gave up himself at times, with some misinterests and bad closures, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, at not less than five trials alone in the first half, was paused and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after restarting.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his companions into play, and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a turning shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52th minute at the post...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayer achieved his sixth season station after Ibrahimovic had caught a left flank from Maxwell.
This ended all the thoughts that Malmö could come back to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the end result low before the replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was explored a gate at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions-League game was last year in December.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The skills are not sufficient."
Hut off Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects 2.5 billion dollars by stock sales
The mining-Riese Glencore, which is located in Switzerland, affected by unfolding raw material prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday by a stock sale as part of its huge debt removal plan.
The company Glencore registered in London said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company that lost 57 percent of its market value this year fights with falling raw material prices, as China's economic downturn insists on demand and harms on markets.
The issue of reference rights led Glencores to a rapid increase in the top of the London Stock Exchange at trade early Wednesday morning.
The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ share sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to add about a third of his 30 billion $ debts.
The company sold the new shares of 125 Pence per share, meaning a 2.4 percentage discount at the final course on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
The concerns regarding long-term growth in China have reduced iron herb prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw material prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday after a most long escape, 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The most recent convenient is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit in the United States at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a declaration on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis first official in Washington, takes place on September 25 and responds to President Barack Obama's journey to Beijing last November, said the statement.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will be hosts of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan with a national dinner after the two leaders have conducted bilateral discussions.
"President Xi's visit will offer the opportunity to expand American-Chinese cooperation in a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, but at the same time, President Obama and President Xi will also offer the opportunity to deal constructively with areas of disagreement," adds the statement.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US-technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before traveling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of conflicting issues, including Washington's concerns about the supposed cyber spying China and its increasing self-consciousness in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.

A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy motorway then the evil wake up.
In a company in Gotha, you can fulfill the dream and once borrow and drive a V8 U.S. sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 PS.
So did a 29-year-old from Gotha.
On the A 71 at Arnstadt the dream was then out and over.
The 29-year-old lost control over the sports car, went on a wet road into the sludge and went to the guide plank.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage is estimated to be EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
World and Europe Champion Xavi has played for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Katar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was apparently short of the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish master, three times Pokalsieger, four times Champions-League master, two times Club World Champions, two times Europe Champions, once World Champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Katar.
Yet, in an interview with Marca Xavi now tells that he was before the EM 2008 before the appointment from Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing," he says.
And that also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rommenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change was not possible.
And the decisive man is working for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"How did he get me?"
Who knows how Bayern's playing time 2008/2009 would have run with Xavi.
Xavi standed for Barca in the quarterfinal of the Champions League against the Bavarians across the entire distance on the razen, the reds switched off (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated at the end of the royal class triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity down in film creation
Matt Damon confronted the Afro-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a series of Sunday Night of HBO's Project Greenlight, the experienced actress Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected screening book of the project.
"If we talk about diversity, then you do it in order to occupy the film and not in order to occupy the show," assured Damon.
Brown responded shocked, with offended unbelief and cried "hoo! wow. Okay," when the comments of the actor of The Martian stood.
Damon and Brown joined the producers' colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show financialists.
"I would like to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the harmony," said Brown first.
The only black person, and she is a nut that is hit by her white holder.
The producer of Dear White People used for the finalists Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio for the regiment rights on the film; Damon replied that their regime could "at the end give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was spread, the social media exploded before disapproval about Damon's comments.
Twitter-user Mr. Pooni expressed his wrath about the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks of the only black person in the room, so he can explain its diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts."
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since his publication.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racic representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved a countrywide effect and urged lawgivers and authorities to offer discrimination against coloured restraint.
In February, the singer Prince made an indication of the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox-News-Personality of Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be regarded as a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a loving group," the leaders said.
Recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls, which are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope, it is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional chat climber and support Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete that won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the big price of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just completed its 7th season, had never experienced a competitor who could complete all the stages of his obstacle parking.
During the season finish, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, were able to get to the final.
The last task was to climb on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time, with which he was the first athlete who completed the challenging phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge full of three seconds faster, making it a victory.
Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard fighted victory, still under shock about the profit of the Great Price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about that I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his hope of money.
As suddenly as I can't even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why British, although he ended the Parcours as the first, did not receive any price money.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one Finalist, it will be the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets the great gratification.
I don't think he's having any wrestling about it.
He was just as happy to have done what he did.
He received a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be hit by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighteen staffels, the turning work will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tiger's slice at Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not funny for detroit Tigers.
Earlier they were one of the best teams in the baseball, today the tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but this part played perfectly on Tuesday against Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field.
The Twins lost a chance of rising within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard Square.
For Detroit, although only for one evening, it was a return of the three letters of F word that was so difficult to take over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories make fun, no matter how it comes," said Tiger's manager Brad Utmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit pointed three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and enabled three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to finish this year strongly," said Simon.
It's hard to throw in the bullpen every game, and therefore I want to go very focused into the game.
The designated Tiger Heather Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit game of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He well swept the throat," said Utmus.
He looked good at the (slay training), looked clearly better in the bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.
With three runs at the end of the seventh innings, the twins had their best chance to get back to the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton completed the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the Strikeout before he was replaced by the left hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy, the only man with whom he was confronted, overcame Mauer before the designated Rookie-Schlagmann Miguel Sano, who escaped a two-run to the right hand Drew Verhagen.
With a couple of louders and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double game.
It was the 27th leadership in the Major League in this season that Plouffe hit a double game
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth Innings, the wall created a RBI double against the closer of the Tiger Bruce Rondon and reached the stand of 5-4.
However, the right hand cut Sano out at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a unmovable Phil Hughes in the event of the game.
The tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right hand veteran, which had been removed from the injured list before the game, after he had missed more than one month for a back suffering.
"Of course not the beginning I wished," Hughes said, "but I felt better than I left and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After they first received the Leadoff Batter, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" during the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the Scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, achieved a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from the Center-Failor Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"It was a big hit," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, did not reach points in the third inning before he was replaced by the reliever Judge A.J.Achter.
At Hughes, there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four stripeouts.
OPINIONS: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez expired because of a violation of the architects.
He was investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list because of a shoulder degradation, is supposed to be activated for the start of Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July
He has missed since August 20 because of a destruction in the right hip gel.
The tigers and the twins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees should be in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people involved in it should then be dwelled in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday night.
She expected refugees from 450 to 750.
Several sports halls of the Hessian capital had been prepared for this case in the past days.
Up to 1,000 refugees may be temporarily dwelling there.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the first-name government presidium of Gießen, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Münchner Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria an opportunity.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options should not take place without Germany," he said.
He rejected the European states "collective waylooking".
Four years ago it was delighted that the Kelch had passed a military participation in Germany.
"Now the conflict is cracking in front of our door," he said in the German radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase in international assistance at the site for refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner explained that no one was sent back to Hungary on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television broadcaster ORF.
Germany also sent no refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement where Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria a day, Mikl-Leitner said that there have already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and German Representatives in this regard.
She did not mention concrete numbers and referred to conversations on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU Heads of State and Government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started temporary border checks on Sunday.
The EU Member States have not yet been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
The EU Ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday (22 September) at a special meeting.
In view of the strong refugee force in Germany, the covenant wants to support the countries in the first intake and distribution of people.
The covenant would manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced it late Tuesday after almost four-hour discussions with the Ministers at the Canzleramt in Berlin.
Merkel underlined, those people who need protection are also favorable to them.
But whoever has no remaining perspective can not stay in Germany either.
This opinion had been decisively divided in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole had to deal with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now trapped on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia in the night on Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that the border of Romania should also be locked up with a cave.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia in the EU.
Hungary wishes to prevent Schlepper from seeking routes across Romania, said Hungary's foreign minister Peter Szijarto to the planned new border line.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut the crown.
According to thousands of other migrants on the way to the Greek border, it was because of eyewitness reports in Turkey.
Space zone "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the icespaner of the Saturnmond Enceladus, a global ocean swallows.
This closes researchers from observations of the space zone "Cassini".
Thus, the moon easily wanders on his path around the ring planet.
Although this double movement is only small but still too large for a continuously fixed heavenly body, it says in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State of New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the Icarus journal.
It was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice deck of Enceladus.
Thus, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of the Saturnmond in 2006, spraying water and ice particles and thus feeding the so-called E-Ring of Saturn.
At least on the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers closed then.
The expansion of the hidden ocean, however, was not clear.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich has to quit about a month at the open-label author Valdet Rama.
A study has caused an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association reported.
Rama had already complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced pause".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a hot loss."
"Of course, we have to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "picture" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of an unequivocal professional.
As a training guest, however, the 1960s initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Mrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his ability".
Torjger Rubin Ocotie can return to team training next week after his brain shattering.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the course training.
Okotie had injured himself in the party at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collapse.
But against the first fears, he remained without a serious blessing.
No diet fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and soft-sweet.
But whoever wants to take care of his narrow line, he is often rejected by them.
Because mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. But mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its predecessor beta-carrotin.
Thus, those who eat the fruits support vision, immune system and metabolism processes in the body.
When buying Mangos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell.
The shell color alone doesn't tell how mature the fruit is - so green mangos can also taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet foods.
However, a mango also gives a special note to hearty courts.
It facilitates the slightly bitter taste of some sheet salads such as chicoree and radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The US package service UPS will restore up to 95,000 aids for Christmas business in the United States.
The company already started recruiting seasonal workers, announced UPS on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are searched.
Already last year, the UPS had increased its employee for the holiday season by 95,000 aids.
In view of the emerging online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been taking arrangements for Christmas business since last year.
In 2013 late deliverys had brought harsh criticism to the package services.
First Fehnstorm, then marked cold front
In the next night, in the valleys of the Alpine North Side of the Fehn breaks through, as Meteoschwitz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the fountain blew partly with storm strength through the figs.
After fenners on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, which brings strong rainfall, windbows and a temperature decrease.
As MeteoNews writes in a communication, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive deep-pressure area across the British islands in a strong southwest stream.
On the Alpennordside the night breaks through the valleys on Wednesday.
As a result, the feather blows up to Thursday morning in the fountains with bows from 60 to 100 km/h, singled and especially in the Urnerland partly with more than 100 km/h.
The feather can move forward to the nearby Mediterranean, and on the mountains, even orcan beans are possible more than 120 km/h.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy fountain provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, moisture begins to steep on the Alpic southhang.
Here are rain that last until Thursday.
In sum, south of the Alps must be calculated in the next 48 hours with partly more than 100 litres of rain per square metre, which has fallen large amounts of rain in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the fountain goes out of the air, and then a cold front rolls over Switzerland with strong, partially throughset rain from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshs strongly to stormy, and the temperatures go significantly down.
The following days appear in the north in autumn of 15 to 20 degrees, but in the south it becomes sunny and warmer at up to 25 degrees in the weekend.
Rome now has a Martin-Luther platform
Nearly 500 years after the reformation there is now a Martin-Luther platform in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, on Wednesday an unnamed place in the park on the Oppio hill was baptized on the name of the German Reformator.
At the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now acknowledged as "German Theologian of Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name has been requested by the work community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, preacher of the Gospel-Lutherian community in Rome, reminded us on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes over centuries as a minority could often live their faith only in the hidden ones.
The place will be symbolically visible that their tradition of Christian faith was welcomed in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustine monk around the year 1510/11 in Rome for a few months.
He felt the city then as an escaped bable of sin.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him by historians in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had then launched the splitting of the evening church with his thesis against the discharge trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) thunder crown is one of the main works that Otmar Old has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning, was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motives formulated its very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and linen wall.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has received the 75-year-old - which is not equal to "lusty" pictures.
On the contrary, adapting to the respective topics can work quite dark.
About three years Otmar Old worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective artistic selection of the many topics of the "book of all books".
Its forms are cycles dedicated to topics such as crossroads, plagues, commandments or our fathers.
So he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing with its focus on art books.
And there is primarily the author of Klaus Altepost, who, on the basis of painting, has reconciled with the respective scriptures.
He has interpreted the scriptures selected by Otmar Alt and so into today, in current contexts "translated".
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between Martin Luther's original Biblical quote and each set of artists who here formulate his very personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry band has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old immediately allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimity.
Emotions were finally triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Huter Order.
"Then the education has already happened with the pipestock," Otmar Old recalls.
"I tried to work on this, perhaps to endure again with the Lord Father."
His second concern is to help art again in fast-living time: "The perception of image worlds is today characterized by reclame, and it is loud.
Symbolic is being pushed out there.
Artists have another desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I'm a dinosaur."
Otmar Old wants the viewers to be "invented" in the pictures, to be able to act on themselves, to discover and feel the strength they have: "The image is looking for its opposite".
Klaus Altepost standed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "always" to be a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he gets life with his images."
Old did not take care of fully understanding the Bible, but chose the important, also mysterious topics for him.
"This wasn't an eye-height cooperation," says Oldpost: "This is about the pictures that the text explains only".
For Hans Möhler from the Luther publisher, this work is an invitation to "depth his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's images speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love as well as those of responsibility.
A part of the originals - paper and linen images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX track is near
Plans made, place found, company commissioned, earth hills modeled for a round course: A year later almost everything was finished - yet before the official opening of the BMX-Bahn was already finished again.
Mistakes in politics and administration ensured confusion, especially in those inhabitants who did not tolerate the train.
So pushed hills, searched for new space - now with formal planning and application for construction permit.
The authorization will enter into October, the first municipal council of Sabine Mosebach-Bock was now able to communicate to the Children and Youth Committee.
"I hope this year is still visible," she said.
It should then be started with the work at the former hall bath without "extensive memory breaks".
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend.
The football responds to the emerging situation in Germany and the policy ensures its help in dealing with the upcoming problems.
"I think this is the greatest challenge of our country since the reunification."
"In principle, nobody can say that's nothing about me, I don't have anything to do with it."
"It must interest everyone to handle this topic," said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I'm next Wednesday at the office of the Chancellor and I'll meet the Prime Minister of State there, Mrs. Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"The subject will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football could and wanted to help.
However, the decisive soaks must be put into policy.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"About the Egidius Braun Foundation we have ensured that this programme is ongoing until 2019," explained Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some federalists also support this programme.
Already this weekend the 36 professionals set a clear sign when they will bear the impression "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left tricots instead of the normal sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusens Sportschef Rudi Völler of the "Image" newspaper ( Tuesday) and referred to the project as "naturality".
"The refugee drama is about everyone, no one must see away."
"We can use our radiation power, our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incrediblely," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hopfenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "high sign of the Liga".
For the EM Qualification Game against Hungary on Friday, the National Team of Women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a large community work of German football".
That all 36 license associations in their locations had started their own projects, would be great.
Similarly, the smallest and smallest associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have published, is lived in the football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This and the next year, together with the DFB elections and the Federal Government, the association provides 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The associations have also retrieved the total amount for 2015," reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP Director loses an eye at accidents
The head of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, reported several reports lost the left eye by a crash in early July.
In the case of the accident on the stairs of his brother's house in the United States, he had fallen on a water glass that he had worn in the left hand after midnight, reports the "Economy Week" on Wednesday.
"He was almost bleeding, was awful, then threw himself out on the street - that he told us this way last week," quoted the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott could do his work.
"Begin October, we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager is at the meeting and "full of work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the South German newspaper (Thursday issue) that he would come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP in my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the SZ.
McDermott usually penetrates between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP central in Walldorf.
He is important to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager of the SZ said: "Everyone can happen like that."
"It's important to stand up again when you fell down."
McLaren substitute pilot Magnussen without fighting ...
Magnussen twittered an appropriate photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was crashed by the wheel.
Thus, during the night race in Singapore on the weekend, he is as little as a spare driver for the two family pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as a week later at the big price of Japan.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all the hopes of a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europe League have definitely collapsed.
The national player will miss the table leader of the football League in Duell with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 p.m./Sky).
"We can't take back on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Federal League Top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach opened: "We expect to return from him to training on Friday".
In view of the high burden of his professional, Tuchel will not just change his tribe self on the reus position.
So he announced a change in the gatekeeper position.
So Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He trained at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the World Master.
However, Tuchel left open whether weeds will be used in all European League games in the future.
With high probability, he will also object to the second party.
The research statement of co-player Reus that the final entrance for the BVB in the Europe League must be the goal, the middle field player Julian Weigl considers that "Marco is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to take the title."
Roboterautos: Government wants a leading role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be, according to the will of the Federal Government, in the transformation of the car of technological leadership.
The Bundeskabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy document from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Automesse IAA of a "new mobility age".
The automated and networked drives will increase traffic safety and provide less stability, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband development and a rapid turnover to digital audio radio.
In order to test new technology, a test line is currently on the 9 motorway in Bavaria.
In order for the driver to be "reserved no additional liability risks", the Federal Government intends to "respect the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum allowed speed for automotive cars from 10 to 130 kilometres.
The Federal Government also intends to set up a change in the Vienna Convention, which has only been foreseen for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking over the leadership, the driver becomes increasingly a passenger.
The technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process the data in seconds fast.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economics, high automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, on public roads, driverless vehicles are "awaiting very far after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver resistance systems and high automated driving functions at the location of Germany, the authors of the study for 2025 estimate about EUR 8.4 billion.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD transport policyer Søren Bartol.
However, the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, the German self-curring cars are still skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey submitted on Wednesday on the AA on behalf of the Test Organization Dekra results that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be carried out in the next ten years, 32 percent only expects in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents count on autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the United States.
Without this, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely fully on a self-current vehicle.
After a survey of the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to deliver the control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, this could at least imagine 15 percent in the flowing traffic, in the dust 45 percent.
Well every four would leave the car control under no circumstances.
Boll declares team and double start at table tennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer wants to take the title fights from September 25 to October 4.
The final decision should be taken at the latest on 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The boys have learned it in the morning."
"We are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Rosskopf during the EM-learning in Düsseldorf.
Ball was at that time on the flight to a long-term sponsor date in China.
The 34-year-old German master is expected back on Friday.
"Unless Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favorite," explained single European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the setlist in Jekaterinburg, also reminded the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"These time Timo also missed, and we became European champion."
"Then we should orientate ourselves," explained the World Arrangement Fifth.
The English football national player Luke Shaw by Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg.
At the Champions League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defender was met with a tackling by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis showed the 20-year-old accompanyer of Bastian Schweinsteiger to a rail break.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures grey cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: show window pops that, thanks to video projections, look terrible human.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, which, among other things, became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and by putting men in rucks.
"I can't say today that I'm the enfant terrible of the Haute Couture because I have white hair."
"Even before it was bleeded, now it's real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Citizen Step on the Step), which is to be seen at the art hall of the hypo-cultural foundation from September 18, it is lucky that the fashionmaker has changed his initial refusal attitude to a view of his person.
In fact, he was opposed to it, because, "For me, a exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you get to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Art Hall, Roger Diederen.
It's about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly yet overviewable work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the scene is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork, for which much effort has been made: To freeze the pups, for example, a stylist has been engaged in.
14 tons of material have carrated the makers according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the October Festival, there was a special shame: a leather coat outfit with corsett.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("wives are smarter than men") and in people who are a little different," said Gaultier.
Gaultiers old Teddy is also shown in the exhibition.
He stands for the first secular fashional attempts of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he dressed his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
To play with a pop, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of fashion later he taught himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
But later I bought them, of course.
For his first own fashion show, he couldn't pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the dresses.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze as fashion nisch
Earlier, it went into the long sticking machines and to make timbers.
The polluted fabrics and tips were produced in a large amount for customers, for example, who processed them to covers and gardins.
This alone does not work anymore, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is again important.
In the early times of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a larger role, then was pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now discovered as a nisch.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: top in jewelry, in accessories such as bags and in regional traits.
Overall, the so-called vintage mode, which refers to past stylespokes, is an increasing potential for orders.
Whoever does not serve in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they are already half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the branch association Plauener Spitze and Stickereien, together with nine other companies.
Only they can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have been disrupted.
Private businesses and wholesale are almost no longer available.
Our products are hardly reaching the customers on this way.
Massware was made much cheaper in the Asian room today and almost exclusively distributed via chains.
In addition, exports weakened, currently to Russia and to the United States.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also attempts to point through environmental consciousness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have conducted a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible."
Reinhardt adds: "This also refers to the materials used".
Diplom designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Snowberger Outside of the West Saxony University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in sticks and tops.
In order to oppose the competition from the Asian area, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
There is a tension field between the freshest ideas of the designers and the businesses that have to think especially economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer's stamp.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter experienced the historic snowball tip.
The machine sticks on some places small hills.
The Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired of it: "I couldn't start with traditional splashes before."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an emerging procedure, it characterizes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the subject of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the United States, to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a memorial.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plants new "Mary Poppins" movie
You shouldn't touch legends, but Disney still dares to have a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to "Entertainment Weekly" it is not a new film, but a kind of continuation that plays with the magic child girl 20 years after the first film.
It's about the experiences of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the World Economic Crisis in England.
Anyone who plays poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director already stands firm: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy broader for the world
In order to promote growth, the economy needs to be widely open to the outside, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group responsible for the management of the reform.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Management Group for deepening a comprehensive reform.
To promote and promote reforms will create new vibration and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The management group has adopted a series of directives including a negative list of market access rules, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of state operations (SOE), inclusion of private capital and retention of the residential media system.
According to the statement, a negative list is drawn up, identifying sectors and companies which are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it has a greater role to play in the market in the allocation of resources, guarantees a legal business environment and makes the market opener, said the statement.
The government will also relieve controls of the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In the context of an offer to open publicly controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign-financed companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to use professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also held by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a declaration published after the meeting.
The EU wants to double the limit of mercury in robbery fish
The European Commission intends to double the limits for mercury in large robbery and thus to give consumers a much higher dose of nerve poisoning.
The Foodwatch Consumer Organisation, which is presenting an appropriate EU work document, criticized the plans sharply: "Risks and adverse reactions of lack of industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full alert to pregnant and small children," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt by Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or sword fish for "economic reasons" are to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
But large robbery fish are so heavy today that some 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the still applicable limits.
After double the limit values, only 14.5 per cent would be uncoverable.
In contrast, according to food watch, the EU intends to intensify the limits for other fish from 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, referred to this as "trick", because smaller fried fish, such as carpets, are mostly so lowly loaded that they comply with the planned maximum values already today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfide dispensation manoeuvre that helps the economy alone," explained Wolfschmidt.
Quecksilver is a high-toxic heavy metal for humans, which is strongly enriched over the food chain, especially in robbery fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "preparely low amounts can cause especially infants in the infants of the nervous system".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values, however, that a "health threat of the general population" is not expected.
Quecksilver comes mainly through coal burning into the environment.
According to a written statement from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal power plants expire more than six tonnes of mercury to the Greens-Bundesday Abgeordnetes Annalena Baerbock a year, two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanent and surface-thicked," the "piece" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish have already been among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
