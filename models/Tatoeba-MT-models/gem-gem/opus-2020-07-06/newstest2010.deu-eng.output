Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US President
The American president Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the peace nobel price here as the fourth US president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check of more than 1.4 million dollars for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The Head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Northern Metropole and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who chose him from 172 people and 33 organisations in October.
Afterwards, the president couple planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony at which Obama takes the Prestige Prize.
He receives this as the fourth president of the United States, but only as the third one who receives the price directly in the office.
The White House already announced that Obama will talk about Afghanistan war when taking over the price.
The President does not want to exclude this issue because he knows that he accepts the price as a President who currently leads war in two countries.
He has strengthened the war effort a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the cheque over ten million Swedish crowns (approximately 24 million Czech crowns).
The money he intends to spend for wealthy purposes, but he has not yet decided about a concrete karitative work.
The event programme then provides a bankett with the President and his wife, with which king and queen, except for Norway, will be present to the Prime Minister and other 250 guests.
Obama was very restraint from the beginning of the price.
He suggested, for example, that he felt that he didn't deserve the price completely.
He also repeated several times that it is not only the price for him, especially for everyone who seeks the same values as he.
Soon after the announcement, he pointed out that this is "inviting him to act".
Nature protection is accused of pressure
The Leitmeritz politics accused the President of the Citizens' Association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for pressure.
In several cases he lodged calls against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his calls, he called for money from the investors to his favor, said the leaderitz police speaker, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Protection Communityist Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and it threatens a prison sentence of up to three years.
The mixture containers in Brünn do not smell well
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packings, in the southernmost villages you can find again on a step and tritt the sorter dairy containers.
And in Brünn?
There you have to book a few minutes to find the suitable waste tones.
I don't want to say that the waste separation in Brünn wouldn't work at all.
But it seems to me whether the Council's gentlemen are inadequately concerned about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste range in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all by the number of waste tonnes for such waste.
Have they ever tried in the centre to remove the PET bottles in a collection basket?
It's just art, it takes time and strong nerves before everyone.
The only place I have ever found is the mortgage toward the Gans.
Mr Unterka should not be angry with his colleagues, but that is too little to me.
Besides that the waste separation is not a honey slick in other parts.
Therefore, whole series of my friends don't prefer to sort the waste at all.
From foolishness.
It's too far to the garbage tones.
I don't wonder.
I offered even after the celebration to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles.
But on the Konicova Street, I haven't seen any color molluscs in view.
Fortunately, I came to the right place in the road.
But the garbage was almost over.
It's still the centre of Brünn, which represents the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and any kind of aesthetics are likely to make the bronne socialists cold.
You prefer to buy the city a icockeyliga that makes us shame in the whole Republic instead of buying a few garbage tones more and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner fire.
I'm glad that I could confirm my assumption with official statistics after I've been looking for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the Society EKO-COM, Brünn is really the worst in the whole district of South Marina.
The "Paroubek" summit has retired the money for pensions and sickness money
After the left party, despite the government's view, gave more money to farmers and officials, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sickness and construction savings.
But neither for the national debt interest or for international court disputes.
This causes them even more problems that will be on the government in the second half of the next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the socialists and communists carried out the increase in salary for some groups, they expected that the government pays the money for the sensitive expenditure, age pensions or for the hospital money. "This is just a shaping of the problems in the future, mining," says Janota.
The loans are usually paying increasingly higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at any time.
Too much to choose where, the State Box is empty.
If social benefits or costs are not reduced for the state operation, the tax should be increased.
For all those who the left party now gave more money: the firearm, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
For the pensions or the sickness money of which account has disappeared from 1.8 billion, people don't have to be afraid of getting this money.
But for the price that the State is even more guilty - the next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state fund, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Janota Minister, debt will increase so fast and together with it will increase costs and interest.
The State will need the money for compensation, then it will no longer be sufficient to increase the VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity money, as the government made in its counter-deficial package.
Due to the distortion of money for some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the development of the railways and railways.
It is mainly the sections gained in competition that can no longer be projected and possibly reimbursed.
Most of all, which is not free.
This means a delay or a breakdown of thirty large buildings, threatened also the European Monetary Benefit, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed to solve the flow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ shareholders in which the State is owner of the Majority and then the money will be poured out into the transport funds.
The problem is that the level of the dividend is never safe and it is not at all an infinite source.
Last year, from CEZ, 18 billion flooded into the budget.
Each year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidation, the pension account and this money also serve as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to Nieveau from 5.7 per cent GDP according to the EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of transformations yet.
Nearly three billion fell the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for the disputes of the court, even for building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money, it is not safe.
This is a pure gambling game.
If we lose an international dispute, we have to pay it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The Minister will then have to save the money back or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
A hundred million are also missing for the two-miljard "state cash" project that has already started to monitor on-line for what the individual authorities spend the money for.
The first stage starts in January.
If the Minister of Finance does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions will come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will dominate two operating systems
The Americans expect the future with a phone that the user can switch on by pressing a single key between different operating systems.
The plans presented are promising.
It's enough to just press one key, and from Windows Mobile will be Android in few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to imagine, focusing mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We enable you to perform two user profiles at the same time on the phone.
You can switch between these, they can separate them into two home and working profiles.
Both will work parallelly, explained Srinivas Krishnamurti by the company VMware at the interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented last November and presented for the first time a few days ago.
The market will come in 2012.
The virtualization of the smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully conducted the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM storage of 128 MB, on which the listed systems were simultaneously running Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is in full.
The company VMware is now working together with European and American operators at the smartphone virtualization and to the customer the devices are to come within 2012.
Snow shortage on the mountains crawl the hotel owners
Scneeless pistes don't worry only about the giant mountain residents.
The missing snow also scares people from ordering ski stays in hotels and bedrooms.
Therefore, you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter holidays incl. Christmas and Silvester.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether we believe that this year's Christmas celebration will be on snow or "at Matsch", the operator of the Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, launched the information portal.
Whoever wants the Silvester stay in the spider mill exactly according to his ideas, should no longer hesitate with the order.
Who prefers to save and where the quality of the stay comes only second place, he can try to wait a few days.
The spider mill owners now offer mostly weekly stays for the Silvester Day.
I think they will try to sell them for a while, but then they also have to give up, and enter in shorter times.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, Jandura appreciated.
Free beds at all winter holidays always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas Week that is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
That is why we have prepared some more affordable Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, announced.
The Silvesterday in Giant Mountains can also offer the Vrchlabi Travel Office, but there are less free places here.
Good sale also finds the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are averagely sold.
This year, interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in giant mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the pistes are cut within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Reversely and a little better than last year, you can occupy the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On the Silvest Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied up to 80 percent for the Silvester stay at the central parking in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, half of the beds remain free.
pleasantly surprised us this year of January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A little weaker is in the midst of February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains is certainly increasing, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, suggested.
In the meantime, the giant hotel owners are waiting for a larger snow ceramic.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to rainfall, it should be on the mountains of snow.
But afterwards, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It is almost funny with what pupil striving Barack Obama, the president with his reputation of the most clever, repeated the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan question, which he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally swept out his desperately anticipated Afghanistan doctrine, it proved that he described it three years ago about the copying paper from the Busch-Irak scenario.
Not only that in the text he uses the speaking "like in Iraq" several times, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forward path" without tormenting.
He has, even three years ago, sent out the Bush Idea - fresh troop quotas in Iraq occupied by the Citizen War - as "unresponsible and in its consequences karastrophy decision".
However, the following months showed that the Bush strategy, based on Military Recommendations, was the only possible and very successful one that is no longer speaking in the news about Iraq today.
Bush's reputation was not improved, because objectively he left his follower a much more grateful starting situation than it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle is repeated.
In order to increase the troop quota, he again asked the military, especially the superior of the Afghanistan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even criticized the destructive protectors in the White House in spite of the subordination habits.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for better.
The President hesitated three months, but has not come to a better idea, so he has betrayed the general of 10 000 soldiers.
From Europe he pressed the promise for another 5,000, even if he initially earned at least 10,000.
Highest problematic in the entire Obama Strategy is his project to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-increase will bring the same effect as the Iraq action.
Despite the Brother War of the last years, Iraq society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the contradiction - no one can rely on and no agreements will be held.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces that are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only shine buildings that will continue to increase the patriarchal tribe relations.
The balance of interest between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the inconsistency of the situations that further complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences.
The construction of a "treatful state", which is the minimalistic objective of the entire operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizont of the Obama Strategy exhibited by its voluntaryism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and now it is on the edge of the explosion.
It believes that the small soldiers who broke out in the war cry about the "Frühheim return" can create a miracle here, only one really romantic soul that cannot be impressed by facts.
From the political point of view, the date for the resignation of the troops is purely unanimous because the Taliban will take this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans' willingness to participate in the fights in Afghanistan is disgusting.
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindush Mountains Foreign.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions do not affect Iranians, the United States has a very difficult question whether the problem is not to be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period in which America runs to Obama for a winner withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will also mean a dramatic turning of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation patch for Barack Obama is the fact that still remaining three years until presidential elections, and thus remains enough time to take action to another strategy, it would prove to be a total loss.
The managers of the Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive premium bonuses in bar
The leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonusi this year.
This announced the company who responds to the sharp criticism of their wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, but one can only sell in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the case if they are excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Reuters Agency, is at the top of the efforts to connect the Wall Street premium bonusi with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made himself the target disc of criticism, after putting up nearly $17 billion for the first three quarters of this year for premium bonusi.
The total amount of premium bonuses during this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measures shown today, according to the Reuters Agency.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political topic at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
On Wednesday, the UK reported that it intends to charge the Boni of the bankers who exceed 25,000 pounds once with a tax of 50 percent.
Similar steps also prepare France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all specialized areas, except in physics.
Five recorded women have now taken over the Nobel Prizes in the category and for literature in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf has taken over this year's Nobel Prizes.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostak for research in the chromosones area.
The price for chemistry has been received by the Israelite Ada Jonath with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for information about the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin forgave the Nobel Prize for Economy, which the Americans received Elinor Ostrom and her Landsman Oliver Williamson for analysis of the economic report.
The only professional category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao have taken this price for research in the glass fiber area and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the foundation of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomical remote tubes.
Each of these prizemakers has received the diploma, Nobelmedaile and certificate on the acquisition of the money price.
It is 10 million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize carriers in each category, the money price is divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated peace nobel price in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he recognised the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his way, and is also at the top of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
However, in respect of his policy, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the fight against world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers the withdrawal. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives early on Friday the financial minister, Eduard Janota, who thinks of his remaining in the government, because he has not agreed with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form of this released by the MEP on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the etat deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
The President's speaker, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
On Monday, Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
In Parliament, however, on Wednesday, the proposal for a left party to remunerate money has been voted and the money has been increased for the officials, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers.
The government has abstained from the social democracy's proposals that it covers increases the budget deficit.
On the one hand, between the Left Party and the Government, Klaus and the Legal Party, on the other hand, there has been a sharp internal policy dispute, because the questionnaire about the further work of the Fisher Office, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, is practically liquidating the package of savings measures implemented by the Fisheries Government in the autumn, which, according to its understanding, is to end the state debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget but does not have to, today in the debate with the entrepreneurs, explained that politicians have neglected the "sufficient problem", which represents the "indefinite deficit" of public finances for a long time.
He believes that there is no good solution anymore today.
Improvement could only bring a strong government, which could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS Chairman, Mirek Topolanek, suggested that the budget is cruel and the government should consider its further existence.
The ODS chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, is apparently not working anymore.
Premier Fischer referred in the editor to similar words as "strong expressions".
The CSSD Chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the etat deficiency is grievous that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unslayed" in the world shows a lot of the country, whose fight and victory despite some criticisms that the main role was occupied by an American actress.
The story tells about sports, races and Nelson Mandela.
The immature fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life history of the American Oscar shauman, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the one-and-nine-year-old Mandela if he could represent him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role Matt Damon takes.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The two-seventy-year-old actress, who had received the price for his role in Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", already represented the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, which has finally become a slavekeeper, a fictional American president, as well as God in "Evan Allmächtig", but rarely someone who is still living and is as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African Stateman was in prison for his active activity in the end of the apartheid in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free in 1990, and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unwritten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem of the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The request was to speak as he was
The film paints a true event where Nelson Mandela joined his forces with the captain of the South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienaar, to agree the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remains racial and economically divided even after apartment.
He believes that he can agree his people through sports, so he decides to agree the Rugby players that belong to the outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema wall.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to attract it as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak as he was.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, eat with him tonight and be behind his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, she is transferred, and I felt I know what you feel, he said.
It's important for me to be a different person.
Matt Damon represents in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national Rugbyteam, in which the white players have considered.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard Rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I sounded at the doorbell, that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'I look much bigger in the film'.
Despite the apparent differences in the statue of the actors compared with their actual models, he has received positive reviews under the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unwrought" and is also spoken of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his evaluation in the following words: "This was a very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret over Norway: The Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged only yesterday that a intercontinental ballistic rocket was tested beyond the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful again and the rocket called "Bulava", which originally should be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of Russian generality as well as the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the sample flights.
Bulava has mostly not been started or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, you already write about "Bulava" as about a "rakete that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This already 13th attempt, left normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight were technical damage on the rocket again.
The engine probably exploded at the third rocket level.
This time, "Bulava" started from the atomic U-boat Dmitrij Donskij, which traveled under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket enables the discharge from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an unspecified flying object over the northway was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian rocket.
This time, generality has preserved itself and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the missiles did not fall out and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged at the first stage.
Although no test start was made without error, the management of the Defence Ministry considers only six out of thirteen incomplete.
Thus, the almost fifty percent success fulfils the generality with optimism, and so it continues to claim that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even wear up to ten hyperscale atomic heads with a total weight of max 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow with 51 years
The legendary advocate Vjaceslav Fetisov presents itself again in a professional yashockey game with 51 years.
The former world champion, Olympic and Stanley Cup -owner helps his team CSKA Moscow in the need, and is probably already in the Fridaysduel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career with forty years, in 1998, is at the time president of the CSKA.
After Denis Köljas hurt, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the Agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscows of Sergej Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous Eishockey player will only affect one game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of these who can raise the moral of other players, nemcinov leader.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he will be after AP the oldest Russian professional ishockey game.
In the NHL, the legendary storm Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford with one-five years and was able to benefit from 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful icockey players in history.
In Dress of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic Gold Medals, seven World Championship titles and also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gathered successes in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup in the Detroit Dress.
He has been a member of the Eishockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai gave up to the trade unions. All overtimes are cancelled
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the trade unions on the suspension of all overtimes.
Due to frequently arranged overtime, the trade union announced strike willingness on Monday.
This was confirmed by the speaker of the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
The management, however, wants to agree with the trade unions over a Saturday team this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtimes were proposed for the reason that two working classes would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work on Saturday.
It also receives the employees in the afternoon for the Saturday layer of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they are allowed to pay for the surplus or they can take replacement leave for it on December 28 and thus extend Christmas celebrations, Vanek raised.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday layer are paid for the travel and lunch.
Having regard to the fact that the overtimes were the most urgent and burning point in terms of trade unions' demands and complaints that had suspended production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the withdrawal of all over hours for the month of December, Vaněk initiated.
The car factory's employees had been forced until last week to work almost every day after the eight hours.
From the date of signature, the trade unions will withdraw the willingness of striking.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions should be held on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on the fulfilment of the claims and sign a joint document, they are willing to withdraw the stress willingness.
The situation in the automotive factory has begun last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously struck because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the bad payment conditions and claimed sharks.
The management, however, held that the employees had to make the overtime to meet the automotive delivery needs.
The trade unions also demanded that the employees who had interrupted production on Wednesday, should not be punished with sanctions in their monthly term term.
In the field of overtime, trade unions call on to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they require this year to pay the fee of 5000 crowns.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai is now working 2000 people.
The series production was launched in the company last November.
Until this September, about 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in 'stolled' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works in the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact is overwhelming to the disadvantage that the connection to usual virus variants does not work as strong as one of the existing medicines.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured yet.
Patients can, however, extend their life and prevent the increase in HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus increases also result in development such as resistance viruses which are no longer effective medicines.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, VSCHT (Chemisch-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalokarboranes act on the protein substance responsible for increasing the HIV virus.
Metalokarboranes are compounds of bore, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus increase in other ways than all medicines used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists reach new 'extended' compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metalokarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiple cages consisting of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are linked by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Heavy and persistent virus
HIV protein is protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus scaling caused by the HIV protease, no mature virus particles would be produced.
When we turn off the HIV protein, we also disable the increase of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists in the press report issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemie of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which will then continue to change systematically.
Something weaker but more reliable
The effects of this series of substances against HIV proteinase are tested in the reagensive glass, including their persistent (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalokarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used medicines, but does not lose its effect on the resistent variants against which the medicines used are often unsuccessful.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its further characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, makes the metalocarboranes to interesting links for further development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institutes for Organic Chemistry and Biochemy and the Institute for Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fighting for budget. ODS started on fishermen, who fights themselves
The Chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, referred to the approved budget for the next year as "greyful" and the government of Jan Fischer's Prime Ministers should consider it to overcome its further existence.
The statement of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "great statements".
It is supposed to be time for the analysis.
The Vice-President of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the official cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, does not seem to work anymore.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the increasing deficit, or whether it is his stay in the office with the support of Parliament's links.
The approach to the problems of public deficits by the ODS and the social Democrats is diametrally deviating, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for 2010, by means of Link Party Amendments proposed more than 12 billion kroners.
Parliament has increased the money for officials, for the maintenance of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has rejected the social democracy's proposals that it covers the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage with a backing of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has fulfilled the government's wish, because also the modified budget is only a less bad variant of the budget project. Frase not clear
Disappointment and senselessness
The Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a senseless feeling, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government still assesses the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had threatened seriously with his withdrawal in the case that the amendments would be adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech television, Janota registered to the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
In this respect, he has indicated that he considers his further remaining in the office.
That is why his disappointment about the budget's handling.
According to Necas, fishermen are in favour of further fighting with the budget deficit, there is nothing to do with the government's nominators of social democracy (CSSD), which had implemented the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also clearly say that if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-steigering laws, such as those relating to sickness and pensions or the service laws.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS did not mislead
This is the matter of the Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek pointed out in a US text message.
It has mentioned that in some ministeries, people are in a seat position who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas emphasized that if fishermen decide to refrain from the fight against the deficit level of public finance, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left-hand magnitude currently in Parliament".
Then he claims that he cannot expect the support and tolerance of the citizens' Democrats.
I have not thought about this, and if this will be up to date, I will deal with it, the Defence Minister Martin Bartak nominated by the citizens of the Democrats said to the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer fled afternoon to the European Council to Brussels.
The ODS returned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Mr Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the modified budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister would expressly ask Members of the Citizens to allow them to adopt the budget.
We do not appear as fathers, we are not little children, so he then responded to the question whether the ODS was not reversed in the political debate on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I haven't noticed that my voice would be missing.
Even when I quit the mandate, I knew that in the next few months, it would be most important to bolshewizing Parliament and destruction, Topolanek responded itself.
Following the new drive plan of the CD (Czech railway), less trains will be driven for about the same price.
The Czech Railway terminates or limits some less exhausted quick and local trains from 13 December, while other connections are strengthened.
The entire range of transport will be reduced by two percent from the day of validity of the new driving plan compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. basic and customer driving tariffs are not amended.
For example, several connections in the capital get the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the type of Pendolino for this route.
The quick train will no longer drive to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Minor quick trains will also be driven on the path of Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction plans the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, on the other hand, can look forward to an increase in Prague and the surroundings.
Two night trains are also lifted on the route of Prague - Tabor - Budweis, and in a few days a week, the operation of some quick trains on the route of Prague - Pisek - Budweis is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to climb.
It is the fifteenth roadway of the Esko pre-road transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The distances to the capital will end at the Prague - main railway station.
The CD introduces more connection lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Summer/Jesenik will be driven in two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have been unable to drive to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year's account for regional railway: increase by 200 million
The fast trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, the railways are totally paid to compensate the so-called liquidity loss in the next year four billion crowns, just as this year. The local trains provide the districts, totally pay for eight billion crowns in the next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns expensive.
For the local trains and the quick trains, the railway has re-finished a ten-year contract until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps it has not taken the price increase at the large majority of the licences.
Changes only occur in single-day network licenses CD Net and in favourable internet licenses eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven stick, until now it was uniform for travel between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine Millitante arrests more than 50 people who have been released.
Millitante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some basic schoolers and their teachers.
This has been mentioned by the AFP Agency, which initially informed only over 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children held were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
==References====External links==
Approximately 19 millitantes claimed to use the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
The local negotiators now strive to issue the rest of the hostage.
According to the AFP Agency, the millitants belong to the New Population Army (NPA), this is the arms fraction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence that demanded revenge between the two local family clients.
In the south of the Philippines, in the Province of Maguindanao, the recent massacre, where 57 people were killed, was detained of standing law.
Among the victims of the Massaker of November 23, which was associated with the election to the Governor's office, 30 journalists were.
Because of suspected participation in the massacre, the governor of this south-phillippin province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influenceful Ampatuan-Clan was arrested.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separators are also active.
However, those who have restarted the peace negotiations with the Phillippine Government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwood comes to the American cinema "Invictus: the Unslayer", which includes part of the life history of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against the Apartness has received Morgan Freeman, who had already been said to have been elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
Matt Damon received the role of the legendary South African Champions in Rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the start of the film, the reactions of critics and the public are also sound.
Nelson Mandela
His name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, then in 1993 with the Klerk the peace nobel price.
He was elected to the President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are put into the film because it comes to the cinema in a time when it culminates the preparations for the world championship, on the one hand, but at the same time the media shake the world public with anxious news about the increasing racial hass and the discrimination of the inhabitants from the black dominant majority.
According to the News Agency AP, responses to the new film in South Africa are first and foremost positive, despite numerous reservations against the occupying of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is still proud of his own words on the new film.
From this role I have cleared many years and I have prepared myself well for it.
More times I met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I - as you say - can receive his energy, he started in the interview after the film's festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can get to Mandelas and his message with this movie.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every human being, he supplemented.
In the Dress of the Rugby National Team
The film is based on the bookframe of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated ́In the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that the people have united, portray the South African defender of human rights within his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman is endeavoring to assemble two races and for a year and day, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also appears in his role in the South African National Rugby Dress on the World Cup field, which then won South Africa.
For the entry of the race in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested fourteen years ago large ovations, mainly from the white audience, and thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may be doing it again to join the people into a single people, the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only black in the national team in 1995.
Whether the stressed situation in South Africa improves, that will only show itself.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, such as in recent interviews for the Rugby-Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to the UK.
The mastership starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the Ceps transformer in the switch system at the Vyskov municipality in the Louny area.
In the fire, according to the speaker of the District Fire Force Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, attacked six units.
Originally, the firearm wanted to let the transformers burn out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is removed with a mixture of water - foam and special discharges.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer incorporation.
Nobody was injured, the Havarie wasn't threatening the security operation of the management system, according to the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated to be several 10 million crowns, more precisely, the damage will be counted only after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new transformer according to Mandatova.
For over 10 years, Ceps' company has not happened anything similar, mistakes of this kind are rare, supplemented.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the speaker of the CEZ Society for North Booms, Sona Holingerova, because the fire of the Trafostation did not affect the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as a single operator of the management system, electrical pipes of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It entertains, renovates and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers, with which electric energy is transferred into distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura insists on penalty against three CSSD leaders.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is now in charge of trembling against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the Southern Maritime District, Radko Martinek from Pardubice District and the Head of Olomouc District, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a 20-minute nonview in the radio journal.
The complaint relates to the company's efforts to operate regional transport in some areas.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railway.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the roses, we only presented the offer over the extent that it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech railways because we would know the prices of the Czech railways that were completed last week.
So nothing remains to us but to fight us.
Because of this resentment of the Society Student Agency, Jancura said to the radio journal.
At the same time, he claimed that he has evidence from all the territories that they have taken their steps in line with European law.
That is why we prepare a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of the criminal advertisement to continue the medial show of Jancura, which serves him as a free advertising for his society and for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call for further leaders.
I suppose that in this matter it will also be clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail traffic and uses false and false arguments, said Hasek.
Jancura reported last week that he invested several million crowns in the advertising that will point to the disadvantaged step of the district.
He said to the radio journal that he interrupted the campaign after Christmas, and he wanted to continue after a new year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign launched Jancura after the districts agreed with the Czech railway on the operation of the regional rail transport and did not procure tenders for the contract in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is lawless and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, Jancura said that he already threatened a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we don't give up that we can also lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jancura said to the radio journal today.
Vaccination against Pneumocokks free and voluntary
Immigration against Pneumokokken changes the habit from January.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But now, votes report that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Climbing the preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumocokks.
The pharmaceutical institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines to pay health insurance.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free of charge for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumokocks, which were born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not received an vaccination dose yet.
Anyone who has already started the vaccination last year or earlier must pay for further recovery vaccine itself.
The first vaccination dose must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
A quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against Pneumokokka.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the latest children.
Overall, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
However, they save in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the state has spent about 500,000 per year for all areas vaccines of children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumocococcs cause medieval inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections cause us to die in hospitals every year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years of age.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory vaccination of children against Pneumocokka was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be a future obligation.
From January, it is intended to be paid by insurance and voluntary.
That the mandatory vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, the Chief of the Civil Association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has been working for the Pneumocokkic vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the voluntary vaccination.
That's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are pleased that we have managed to do this at least.
I think this is the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumocokks.
At this moment we don't consider this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the company of practical child physicians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then you could think about the reduction in the number of repeated vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary," however, Cabrnochova says.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of the parents to allow their babies to vaccine against pneumoccals from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcs is also breaching in the fact that it is paid as the first area vaccination by health insurance and not by the State.
Insurances should spend the money for the prevention to save them for further treatment, reports Cabrnochova.
Doctors need to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, involves anxiety of practical child physicians relating to the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased by insurance and the doctors should then receive them on the same way as other vaccines issued by the State to them.
However, some Members feared that the insurance could "export the money from health insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance pays them.
According to the estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
That's not gonna be easy, Cabrnochova says.
U.S. artist's son involved in "museum steel"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of the attempt to use painting worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania's police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken into his vehicle with a trailer when inviting 90 paintings.
It says that Frank Frazetta Junior and another man had used a bagger to enter the museum into the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his presentation of designs like Conan of the Barbar and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press reported, the artist stayed at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family fought.
The Agency reported that Frazetta Junior claimed, according to a police educative statement, that he was instructed by his father, "that he should enter the museum with all means to bring all paintings into a camp".
The Agency announced that Frank Frazetta Senior contested to have granted any permission.
Labour defends ethical and tax increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of opposition, economy and trade unions.
The conservatives said that Alistair Darling had given an opportunity to "run" to show that he meant it seriously with the reduction of the deficit by pushing out the decisions until the election.
The treasurer also made a contribution to targeting workers with low and medium income.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social insurance and a 1-procent capping limit of public salary accounts for 2011.
Social security insurance
On the other hand, the trade unions have protested that low wage receivers are punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned about the "probability".
The increase in social insurance - to about 3 billion UK pounds per year - has angryled the private economy, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the attention should be paid to economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than £20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
WORKING OF THE FORAB ETATING REPORT
Increase of social insurance by another 0.5% from April 2011
This year the economic decline by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50 % tax on banking bonuses
1 percent increase in liability tax for small enterprises rejected
Tax discharges for electric vehicles and wind turbines
State pension increases by 2.5 %
According to estimates of the Tax Office, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be poorer by £90 per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be less than £190, while a person with £10,000 annual income will be 110 £ richer.
The Ministers said that their objective of the half-age deficit by 2013 meant "slow decisions", but they also said that 60% of the charges of additional taxes would be out of the 5% of the top earners.
Minister of Finance, Stephen Timms, contests that the sketched tax increases and expenditure stops would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
"They are big numbers. They will bring us the deficit half-life and this is also essential for the next four years," he informed the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party's predictions on future economic growth – which affects the extent of the new debt and the speed of the deficit reduction – were questioned after the treasurer had been forced to revise previous figures.
In his opinion, he said that the economy will probably shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% decline foretold in April - while the debt would be 3 billion pounds higher than expected before.
"Passed opportunity"
The conservatives who wanted to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against the "Schuldenkrise" of Labour said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years would be indispensable.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan to reimburse this and press "cynic" before difficult decisions until after elections - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"You didn't say anything important about what they're going to do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "You had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass."
"The significant announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour maintains that schools, hospitals and the police are preserved from future reductions, unlike in the proposals of the conservatives, which see the deficit capturing faster and more likely.
But the liberal Democrats said that the money gained by tax increases and expenditure stops is used to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
The political editor of the BBC, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment for some invalidity pensions in the next April - some would put the treasurer out of the presumption of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour urges to provide additional assistance when people need it the most needed and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Heal Etat"
Although the ministers have not announced any etat details beyond 2011, economists say that pressure on public expenditure will not be carried out in the medium term.
The recognised Institute for Tax Examination said that the figures of the treasurer would mean strong discounts in many areas, perhaps in future also in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defense.
"It only moves pain on later," said his leader Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic consultant to the economic auditor Deloitte.
"This was just the hole pre-etat report. The markets recognize that."
The FBI investigates "Festitures of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI examines the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested at an attack on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Pandschab Province, the American Embassy in Pakistan announced the BBC.
The FBI said it's being investigated if that's the same men who were reported to be missing in the United States of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they are also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be a Pakistanian descent, one is Egyptian origin and the other has a jemenitic background.
"If they are American nationals, of course, we are very interested in the accusations they are prosecuted and under which circumstances they are held," said Speaker Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schweit said that the authority was informed about the arrests and was in connection with the families of the missing students.
"We work with the Pakistanian authorities to find out their identity and the purpose of their stay there if it is actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistanian message in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had already been interested in the house and that no charges have yet been lodged against the arrested men.
The Reuters News Agency reported that it refused Minister Hillary Clinton to comment on the arrests, but she said that "the United States must work closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eliminate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported as missing by your families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "misery" in Iran
According to a report by the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, human rights are still as bad in Iran as in the past 20 years.
The report details the regime's "misuse pattern", both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report indicated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of his human rights balance.
Official authorities said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedshad, thousands of people were arrested and killed in Iran, resulting in the biggest road protests since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Thousands of prison sentences and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protest of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, some of the abuse claims recognized and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Station.
But since then, there has been no more tolerance from the authorities to criticism, our correspondent said.
"Falish confession"
Amnesty International quoted the 26-year-old informatics student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was accused of "working with Facebook networks" and of the protest against the election results.
"They often hit me in my face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half consciously, released on the street, Amnesty communicated.
The hit presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and rape others.
The Iranian authorities denied the proposing of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been held in a container in a prison in Kahrizak with 75 other than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the courts had established a committee to examine the distresses of the elections and the reactions of the government, but so Amnesty, the mandate and power of these institutions would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a sign into Bristol into a competition piste.
The skiers of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who struggled for money prices.
On the top of the hang in the Brandon Hill Park there was a short sprong at the beginning of a 100 meter long hang.
The student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said that there was a beautiful view from the peak of the hang, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great look with all the lights of the city that glitter below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prices were granted for the best pieces of art that were exported on the hang.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow will be left to smelting.

Can Islamic be French?
Pluralism and Pragmatism in a secular state.
During a time when Swiss voters voted for a ban on the construction of minarette and concerns about the so-called islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and integrated a well-developed report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's most so-called secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book of admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French do not love headwears" (2006), a elegant and pronounced study of a dispute that the country shared and busy over a decade and which is still to be seen today.
Bowen's newest book offers a more comprehensive and chilling spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants not only to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what really happens in the field.
He spent months in mosquitoes, schools and institutes, which now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, he gives debates between teachers and students about the questions they most worry about.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a city house (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it possible for a Muslim to use a zins-oriented banking system to get a hypocrisy?
They are these seemingly profane matters, he claims that they are the daily life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media are dealing with.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academics born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim and, on the other hand, a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
Conservatives are distrustful of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who asked the bows are mostly unanimous with their salafi spheres – enthusiasms of the purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – which today show a small but impressive presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions how far French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elites, so passionately guarding the separation of church and state) really feel obliged to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a harder treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to make their historical compromise with secular Republicanism.
He recognises a "intense of values screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you are inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The Trustlessest View of the World
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The ice that she identifies smiles with an alarming speed and takes life with her, which can never survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, vessel and fishing interests have come into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their chicken waters.
Richard Ellis, a author and illustrator, draws in "On thin ice" (Original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icons of the north, of the ice bear.
In the complex history and politics of the whale fishing, he describes the long tradition of the arcticist researchers who proved themselves to be hunting for the ice bears.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old fanry to the lake, which struggled only with the gun coal of his muskets, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught when they swim behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers, were brought into zoo and circus.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears in an idea.
Even today, zoo plants still typically possess a million set of life of a wild-life old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the ice bear in Singapore became quite green by the algae that grows in the hollow hairs of its peel.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters represent for the survival of the species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, the establishment in Greenland and Canada continues, where hunters in helicopters and motor-sliding inuit use powerful storm guns to bring their cups to the route.
Ironically, in the northern waters of these two hunting nations, the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice" (Original title "After the Ice") Alun Anderson, an exhibitor of the Science Magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and alarming description of the science of the Arctics and a thorough insight on how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographs can properly explain the speed of changes.
But that is not a lack of explanation attempts.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th century made the first confusion of the packeise notice.
Undersea boats in the Cold War are the thrive graves when they are undergoing.
A useful supplement is satellite measurements and large-scale distribution of measuring suns on icebergs, but a lot is still achieved by unresistant people who are fighting outside in the cold.
Anderson casts a look into the strange, tiny world of the refugee system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by saltwater racing sales, which are pressed together when freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic small miracles in the ice, all of them are threatened when the summer ice goes away, which is calculated in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... could it be us"
Marine infants were among the 6000 who settled in Arlington Kränze
The upper-free De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours with the bus to put one crown on the grave of a soldier that he had never met.
For him and the other marine infants, who took the journey from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Peace Station in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a treasure to men and women in whose footsteps they went.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back, we could be that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to put cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Friedhof.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves on the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and morrill and his wife Karen, who are doing this trip every year, in various cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which also extended the event to other countries.
This year, more than 16,000 volunteers put on the graves at the Arlington Friedhof, in areas of Pentagon, on graves of the Fayetteville National Friedhof in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and at the United-Airlines Airport 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation spent more than $150,000 for the purchase and transport of the crop.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she took the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a dead professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give back something that brought the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution to supporting civilians.
It's like the visit to a family funeral.
Packed in places of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the expanded grass surfaces and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from World War 1 and 2 and the Vietnam War as a goal, since they are not as often as the newer graves, the organizers say.
The mood was joyful, children played and pairs kept on the hand while they wore the fresh bowling branches to the greying grave stones.
Each round crown was dark green with a small red slide that was fixed on the upper part.
The section 60, which is nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have been buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations spent 1,000 crowns to decorate this section, but the darkness of the current wars fulfilled this area.
Some were crying openly, others prayed, and families and friends stayed together in the iron air.
Some read, according to the names melted in stone, while others buried down to small black-white slot cards that had been put in the moist mud whose grave stones were not yet finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who forgot bitter tears before her son's grave.
She traveled 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave site of Marine Infrantry Underofficer David Shane Spicer, who fell in the battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I haven't been here for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
Contractors of the US Government of Cuban authorities arrested
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor of the US government selling mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday.
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc. with a seat in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers, such as USAID, US authorities for international development and for the World Bank.
Consular officials of the US Interest Representative in Havana try to gain access to prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The special accusations have not yet been published, although, according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything under the charge of the "payment".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Government hostile Graffiti and statements are considered to be severe crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community, led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government representatives.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested an authorisation to leave the country to receive prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the Castro Brother in Cuba and the Obama government, which aimed at a "slow" approach to improve relations with the island.
The message of arrest was first reported on Friday by the New York Times.
The new US politics emphasise the fact that the United States will achieve a counterpart when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desired products in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 per month.
Only since this year the Cuban government has allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone, they are used for sending text messages, since a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a daily salary.
Internet use is extremely restricted on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and to some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Too many websites, access is limited.
On Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting for crimes like drug smuggling behind grids, said Gloria Berbena, the press speaker of the US Interest Representative in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide any further information on arrest.
The arrest and arrest are clearly wrong.
One activity legally in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, who recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba", said a reply to the office of Raul Castro as leader of the country, which replaced the sick elderly brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused were very often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within one day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries move towards each other for more dialogue.
Pakistanian government representatives cover the plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistanian authorities discovered a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hoped that this case could help to discover a broad network of terrorist candidates seeking the Internet for radicalized young men.
Ermittler said that they had searched for an opaque opposition, known as Saifullh, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had invented them because one of them had delivered comments on terrorist attacks on the Internet video page YouTube.
Saifullh was the leader of these men after her arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribe belt, which is the home of Al Kaida and his terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's Secret Service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah couldn't convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held in the eastern city of Sargodha over days, far from the incredible mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refugee place.
They were considered to be part of a hidden operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men weren't discouraged at all and continued to try to receive the right recommendations to obtain access to the Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani penalty authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being consulted by the FBI - underlines the crucial role of the candidates in identifying future terrorists and perhaps even more important, in the decision which is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US Secret Service has made it a matter of urgency to place human assets within Al Kaida.
The candidates of the organization act as a peasant who do not let those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spones.
American wishes recruits are subject to a special test by A Kaida, said analytics.
However, because of their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior Analyticist of the NEFA foundation in the United States, said that in recent years terrorist groups have become much more cautious in order to allow access, since the US Secret Services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to locate someone into these groups, what better way could you go than follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators in Copenhagen demand climate-"Action"
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets on Saturday and demanded more coincidence in climate protection by the dealers in the Bella Congress Centre of the city.
Demonstrants said that 100,000 people had joined the event, but the police estimates were more than about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists had small explosive bodies near some government buildings in the city of the city.
On one day when the climate negotiations supported by the UN did not happen, thousands of activists walked through the city with transparents on which in English "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which explained "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the travels to Peru, the country of her mother's birth, make her aware of the heart-breaking problems that the country faces as a result of the remarkable impact of climate change.
This is part of the motives why I decided to take part in the great demonstration - to continue the word and appeal to the world leaders, to establish a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not a easy task, but it has to be done now and there's no way that runs around it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from getting too close to the BeIIa centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or brought pocket knife.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be mentioned, since he was involved in climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing in a number of explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, where there are several ministeries.
They threw them close to the buildings, he said and added that they were starting as lamps, but then followed by "a few large explosions".
In the interior of the Congress Centre, people gathered before television screens to follow the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main functioners, such as Su Wie, China's Chief Climate Distributor.
When he was asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of."
He then went to Mandarin and said, "Because the place of events is large, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He found that it depends on the perspective of individuals whether the demonstration would damage or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they are disturbing the negotiations or the freedom of others".
Testing data show hard-nail breeding air
The certificates for mathematics were welcome good news last week for public schools in Washington D. C.
Although Washington’s district is still far behind the schools of the country, which produce the highest performance, the evidence shows that the four-and-eight dressers have made faster progress in the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest numbers of the National Evaluation of Educational Progress (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) is the hard-navigorous gap between Afro-American and White students, both at local and national level.
In the last two years, the average score of the white quarters from Washington D. C. increased from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but only by three points from 209 to 212.
In fact, the power gap increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the Afro-American Achtclisters was generally the same, he fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, as the sample volume was not large enough.
The image over a six-year period is also not encouraging.
The NAEP's first NAEP recorded in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score of the children of both groups has grown during this period, the difference with now 58 points has hardly decreased.
Some scholars of the district expressed their concern last week that the results of school Chancellor Michelle A. Rheee and the democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty were predominantly promoted by white pupils who are already powerful children.
This suggests that we have raised the overall evaluation by the treatment of those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that enters for educational equality in Washington D.C..
I don't jump up for a span of two or three points and fall down, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Basic School.
Brown, a common critic of the management style of Rhee, said that the message of the test points is that the city's central schools need urgent attention.
Of course, we always want to see the positive signs, I respect.
But what fears me is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy that we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the weak students.
In this autumn, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading plan, the Wilson Reading System, which aims at students in the upper classes of the basic school and the middle school, which have not mastered the basic skills of reading at the beginning of their school course and which are significantly behind their equal age classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a educational plan, which brings the forefront from the children's garden to the sixth class of games and lifeful experiences, was brought to Washington among the former leading school inspector Clifford Janey, and this doctrine is awarded some of the NAEP progresses reported last week.
I mean, we must continue to work to make the best measures to benefit the students below the note level, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP findings highlight the question whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and can continue to provide additional money and resources for the weaker schools which are necessary to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor for Education at the University of California in Berkeley, investigating urban test results.
The conventional cure is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could lead to political implications that work against this important agenda item.
The weakness is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that she is trying to keep the white and black middle layer.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the districts so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now school Inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for the closure of the power closure is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the Charter Schools.
One must increase the school year to nearly 200 days in order to have the power to change, Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he considered as a "a milestone" on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than for the future
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud pie.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the stone fibers and the smaragd green grass.
Gracielas parents have hardly completed the high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was stored in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never put a foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and the other eight-looker of the group who explore Gettysburg where the lesson costs $38.690 per year was rather the one of an awesome visitor than the ones of an enthusiastic future students.
"Yes! I'll be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now joined the building for sciences.
"Wow, really?" she thought when she was reported the low-professor-to-student ratio of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they recorded the intended message completely: the question is not whether you are going to the college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there are growing concerns about the large number of children of hispanic immigrants born in the United States who do not end the high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to rise in the middle layer.
In fact, one of the five of the "second generation" of Hispano Americans concludes the college – a remarkable performance, since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, says researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the labour forces of the country.
Those who investigate powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high goals and find ways to compensate their lack of confidentiality with American schools.
However, consulting programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children like them to come to college, especially when these efforts continue for a long time.
When you look at income weak children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in searching through the system, a single measure will not be solved at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davis, who investigated hispano American students.
We need to think about providing a supporting network for these children from the preschool to the high school.
The federal programme that Gracielas College Tour had financed is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - turn up a gang - and provides more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when income weak students are in the middle school and continue to run until they finish high school.
According to the US Department for Education, the programme has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has been able to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two sales concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in renovating the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the ten auctioned fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that gave a command has drawn the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields awarded in June.
The thin-seated representatives of American oil molluscs in opening the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Finally, after six years of war, Iraq has opened its gates and instead of US businesses, Asian and European, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offer in Iraq for a long time.
Security memories, which have still been stressed by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday and political instability through the deduction of the US Military have probably prevented American oil companies from engaging more in Iraq, which has the third largest raw oil reserves in the world.
In some cases, US companies were disadvantaged because competitors, in particular Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and have more risks because they do not have to account shareholders.
Exxon-Mobile and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Greater U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have close relations with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been assisted with technical advice in recent years, have gone out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts agreed to this weekend.
The state of China National Petroleum Corporation has offered more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, the speaker of the Oil Ministry, Assam Jihad, said that China is on the way to become one of the great world economy and a technology force.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure with its partners and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
For the fee of tenders elected companies, commands which were then compared with the fee per barrel oil, which the Ministry was ready to pay to increase the outlet of each field beyond the current level.
Top Planner of Al Kaida apparently killed in Pakistan
In an obvious US rocket attack along the Pakistanian border to Afghanistan, this week a top action planer of Al Kaida has been killed, reported representatives of the U.S. Terrorism fighting on Friday.
This would, if it would be confirmed, be the second fatal attack on a high responsibility of the terrorist organization in this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistan authorities, had been killed by a number of missiles who met their vehicle near Miran Shah in the province of North Walesistan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the rockets were fired from a drone type used by the CIA in the lawless tribe belt of Pakistan.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a representative of a Pakistanian civil secret service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Local residents who are suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the place and quickly took on all that was left of the "fullly destroyed bodies".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US Terrorism fight led uncertain evidence that Somali belonged to the dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Kaida, who led terrorist groups operations outside the Afghanistan-Pacistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies all over the world, observed a leader who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the vicious character of the U.S. air attacks on Pakistanian soil.
If one assumes his central role as given, this also included planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He accepted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and implemented them in operation plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. government representative said that Somali had risen quickly in the Al-Kaida Hierarchy and had best links with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second government representative, but this does not at all reduce the danger he posed for us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leader of Al Kaida or Taliban, who has been killed since September, than in a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribe area and three other top activists.
The rate of attacks by drones of the CIA has decreased from an average of six operations per month to two, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their viability and, at the same time, brutally kill in the suspected informers, the page reported.
Head of UN Messengers in Kabul will resign
The leading missionary of the UN in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his office in March, which would end a stormy term of office that was injured by claims on widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the UN.
Eides exits when the Obama government has decided to send another 30 000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN Messenger said that he was supporting the increase in the troops, but he also expressed his concerns that the U.S. timetable for the military withdrawal, which should begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of the Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilians to help with the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The army increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civil side, he said.
Eide said that he did not set down his office, but only fulfilled an agreement to his family in March 2008 to stay only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted the notification to UN--
Forward Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now to have time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the way of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban started looking for a replacement.
The UN representatives say that he considered the Swedish-Italy-speaking Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Bagdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously conducted UN Peace Operations.
Eides' position in Afghanistan was tested after his former vice-president, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September to prefer President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to exchange evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide has rejected all the accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - which was fired - "the mission has undoubtedly damaged because there was already a great degree of skepsis in relation to international interference in the elections".
Eide said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civil representative to coordinate the assistance of the U.S. armies in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to set up more staff from the United States and other Western countries spending for the Afghan mission and said that this would strengthen their confidence in the proper use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the comprehensive UN set-up schemes have undermined his ability to bring in powerful people.
The UN rules are so designed that since May, he said, only one person could set up.
This is catastrophic and should not continue like that.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Minister of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon be obliged to impose significant additional sanctions on Iran because he has not participated in discussions on his nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in the North Iraq during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and in Iraq and played the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there is no good choice, he said as a response to a soldier's question of the probability of such development.
"One of the things on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which is unpredictable to the war."
Obama government considers a penalty package aimed at Iran's military and political elites, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average survivors.
He said that a package of positive and negative incentives is necessary to convince the Iranian government that it is in fact less protected with nuclear weapons, because "your people will suffer unheartedly" under the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American government joined European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect "faithful" consequences if he does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its Atomic Monitoring Organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority, with its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should be obtained for peaceful purposes only.
At discussions in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said that he would reconsider the discussions to restrict his nuclear programme and to refrain from a major part of his stock of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for his medical research reactor.
The US government has pressed on this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But since that time, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements - partly, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is inconsistent about whether they should commit themselves to the United States.
That Iran simply left the international community with regard to some proposals that they had already agreed in early October, openly said, brought together the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, in a way that they were never in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
President Obama has set the 31rd Dec. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before persecuting other options, including those called "pressive sanctions" by the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once.
In a opinion issued in New York, Iranian representatives of the United Nations condemned what they called on Thursday "foundless and unfounded claims" of some Security Council members on Iranian nuclear activities and said they are willing to continue the discussions with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington on Friday, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before he fled to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish government representatives in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, especially in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays in the U.S. plans from reducing the American force by the end of August from 115.000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to break the Kurdish concern about the coming troop departure. U.S. representatives quoted Gates, who said to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change in course in the older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda patches that gave them talks that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons have taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course through the low birth rate and the elderly population this summer and encouraged young couples to have more than a child, their answer was immediately and final: "In no case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with a 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of one-child politics in China, which has produced two generations of notorically thick, outdated individual children, who are lovingly called "small Emperor", is a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate is 1.8 children per pair compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN-
The population department is established, while the number of populations aged 60 and older in 2020 should increase from 16.7 per cent of the population until 2050 to 31.1 per cent explosive. This is far higher than the global average of about 20 per cent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people have been almost 22 percent of Shanghai's reported residents, while the birth rate has been below one child per pair.
Xie Lingli, head of Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Mission, said that pairs in the mature age need to get babies to help "to reduce the ratio of the elderly population shares and to reduce the labour shortage of the future".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
The Constitution of the State in 1978 anchored China's Einkind politics is probably the most controversial available from the dominant Communist Party until today.
Couples who violate this policy have to expect enormous penalties - up to their three-fold annual salary in some regions - and discrimination at their workplace.
Chinese State representatives have attributed this policy to avoiding the critical demand for natural national resources, while human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of policies.
In rural areas, some officials who already had a child have forced to drive off.
Many couples had also been allowed to carry out sexual abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high relationship between men and women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude to one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions of the rule - including city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife have been single children - and in 2007 the tone of many harder slaughter was refined.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that government representatives have recently discussed even more radical changes, for example, allowing couples to be two children with a single child partner.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city in July, which started an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Places that taught families to have only a child were replaced almost overnight by directives which in detail describe who would be in question for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and transmit information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not just encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outer areas of Shanghai said that a breakdown in the applications of couples who want a second child after the campaign started, the urban districts do not report any change.
In the municipality of Huinan with an inhabitant of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are still available a month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city despite the campaign will still be about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to have children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that was also legally allowed.
But they have, like many Chinese, just a small health and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be inappropriate.
People in the West are fakely evaluating one-child policy as a human rights question, Yang said, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are robbing the possibility of having more than a child.
But the problem is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their delays.
Wang, the head of staff, said she wants only a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to care for everyone.
We are not used to take care of others and do not really want to do so."
Chen Seiian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unfamiliar.
For parents from the middle stage with double career, through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it turns to be successful, and for that, you need to be selfish.
The age group of today's 20-39-year-olds grew up to see their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they wouldn't want such a life for themselves, he said.
A single child, he said, also makes enormous demands for the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the room question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a life course for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are ready to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first one that has achieved a higher standard of life, he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
The UN Group sets up a plan for emissions reduction
The Climate Conference, supported by the UN, which has been awarded by wild poses and mutual accusations until now, has once again set a focus on Friday with the publication of a document, which has a ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrial nations having to train the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was considered to be an important progress in a negotiating that will take place in time, as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, which has been formulated by a specific UN working group for this purpose, is devoted to the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can master global warming short and long-term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large threshold countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increase that the political decision-makers would be involved.
The process will provide a great flexibility, says John Coequyt, leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has designed the six-sided document, has summarized a 180-sided negotiating text in order to focus on what the leading climate protection representative of the UN, Yvo de Boer, referred to as "the great whole".
It shows the basic risk of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations together would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 per cent by 2020 compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent in the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
In addition, the European Community has given the talks on Friday a boost by its assurance to provide 3.6 billion dollars per year over the next three years in order to support poorer countries in adapting to the impact of climate change - from the master of floods and droughts to avoid deforestation.
On Friday, however, the same verbated fireworks, which had determined the discussions last week.
The American climate-specific Todd Stern has rejected formulations which require binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger threshold countries, if they are not financed by the industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama government runs a harder line with China, as representatives of the Bush government not once two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the rise of larger threshold countries and take action, so star who also complained that the text would not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Star gave his opinion one hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Minister He Yafei, who said that the leading American climate dealer lacked either "the sense of reason", or it was "high unresponsibly" of him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not help China financially to master global warming.
By the future economic marching of the great world powers, both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the threshold countries have opened up breaklines.
The current struggle is equally related to the salvation of individual economies, as well as to the salvation of the planet, where China and the United States were due to their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozens of most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting about who should bear the costs of the braking of greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have been more aggressive to take the countries with very high greenhouse gas charges to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic dominance, such as Ulate, who is also active as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries who are most exposed to climate change have indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding contract in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the discussions will in the best case lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of the small island states with 43 members presented a 24-sided draft contract on early Friday morning.
Artur Runge Metzger, who leads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the openness of the small island states is "exercising political pressure on the whole political process," partly because they are now united and demand measures from the threshold countries, such as China and India.
The discussions got a new urgency when the delegates concentrated on the fact that most open questions need to be clarified before the government leaders arrived in order to reach an agreement.
High-level representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice Minister, escaped their planes and rushed through the gangs of the Bella-Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences in order to stop Claims negotiated during the next week.
The pure extent of the congregation -- 13,000 people go in and out every day at the Congress Centre, guitar-playing activists organise night shows, in which they make fun of the countries that believe that they are betraying and selling, and drafts of contracts are hand-to-hand rather than by email -- are already a challenge.
Intensity is just being built up: almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Policy of the Conservation International Organisation.
The heavy weights come.
United Kingdom's first 225 km/h fast train defines the Monday feeling new
Monday morning at 5 a.m., a pipe will push through the darkness to announce an assignment trip that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed donor train in the country will reach 225 km/h to London St. Pancras 225 km/h at its lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent.
Then, to Lord Adonis, the Minister for Transport, lady Kelly Holmes will be on board the first Javelin Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new service of Great Britain will finally connect to an international rail network of faster, reliable trains and connect the major ballast areas of Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living pendler cities, working hours would be radically reduced, and the switching of aircraft and cars to the train would reduce national carbon emissions and the steam on the roads.
In theory, the three big parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planned slaughter and fears of environmental damage could still draw the brake in the British high speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, according to the Times, Lord Adonis will submit the report on 30 December.
This will give him a detailed route map of the next planned level of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line to connect London to the West Midlands will pass with a five-metre gaming space in urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the free area, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final route.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, north-way high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped route leading a single high speed line to the West Midlands.
The route would divide itself in or near Birmingham and a branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another towards the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway inside.
After finishing, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 40 minutes to 2 hours.
The first subtle, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to return the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with today some more than one hour.
The designs offer trains the opportunity to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400 meters of trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation on the London-Birmingham route per hour.
This would in turn mean that in London a final station would be needed, where 20,000 travellers could be completed per hour.
Given the spatial restrictions in the capital, an existing railway station is expected to be developed to undermine the high speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston has this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan should be continued or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures will mean that a final decision will be made only after Parliament's elections.
But even if he moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains must first switch from the high speed trains to existing railways in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be more than three hours between London and Scotland.
This is considered as a decisive crackpoint to ensure a change from the plane to the train, a directional measure for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers come for hypothecism for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading sub-house member of the Conservatives, has charged thousands of pounds per year to the taxpayer for the costs of an orange which he reads in his home in his electoral circle.
The prison speaker of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron, complained that sub-house members must live "of magic rations", has increased its hypothecism by 75,000 pounds in order to build an oak wood plant on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to invoke the taxpayer the additional interest earnings, a total of hundreds of pounds per month.
The members of the subhouse approved the requests at that time, and they were not asked by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a review of the expenditure of the subhouse members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not be "no more clean or understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-house members, has a two-piece house in a village in his electoral district Ruthland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a subhouse expenditure control office, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he built a winter garden called "Orange" in the plans.
Neighbours describe him as a "glashout for entertainment".
Duncan was also not invited to take a position in order to increase the financial recording during a recent examination of his previous hypocritical contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The Committee freed him from the breach of the rules last month after the examination of its expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred security for a hypothecism of over 271.406 pounds (30,000 euros) from his London House to his electoral circus house, which he had bought in 1991, one year before his election as a member of Parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) a month as hypothecist interest backwards until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
Duncan's RBS hypothec interest has not changed during this period, which suggests that the total increase was used to finance the money incurred of EUR 75,000 pounds (8,000).
The normal stainless RBS hypothec interest decreased from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the subhouse show that Duncan continued to claim 1 250 pounds (1,400 euro) per month in this May.
Duncan lost his post in September as an opposition leader of the subhouse after a undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the issue scandal that members of Parliament would live "of magnificent races".
"In essence, if you work for the state, you have to live by magnificent races and you are treated like S*****e."
He said: "I have spent my money for my garden, and I am entitled to a descending little part, measured by what belongs.
And I could have demanded the whole fucking sum, but I don't do it."
The Member of Parliament, millionary from his former career as a oil-gross dealer, was attacked the first time in May because of his expenditure, as it became clear that he had invited thousands of pounds for his garden before clarifying with the Fees Office that this could be considered "as excessive demand".
As a protest in Duncan's Rasen, an activist has buried a hole in the form of a pound mark after announced that he had invited 4000 pounds over three years (4,500 euros).
Last night, when he was consulted about the increased hypothecism, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the Fees Office and the following of Legg to increase value."
He added: "There is no debate about deviations and divergences or a violation of the rules or similar.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It could not be cleaner and clearer at all."
Come all your believers to admire Brightons beach huts advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries by creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December with Christmas songs as a topic.
The event started on December 1, and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 p.m. at free glue wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dry fruits of bags.
The Christmas songs that have so far been selected are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an honorary clergyman of the Chichester Diocese and leader of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come to an odd old building? I think the church should go to the people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and vivid place and we try to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and in the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide on Saturday and in Copenhagen to require an ambitious and compulsory agreement on the fight against climate warming, where the police have taken several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, have been marched in the cold of the Danish capital, at the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion until Friday which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish Chairman of the Climate Conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, completely dressed in black, had cast windows with plastic stones and hammers, a journalist of the AFP found.
Anti-unrust police have attacked immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that, according to your opinion, 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, were arrested in the eastern France in April at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg.
The coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant attendants were arrested "without distinction", and has underlined that about a hundred of you were "always held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme colds with handshells and in seat position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to be welcomed to the spokesmen for one evening with candle light, taking part in the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators are driven by buses and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with heavenly blue rains, have made a first run in Copenhagen in the morning, since you have followed the call of the friends of the earth, "to form blue seasons" for the "climajustice".
Today we go to the streets to demand reimbursement of the environmental guilt in favour of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, Philippinian activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't continue to say that we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that are dry, water runs where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalisation critics has approached environmental organisations.
The European Member José Bové, the form of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "Climate Justice and Social Justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asian-Pacific area, where there are many islands that are particularly threatened as a result of heating, has given the starting shot for the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, some 50,000 people have gone to the streets.
In Manila there were hundreds of people, most of them students marching in red and hating bandanas, in which you have celebrated the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, Opmarchers of a few hundred demonstrants took place in order to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network have gathered some hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille, in the south, in Lille (Nord), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abchasien chose his president, Georgia denounces that it is a "stroke" here.
On Saturday, Abchasia chose his president, which happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognised this pro-Russian separatist Georgian area as independent, which was denoted Tbilissi the "strong".
Approximately 113,000 people were called on to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for the control of the South-Ossetian region, another Georgian sessionist area recognized by Russia.
The elections have closed GMT at 17 o'clock.
The participation in the election was about 58% a few hours before the election place, according to the Abchasian election Commissioner.
The first preliminary results should be announced in the night from Saturday on Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These choices are a Farce.
On the other hand, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abchasia is now subject to a safe total occupyment, explained his press speaker, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nikaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world recognizes it as a part of Georgia that is occupied by Russia.
After it was separated from Georgia during the 1992 - 1993 conflict, with a number of thousands of people dying, Abchasia wants to prove by this election that it is willing to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen for Herrn Bagapch.
She was one of the choosers who chose to choose in a electoral place that was in a school in the capital of Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palms before the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
The large signs on which the Bagapch is to be seen on the side of the Russian President and the Head of Government, Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are all in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the east of the country, the district chief Beslan Archba has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abchasian people, are grateful, he said, at a small celebration, as an indication of Moscow's support, especially as regards the decision to acknowledge Abchasia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, and raised a glass of Wodka.
The opposition of their side, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian business men, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements that were made with Moscow in the previous year, as those in Abchasien Russia left the control of the railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or opposition.
A majority of 50 % plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second election round must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding contract from the Kopenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready to work, about 700 people, arrested at the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives the delegations from 193 countries until 18 December, which are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where negotiations take place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the centre and did not try to induce.
A stage was built to welcome the predictors for one evening with candle light, taking part in the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators who were fully dressed in black and were armed with baking stones and hammers began to strike discs, a journalist of the AFP found.
Anti-unrust police have immediately circled you and have attacked without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police announced that 600 to 700 people were arrested and clarified that it was mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent divisions, which have already been famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, a policeman suffered an injury at the chicken during the incidents in which about twenty people were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in control," explained the police spokesman, Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the order forces created in the air.
Most demonstrators who drive by train or with their own vehicle from German large cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Korean, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the heavenly blue rainmantle, became in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group that should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we go to the street to demand that the ecological debts be paid back to people of the south," said the activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say, "We still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa there are rivers that sail, there are water runs through which you can run through what was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalisation amongst the environmental organisations has approached.
The French Member of the European Parliament and globalisation critic José Bové said to AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the fight against earth heating and the fight for another world."
The Organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turns to the masses.
The Asian-Pacific area, in which many islands are particularly vulnerable to earth heating, has proved to be an incentive for demonstrations.
In Australia, some 50,000 people have gone on the road according to the words of the organizers.
In Manila, some hundreds of people, in the majority of students, have dressed red with bandanas, before the city administration of the Philippinian capital for the sun's energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organized by the 350 network, several hundred people joined together, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
In Geneva several people gathered.
According to Chatel, the fields of geography and history are strengthened from the school reform of Lycéen.
The national Minister for Education Luc Chatel explained in an interview that appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the faculties of geography and history are strengthened from the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not obligatoryly informed in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th school year) now have every four weeks and the same programme," Mr. Chatel confirms.
For the minister "to be overcome this shine healing," because after him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but, in general, a concentration of "the best students".
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not be a subprofile of the scientific," he continued. He stressed: "I haven't heard many historians and intellectuals who had been disappointed by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lyces."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) criticizes the state project of removing obligatory teaching in history and geography in the terminal S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also misled this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the rights.
On the other hand, the Minister replied that there was no question about restricting the philosophy of the Terminals programme S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (studys and trade unions) had called on to protest against the project for Tuesday, which, in their opinion, would be the victim of the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister argued that they were undertaken in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year of an expert expertise examination and at the end of the year of an authorisation examination in which their educational capabilities are examined.
In addition, they conduct practices during the year in the M2 and then teach a year before the students as teachers in the practice.
He continued: "If you add all the practices offered before the performance test, you will reach more than 300 hours you spent before the students."
Finally, the Minister stated that he would like to offer "the individual right to education" - a "a matter that does not exist in public education."
He again confirmed that he wanted to cancel the school card "to 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normal Supérieures"
Fiveteen minutes to talk about the effort at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, faced at the Ecole Normal Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris on Saturday morning.
As a journalist of the AFP found, Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts turn to the audience with filmed contributions each for fifteen minutes.
One wants to do something to achieve people and in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students have given to the fish in the bassin of the school.
"The experts have been selected around the twenty discussion participants, even after their charisma," he explains.
"You can talk for hours for climate warming, but the key goals can also be explained in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, who spoke freely for about 50 people only with the help of films.
"This is part of our role as scientists," he stressed in the hope that listeners may find that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos rotated by these conferences will be found online on the school side from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will take place every two months.
Payment delay : angry prison guards, action planned
The unions of criminal officers called on Friday for a general action day in order to achieve the transfer of the premiums and overtimes of payments for budgetary reasons until January before Christmas celebration.
The second union of criminal officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire") invited employees who do not have a service to demonstrate and block them on Tuesday in front of the Criminal Department in order to pay attention to the "Styal of what they are allowed".
The 3rd Criminal Officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called on "to unite themselves to a strong mobilisation in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of the over-times, night allowances and sun- and holiday allowances will be marketed as "inappropriate and unacceptable" in December.
The first union of criminal officers, the Autonome Federal Criminal Organs Union (UFAP/UNSA), called on "allgemeine Mobilisation (...) to demonstrate insatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Criminal Institute and the Ministry of Justice explained that the overtimes have risen strongly in 2009 and not all of those in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the trade unions of criminal officers in which the payment is guaranteed in the next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to maintain and modernise our penalty system," the Minister of Justice announces in this letter.
"I have invited the management of the Criminal Institute to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen by lack of assessment of the overtime of attacks, does not repeat itself in the future," added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
Thus, the December wage is more magnificent, except for the management staff, which comes into the enjoyment of high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "containment thresholds" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional FO in Marseille, announced that "all congregations and calls" were to bonocott up to new instructions.
"The personnel does not go to work on Sundays and holidays if the hours of October are still not paid in December. This also applies to their overtimes," also the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne threatens.
"In a time when more and more tasks are being raised without more staff, the attempt to enrich the staff's money is more than inappropriate," says Bordeaux's CGT trade union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
However, in any case it is wrong, the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes he distributes Christmas always better gifts than he gets himself.
The American President, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas for the first time with his family in the White House, put out at the TV Talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he distributes more and more gifts than he gets himself.
At a special broadcast that was broadcast on the ABC channel on Sunday evening, the President and his wife Michelle gave insight how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrated home.
Even Bo, the small four leg companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama and adds that the dog of course also receives a gift.
Michelle Obama rejected her husband's claims on the quality of gifts. "I made you nice gifts last year," she nicked the president.
"Well, please," he shouted her shyly and pointed to the first lady's pearl chain, "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour radiation in an unforced atmosphere with the well-known TV modernator who had supported Barack Obama so violently during his election struggle, the President and his wife also talked about gifts that she had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten walks and also a basketball that his father, whom he had seen very rarely, had brought him to Christmas from Kenya.
"I remember when my father once visited us Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"First much later in my life, I understood that I had this ball from him."
The First Lady reminded her side of her puppen house.
"I didn't know at all how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace. But I loved this little puppen house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again surgery, RTL confirms that he was transferred into the artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles because of significant "skades" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was transferred into the artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was reoperated at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles in the night of Wednesday to Thursday, after the American doctors had detected "skades due to the operation of a band disc event," which he had suffered in Paris on November 26, so his production company in Paris, which added that these damages had made a re-operation necessary.
However, the Songer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the last tour of the singer, Johnny Hallyday was transferred into a artificial coma to avoid "smarts and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, there was a little more certainty about the condition of the patient when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "out of certain sources," that after his first operation in Paris, "non-no-drowing" was laid.
The rocker had been operated in Parc Monceau's international clinic because of a band disc incident.
The operation planned for several days was carried out by the neurologist Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments against TL.
After the operation by Johnny Hallyday, the singer was delivered in the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the operation.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was thinking toward RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley". However, he assured that you need "no concerns" to make the rock musician because this is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before his departure to Los Angeles. I told him it was silly to sit in a plane for twelve hours after such surgery, that's not going like that," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on the antibiotics" and that "the infection is reduced".
Mr Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the woman of the singer, and he had no particular concern.
Nevertheless, the concern for the singer’s health has grown increasing since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he fell on his yacht.
Two months later, the general surprise was that Johnny Hallyday had a "little darm cancer-OP" which led to a light infection.
At the end of September the singer took his long "Tour 66" as a departure tour as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented out. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer was trying to move on the stage.
Only in mid-November, the surrounded personnel had to claim a new delivery to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over his favorite distance
On Thursday the French Frédérick Bousquet, three-fold medal winner of the swimming world championships in 2009, took an international title on his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the shortway in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a true record flow was expected.
One record was improved by the Hungarine Evelyn Verrazto over 4 x 200 m and the two others by Russia at 4 x 50m locations of the men.
Shade for Bousquet, who wanted to take the 50m freestyle after the world record, whose record he held in the big basket (20.94).
At one of the two king's distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old French claimed in 20,53 sec., in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet forced the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to break the world record as planned (20.30).
"You can believe in increasingly larger and in this case I have said, if the world record is in my range, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits that are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their Epos in Istanbul, which started the same race for the first time in 1999.
The use of the combination has not been paid this time for the German Paul Biedermann, the two-fold world champion in the basket in Rome and the world record, at the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has carried out the second best time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew I couldn't get a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," said Biedermann.
United States : Grab plate estimated at Zola at 1.5 million US dollars
On Thursday, a Roman grave plate, which appeared at the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be 1.5 million US dollars, according to Sotheby's art dealer.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It comes from the IIIth century after Christ and has always been rated by $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysos are represented in a sophisticated architecture decor, surrounded by Satyren and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," explained Florent Heintz, Vice President for the proliferation of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, on Tuesday against AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still running, but this part is surely what the buyers have ordered most for so far," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this marble part by Emile Zola goes far down.
The record was nearly 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, and afterwards she appeared pieces for pieces at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found used for it in her bathroom in her Paris hotel and at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the III French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Petain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When searching the database of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the Fresko "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's trip from Hondura's direction Mexico has been eradicated
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the broken Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic ground no longer compatible after this lead by the Putsch government had rejected as inappropriate.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that was held in the evening, it seems that everything seems to be indicated that it is unanimous about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the immigration authority, the plane placed by the Mexican Government, which had arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transfering M. Zelayas, had returned to its destination.
The Putsch government wanted M. Zelaya to need a "respect" and to ask him for political asylum in abroad.
However, the abrupt President rejected this because he wanted to return to Mexico as the most fascinating Head of State.
The Putsch regime "has suffered a new failure by moving me to give up on my expenses (...), they wanted to take my mind," said on Thursday M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has frequently spoken since the beginning of the political crisis, which has been in the Mediterranean country for five months.
I can stay here well and like ten years, here I have my guitar, added the crashed President who had fled into the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some accords.
The Mexican message presented us a request for guidance, which we unfortunately cannot accept, as it did not include an asylum request, had explained on Wednesday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Putsch Government, to the Honduran Radio HRN.
I'm not looking for any country around asylum, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose seat is in Caracas.
A possible trip from Honduras, so he had underlined, he would only be the president of the Honduran people.
The rumours about a trip M. Zelayas had mobilized the followers of the crashed president, who had opened up to Brazilian message and gathered around them, and then the military there had increased its efforts.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch Government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who had attended the Socialist Venice President Hugo Chavez, was broken on 28 June, on the day of the referendum organized by him to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he was surprisingly returned on September 21 and had fled into the Brazilian message.
If he leaves this, he is imprisoned for high treasons, which he is accused of by justice, the Putsch Government.
The Putsch President Roberto Micheletti has managed to organise a presidential election on 29 November to dissolve M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the cogress had massively voted against M. Zelaya's return to the office until the end of his mandate on January 27th.
Wall Street in the upturn, the trade balance of the United States feeds optimism
On Thursday the New York Börse has completed with a high level, the figures of the American trade balance prove to be a course recovery of the shares of the United States as well as their partners: Dow Jones added by 0.67%, Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at stock closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10.405,83 points, the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended index of Standard & Poor ́s 500 was attributed to 1.102.35 points by 0.58% (6.40 points).
There are good news from different industries, judged Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotic under the prediction that the market is focused only on "half-glasses", so it measured.
According to Peter Cardillo by Avalon Partners, investors are primarily fixed on the numbers of the American trade balance, "which show an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit has decreased by 7.6% in October to $32.9 billion in relation to September.
In contrast, the analysts had calculated a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the main trade partners in the United States, commented Christopher Cornell from the company research Economy.com.
On the other hand, the unemployment in the United States has risen in the past week against all expectations and has now reached the status of 474,000 requests.
However, during the last four weeks, the average value of new work seekers had fallen "to the bottom of the year", pointed out by Scott Marcouiller by Wells Fargo Advisors.
The obligation market has dropped.
The profitability of government loans to 10 years has increased to 3.482% compared to 3.432% from the day of service, the profitability of loans to 30 years to 4.492% versus 4.408% from the evening before.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans standing in power pifies "Dames in Weiss" out
Some hundreds of Cuban parties, on Thursday, took out the women gathered in Havana for the purpose of the Day of Human Rights of the World, of political prisoners and also poured another clergy, because of which a good dozen dissident was temporarily arrested.
For the fourty "dames in Weiss", wives or nearby political prisoners, on the open street of the government's partisans under Raul Castro, just when they were in the center of the capital in order to demand the liberation of political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "It lives fidel and Raul!" the authorized parties shamed against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "protect their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "dames in Weiss" had played in Havana in the evening, where there was no injured or arrested.
On the other hand, a dozen dissident, who also held the demonstration on Thursday in view of the International Day of Human Rights, was temporarily arrested by civil police, confirmed by a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents of the government's partisans to enter civil vehicles with violence.
The temporary imprisonment of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As observers on the prices given by the European Parliament in 2005, the "dames in Weiss" have organised an unacceptable postponement for the purpose of "Please for the release of all political prisoners", whose number, according to dissident list, is about 200, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda puts a 20-year prison sentence.
M. Maceda belongs to the group of 75 cuban dissidents in prison in March 2003, of which 53 are behind grids until the date.
The Cuban authorities feel that the regiments are "solders" or "agents" in the service of the declared archephen, the United States.
It is a remarkable fact that Cuban television was reporting on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between military pro-regulation fighters and "Contra-revolutionary" reports.
The Cuba, led by a unity party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused of European or American NGOs of defeating rights and freedoms, especially of freedom of speech.
Angry kills eighty-year-olds with the knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
One with two knives armed madness killed an eighty-year-old man on Friday at late afternoon at the main business time in the interior city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Huts-de-Sine) and injured five more people.
According to the first inquiry, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old in or before a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, accordingly, police statements, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is indicated by an agent of the Alliance Police Syndikat in the hospital, the consequences of his injuries.
In or before the same pharmacy, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the three stars, attacked and was hurt.
The first two victims were delivered seriously to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured is in danger of life, since he, according to police sources, appears to have been affected by vital organs.
The pregnant woman has become bad because of the events and is supposed to have been hospitalized in a police source in shock state.
The armed man, who appeared to be under alcohol or drug influence after police statements, should immediately have escaped on the street, like the Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passengers, apparently randomly: a three-seven and a fifty-year-old, with the last of both difficult.
The scenario remained in darkness in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knifes, which he was crossed behind his back, explained at the place Arnaud Pressé, an accountant of the Syndikat Alliance of the area Hauts-de-Sine.
Several passengers, including young people, are supposed to have tried to bind the crazy ones according to the witness reports of the AFP.
I've seen a guy in the three stars with a green west.
Three youths tried to intervene.
They didn't do it because the guy was well built, Alberto reported, a cellar of a nearby bar.
A horn fell over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke the wrist.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city policemen, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife, so police information.
The event has been played in one of the main strikes of Clichy-la-garenne, where there is a number of shops.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there's a injured person in there.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I brought them in the first-help setting and noticed a clapping wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, AFP.
Five minutes later a second, about thirty-year-old person came injured by cutting wounds.
The police's forces have finally arrested the man who had no certificate documents with him.
The State Attorney of Nanterre has commissioned the District Representative of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92).
The madman has been hospitalized on Thursday.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been courted.
A police source does not imply that he is delivered into a nerve health facility.
According to another police source, six policemen had to bind him to the Clichy Police Commission, where he had been taken away.
He was "in a state of persuasion" like "all spiritually confused of this kind, with which the forces are released during the tathers".
United States: Polanskis Advocate calls for a resumption of criminal prosecution
The French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski prosecuted repeatedly on Thursday in Los Angeles, California, western United States, to leave the criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his residence in Switzerland due to a moral disposition of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the director of the "Pianist", in the second district of California, in 1977, three judges of the Tribunal in charge of serious trial errors at the time of negotiating.
I call for a criminal release, M. Hummel explained before he added that at the time of negotiation with the case of Judge Laurence Rittenband, the behaviour of the case was "to the back of a cold".
He believed that the Judge - who died - had discussed the Rittenband before he fell his judgeship with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a breeding house -- which represents a grave trial error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), especially by the contested state lawyer David Wells.
M. Wells had finally explained at the end of September that the authors of the documentary film were "belogened".
If the Court refuses to initiate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel requests the leadership of a process which would enable him to present the evidence of his argument.
On the other hand, the accusation has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the withdrawal of the acts brought to the charge of the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before court.
The 76-year-old director had fled from the United States in 1978 before the announcement of the penalty for illegal sexual relations with a 13-year-old.
Since this time, he hasn't traveled to the United States.
The Deputy State Prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had explained that Roman Polanski had to be "da to attend the negotiation".
Do you want to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski), but also to other accused people that escape is an opportunity to escape? asks Mrs Asayma.
They believe that "the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and thus despises his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days of time to announce their decision – even pointed out that there were other escape alternatives.
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the termination of criminal prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the termination of the criminal proceedings again.
She recalled that her client would no longer endure to be offended by any resurrection of Affaire Polanski and added: "None in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Twenty-third years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on 26 September, on the launch of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind grids, he was then sentenced to his Chalet in Gstaad, in expectation of any delivery to the house arrest.
Wall Street is bremsed by the increase of the dollar and ends without a course.
The New York Börse closed on Friday without a course, in a market which was broken down and down between better indicators than planned in the United States and an increase in the dollar: Dow Jones won 0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10.471,50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has returned 0.5 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended index standard & Poor's 500 has risen by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"In fact, the market is quite quiet," Mace found sight silver by Marblehead Asset Management.
"He remains closely limited, the volume of trade has become very small and I think that this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned to "contribute to improving market views on the solidarity of economic recovery," the analysts of Charles Schwab summarised.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, thus two months behind each other and far more than planned.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers in December has been significantly improved to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes were bremsed by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest level compared to the euro for two months, thus pressing down 'the sectors that are vulnerable to the economic situation', explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost somewhat in the ground.
The obligation market has declined.
The return of the taxpayer over 10 years has risen by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482% and the loan over 30 years to 4.497% versus 4.492% of the spring.
Choice of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of travel through South Africa, the 112 candidates to the title of Miss World will cross the last obstacle on Saturday to fulfill their dream: to be chosen to be the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this before a billion television.
During this great beauty fair, which is organized for the second time in the area of Johannesburg, five of them have already picked up their ticket to halffinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were cured to Miss Sportive or Miss Top model during her African stay.
This was a true strudel of pleasures.
Beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn were just extraordinary.
I've seen many things and made a lot of experiences! said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and is transferred live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 15 a.m.
I couldn't imagine a nicer country to give up my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova underlined in the warmth of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the re-decognition of "atmospheric landscapes".
After a month of Galas, samples, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss is now focusing on competition.
The Inderne Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, which was chosen in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as to imitate Aishwarya Rai, which was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, it is the dream of every woman to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about the appearance here.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th issue is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defile in traditional traits and not to forget, in the bathroom suit.
The idea is presented by a TV-moderator, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean and by a member of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is the world with a barely excessive warmth and pride to receive, assures Julia Morley, Chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, have made a safari, which visits famous township in Soweto, but this time they cost the bicycle and the local kitchen.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma was exceptional, who gave them the hand.
Not usual for a Head of State, Miss Sierra Leone noticed.
Their most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the elimination in Cape Town (Southwest) to football world championship in June 2010, a kind of country, to advertise a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I'd probably never get closer to.
I will certainly return to the World Championship in 2010, enthusiastically promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
According to his son David, the news about Johnny Hallyday are "very positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday are "very positive", his son David insisted on Friday at his arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news are very positive.
He's very strong, it's going very well, David Hallyday explained the press at the exit of the plane, where he arrived from Paris shortly after 13 o'clock (21 o'clock MEZ).
The son of the singer, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would be "fastest" to Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered in Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection after surgery on 26 November.
The singer was placed "this night in Los Angeles in a artificial coma to relieve his strong pain and carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to a artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars-Synai hospital in Los Angeles, in which he was delivered in Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection after a band disk operation on November 26th.
The singer had to undertake a surgery again in the night from Wednesday on Thursday due to the diseaseful changes caused by the last operation.
His wife Laeticia participated on Friday tomorrow in a school event in the French gymnasium of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade went to school, a photographer of the AFP found.
The head of the department for orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer severely burdened the neuro surgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated the singer in the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26th.
We were told that he made the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely discomforted, explained Mr. Camus.
I heard that you might be going to initiate a court proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "is a lot too fast and this has been done with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally phoned this doctor, who assured me that he viewed this trip as completely unproblematic, which had surprised me very, since I already have two band drive operations behind me myself, he added.
Shortly before, he announced at RTL that the singer seemed to have left the hospital after the surgery "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in the artist's environment.
He had operated the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Sine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007 he had also operated the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematome after a brain bleeding.
But he is also a doctor with doubtful reputation, who has already been sentenced several times because of misleading operations and not to forget, due to tax withdrawal and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the medical chamber, referred to him as "a man without screaming" who has "regular responsibility" before the board and is "all other things as recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday on his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This one explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "reduced no bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have occurred since last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is clear that on 8 January (in Amiens) it is a little too small for continuing the tour, said Mr Camus.
The UDF Party Association (Union for French Democracy) becomes strong and calls on the Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal.
On Friday, the party association, which is monitored by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, has reacted heavily on a proselyte of the seal, the party founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the sides of the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and invited him to use this seal to no more.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take over this UDF seal because he believed that François Bayrou would not be worth defending this political inheritance after reaching the left hand.
The Defence Minister, whose party is the UMP, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To emphasise his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (the former UMP, now at NC), who claimed the property of the UDF brand, since he was the first to request this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industriale".
However, the business office of the party associations of UDF, who were monitored by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they were not dismissed and set a deadline to the minister and to the Member, under the threat of judicial persecution, to no longer use this seal and to transfer it to the property rights of the brand.
In the last days, you have made numerous statements that you would propose your political movement to take over the UDF seal+, the Party Association wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem Party and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the Central Association.
You probably also believed that you had the right to let the name of this movement +Nouveau center+, the slogan + of today's UDF +, print on their political material as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF's business office explained and urged the NC party to "remove the name UDF without delay from all materials and (your) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette called on "to transfer the property rights of the brand to their legal rights".
If you refuse this, we will raise a complaint against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full political movement since 1978, remembering that Morin and his friends "had made the choice" to leave them in 2007 in order to establish a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to establish the party "UMP".
The Nouveau Centre therefore, according to the signatories, has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They continue to remember that the last UDF convention in 2007 adopted the three-year membership of the MoDem Party as well as the establishment of a business office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the company continues, "he was at the time when he requested the brand name, no longer member of the UDF" but the UMP for three years.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of retention of the UDF acronym to do this for himself.
In addition, you should remember that this insightlessness is in the best way to turn into a crime, and ironise the strategy of the NC: "In politics as well as in life, it appears more delicate to make yourself a name rather than to try to come out of anonymity by entering a name in a deceitful way that you do not have any legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier is sentenced for the exploitation of weaknesses
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionary Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has used a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to swallow herself some of her assets.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to be responsible on 15 and 16 April 2010 for the exploitation of weaknesses before court, a crime that is committed with a three-year freedom penalty and a penalty of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this Affaire, which is worthy of the Saga one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter feed themselves and at the same time have the throats of the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly conducted by three doctors.
The Erbin and the main shareholder of L'Oréal have so far refused to undertake such an investigation, in particular not under the conditions submitted by Nanterre State Prosecutor.
The doctors appointed on Friday should still submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which you will clearly announce whether and when Liliane bedencourt may have been found in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I'll talk to her, explained the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me George's Kiejman, after the trial.
As regards the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady that you need to protect, he confirmed.
For two years the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artists, and accuses him of having used the weaknesses of her mother for years in order to swallow a total of EUR one billion in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt had always rejected being manipulated by a photographer who she views as a long-year-old friend.
Although the court had to examine the reliability of the complaint initiated by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaidoyers of the lawyers led to a large family debug on Friday.
So the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called for three letters sent by his client to her notar (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she mistrust the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Would you please explain to my daughter that I had written to Banier for fifteen years, one to twice a day.
Françoise I have never been able to speak again since her marriage."
The State Attorney of Nanterre is again of the opinion that the applicant had no right to react in such a way, in particular because a preliminary judge has rejected her application to initiate a judicial protection procedure against her mother in the last days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legally capable, is not under protection and has no support.
Nobody has the right to act in her place," the representative of the State Attorney, Marie-Christine Daubigney, confirmed.
The Court has now decided to make a judgment after the process of admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of strategic early information?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies with regard to its employees, the position of the consumers before the marketing revolution said: It is the best for the staff to join "values" as it was previously designed to be linked to consumer products by the technicians in the work.
By giving the customers in the centre of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors preferences of the customers again regularly!
Demobilisation of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the top of a much larger phenomenon, which especially affects the employees.
This demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, in particular on those of R & D, which is even more decisive, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) demands a proactive approach and a future-oriented viewpoint of all the parties involved; it claims that the employees are invited to reverse the instructions of the authoritarian management.
That is why we call on an operational revolution that would consist in putting the employees in the middle of the business's concerns equally right next to the customers.
The very related benefit of internal opinion
Will the internal questionnaires, such as the questionnaire that Orange has submitted to its reward recipients, stimulate this revolution in relation to the management practices?
I'm afraid I'm not.
- First of all, because I could find that in view of a new situation, all the vessels are finally attained to do this... whatever it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to its own failure.
And finally because most leaders have a strongly simplified idea of human behavior.
Their interpretation of psychology is mechanical from the major engineering schools.
They take the old behavioral theory by intellectual comfort, which recently was reactivated by the U.S. "Neuro sciences" and unawarely widespread by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to engage the "heaven" (sic) in the involvement of employees, a current survey published by Ipsos strengthens the leaders in a position to a mechanical control system which is inappropriate to the present world.
Identifying and measuring the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It is to integrate in any consideration or practice of control a basic protocol: for the beneficiaries, the commitment for the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to achieve a part of its dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take this conception of motivation of employees.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their company on the basis of a given Doxa, which allows them to assess what it offers to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilisation factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and preclude their "social performance" and relocate their human resource management at the right place.
Thus they create a fruitful soil that is beneficial to the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speech of Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from right
On Friday, the American rights welcomed the speech held by Barack Obama in Oslo and was satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 defended the term "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who had ridiculed the award of the price to Obama on 9 October applauded this time the President's speech, the example of the former Vice-President's candidate in the 2008 elections of Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wings of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today, adding that she had spoken to herself the subject of a "many times necessary" war in memoirs published so far.
The war, of course, is the last one I think the Americans want to do it, but he is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars by his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, believed that the priest had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I felt that the speech was really good, the former president of the representative house, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of the wicked in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, Ginrich, who was consulted in the "The Takeaway" radio, was quite historic.
The previous Member, considered as a possible candidate for the republikan nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was happy to have seen a "president of the Left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "not were free and could not deliver a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama held "a very American speech".
In addition to representing himself as "cosmopolit", as "he always does," he said "as a American president," when he pointed out that the Europeans live "as in a safety bubble that they did not create themselves and do not much for whose protection they did," said Gerson.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, the former UN messenger John Bolton, a fall of the era Bush, referred to on the National Review Online website as "saving, high-treating and uninspired".
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the rejection of the forces.
If you pack the war under the cover of justice, the massacre can simply justify the innocents, he warns.
However, the press of the fair left remains praiseful on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, who still believes that the Nobel Prize was forgiven to Obama, called the speech itself for a speaker like him who is known for his talent as "monumental work".
The speech in Oslo "does offer a plan to control international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression", says the California daily newspaper enthusiastic.
The New York Times believes that Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and referred to his speech as "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Telecommunications: Three Marathons for an agreement to ensure Christmas supply
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the trade unions of the street association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening that ends the strike command and the threatening heavy supply break at Christmas.
At the signature session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State responsible for transport, Dominique Bussereau, "greeted" the agreement which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several negotiating weeks.
After a second night of negotiation, the negotiators separated themselves early on Friday morning in the hope that the agreement should be signed quickly in the late morning.
And this even though the three employer associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours went from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 p.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and the agreement was signed only at 18:00 p.m.
The conflict "was very harmful to the company" and "it was to be afraid that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The rate of hours for workers with the lowest wages rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we'll start small first," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now instructed to stop blocking the supply centres.
"There will probably always be some opposing persons who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
The TLF Chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although "it was difficult to admit these wage increases in the face of international competition".
Accordingly, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on the healthy human mind and respect for the employees," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) spoke in this regard about "a acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides for the increase in travel costs by 3 %, as well as the maintenance of the total rate for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable the issue of the 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of tariff agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the lowering of the taxes for employers of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the Government to the draft legislation of the corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on Thursday to Friday on the night.
The government calls for "a identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to the undertakings associated with this organisation and to then apply to the whole profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", insures Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only extend the procedure.
The UNTR Association prevailed on a "failing trade" because the 100 million euros "was already promised to the sector to compensate a part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but in order not to treacher the Gans-Esses at the nearest Christmas days, Unostra complains.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens "to shake a large grave to the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disorders this weekend, trade unions with the RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest railway network in France for the Great Space of Paris and the Île-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independence of the Paris passenger transport management), the strikers can continue to wait with their demands for wages.
At this important shopping week before Christmas there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central line was ready to use only one of four trains.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, which forced travellers to walk around.
The purchase house chain of Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to link the large businesses technically".
The line RER A crosses the Paris balling space from the west to the east.
The route section of the RATP connects Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of the two trains to the main time of traffic was planned, and almost no one during the low time of traffic.
As already on Thursday there was no man's wound on the highway as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had looked at the situation.
As early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) had been far less overrun than otherwise, especially because of the lack of gymnasians.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), he would be extra "one and a half hours earlier to get to work in time".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide travellers with officials and order forces, pointed out that there had not been any entrances in Saint-Lazare train station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-huut came to or went over Saint-Lazare train station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday the main meetings of the strikers were again held, while the results of the associations had been reviewed after the meeting with the leadership headquarters on Friday afternoon.
The RER employer proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career courses, etc.
However, that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they require a long-term wage allowance.
The CGT was discouraged that the RATP itself puts their wage supplements in clamps and stressed that the leadership tip "is not able to solve a problem while this was possible for the remote drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP made it clear that a new meeting for the "complete examination of working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
On the morning, about 150 drivers sought the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership point that by the date refused any discussion during the strike, and attended a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend itself to the RER B line after an announcement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations require a wage allowance from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, from which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain about the worsening of the working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are on their daily journey.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, cover a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros and a salary of 600 to 650 euros for layer services and sun and holidays.
The Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves the pro-kurdic party.
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court announced the resolution of the pro-Curdian main party of the country; a decision followed by the imminent demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the government's work extremely difficult, which seeks to reach the hand of the Kurdish Community to put an end to the conflicts that have been during the last 25 years.
The "Partei for a Democratic Society" (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become a "state for activities that are harmful for the independence of the state and its independence", said the President of the Constitutional Court of Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been made unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to retain the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including President Ahmet Turk and Parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for five years.
In addition, the judge announced the withdrawal of parliamentary immunity, which enjoys Turkish and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the goods of the party.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the judgment that the parliamentaries would prefer to leave Parliament rather than to meet as non-participants.
The decision followed a procedure initiated by the State Prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007. He accused the DTP to follow the "visions" of the Kurdistan Labour Party (PKK), which is regarded as terrorist organisation by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party insists on "no connection" to PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court of First Instance between the Government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish Community and proposes a number of measures to strengthen the rights of Kurds in order to let the support of the PKKs be seen by the Kurds and to put an end to conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a re-emission of tensions in South-East anatolia, where many demonstrations against the arrest conditions of the PKK-Chef Abdullah Öcalan have led to collapses with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators gathered before the spaces of the DTP in the million city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, mainly populated by Kurden.
The order forces used tear gases and waterlights when the demonstrators began to throw molotovcocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the judgment, Turk assumed that the court's decision will "more deepen despair".
"Turkish can't clarify this question (Curdish, Ann. d. editorial) on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, consisting of a party resulting from Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose principle against the conclusion of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," said energy minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpeding of the democratic opening that was promoted by the government," said the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"There is obviously a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK became an attack that killed seven soldiers in the north of Turkey three days before, which was one of the most brutal attacks in the past months.
The snow breaking can come
A really tricky winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not just because he wants to siculate the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
Especially so that his employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
In the weekend it could be so far, according to meteorologists for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is following a precise plan.
As soon as it cuts surfacely in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degree, 20 so-called A-stages are run with large-stroke vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include main roads such as the New Road and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire-guides, ÖPNV routes, walking zones and routes with accidents such as the Atzelberg Street.
The service of the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning
The about 1040 kilometres need to be scattered in a maximum of three hours of moisture salt, which is better responsible.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until professional traffic starts".
It'll be difficult if it cuts at 7.30 p.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because nobody is ready to make space for the straw vehicles".
Only afterwards, if it does not go on cutting, the routes of delivery and closure, including the Council-Beil Street, are in the series.
The last priority has side and side roads.
There will be complaints, white Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the footvolk of the FES is on the way, danger points and transitions are primarily cleared.
The FES could usually not take care of all the bicycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that primarily keeps the bridges in the eye from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
As there is on this fast sheet, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the rush is on the way.
If necessary, this is also called by the police.
The Ways of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-freshing dinosaurs: The two meters long and 1.50 meters large animal ran on two strong back legs, had a long tail with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with seals and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Science magazine from Thursday.
The animal lived some 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which was then in a dry area of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window for the early evolution of the dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relatives, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began to dig on the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaurs knocks on one day, which is unfor example for detentions from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new kind.
In the course of the excavation, they brought together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theory about Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" is the god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaurier fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly you find only single pieces."
Other dinosaurian experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
The dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago, after the current teaching point.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, why the allocation of these Ur-Dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts discuss when the eches split themselves into their three main development lines: the meat-freshing theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and the birds known as "Langhalse" and their relatives, and the plants fertilizing Ornithischia (Vogelbecksauriers), including the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropode.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found references to air bags, as they also possess the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine seemed to be partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primitive theropode with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant saropods later also owned air bags and light-building knobs, the common ancestors of both groups likely had produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the primitivest dinosaurs ever lived in South America, the researchers follow that the eches appeared there for the first time.
Thus, the three development lines were early and spread from South America over all parts of the earth, which then, as a supercontinent Pangaea, were one country mass.
That is why the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot originate from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three migration waves to North America, Alan Turner says from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-writer of the Science Study.
Of course there are also contradictions.
An even older type, Silesaurus, belonging to a group of dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the bonner paleontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted picture because in South America just a lot of primitive dino phosphiles have remained, while there is little to find on other continents.
As the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant farming of the earth’s medieval age, it is still ridiculous.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs still shared their living room with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flying auries and with many more eczes.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while relatives at the border from the Trias to the jura died.
Success history was not forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs survived randomly, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could put the competition out of the field.
The success story was not forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite attack of a group of animals helped to flower, which had also developed in the Trias, and since then a shadowed it: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto are on the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Docents from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the occupied casino of the Frankfurter Goethe University strikes waves worldwide.
278 Professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarizing with the protesting students at the Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" the police action made by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had left the building occupied by students and teachers in the educational strike last week because walls and artworks had been shamed.
Five students were injured.
The damages, the signatories, did not justify "the violent resolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by means of a police command".
The space represents a "non-acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on Vandalism is "deligimating and criminalising the protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau has withdrawn the necessary discourse.
The teachers require the immediate attitude of criminal persecution.
The majority of the occupants did not support the damage to the matter, says it.
Protest legitimated
The Youth of the trade union Verdi and the German trade unions are also solidarizing with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi-Landesjugend Secretary Alexander Klein.
However, Hessen's Minister for Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the procedure of uni-president and police.
We are grateful to the Uni-President.
Destruction and occupying are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have understanding of the protest, but we do not understand Vandalism, so the CDU country-day member Peter Beuth.
Otherwise, the opposition fractions saw SPD, Green and Left.
The CDU takes painted walls to the preamble to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of students, it has been cleared.
The left has submitted a request to the Minister of Inland to report on the police action.
New Silicon Valley
Long years she was considered a secret city, unavailable for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, was a strictly monitored location for secret armament research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had linked contacts to the Frankfurt Sciences Standplatz Riedberg - with the Uni Institutes and the Firms of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits, and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation".
The Moscow Vice Mayor Juri Rosljak and the Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd introduced the Russian delegation, signed Edwin Schwarz for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is a continual scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to take foot on the growing Russian market.
Inversely, Russian scientific companies want to collect contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronics, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armament research.
Selenograd (orally translated "Grünstadt") received his name from the forested hill landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than the depth of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will decay the city of the Baden-Wurttembergian national capital for a decade in a wholeless construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 has been created from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headway stations with rails that end in the middle of the city were then considered as transport engineering fossils of the 19th century, which seemed like brake clutches of a modern rail transport, since it once took a huge amount of time to span Lokomotives from back to front.
Get in, hold in, go on, go, go, go, go.
And that's why the headquarters should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a doorway station, which is about halfway from the trans-European rail magistrale between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - therefore the slogan of the "Christian" of Europe.
S21 is now actually approached, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost unpaid in the Hessian and the Bavarian capital to implement the depth.
However, headquarters have no longer a problem with entrance and exit since there are modern turns with motor vehicles and trucks at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 nebst of the ICE new building line to Ulm is now being started.
National and municipal politicians have implemented it.
The railway is involved, also because the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project of the Republic of Taxpayers and not the State Groups.
The project is still somewhat justified by urban construction.
There are new city spaces that - you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - are equipped with a lot of green.
For the rail transport system, S21 is harmful.
The passport station and the route expansion are intended for the passenger traffic that is attributed to enormous growth - typically the 1980s.
At that time there was not yet the competition of the cheap flyers.
However, modern transport policy must first be aimed at strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is significantly more environmentally friendly than per truck on the road.
However, the reconstruction line does not take place for goods trains due to intense increases.
Even more serious is that S21 indirect also tangates many other railway projects.
More than six billion euros are to be banned in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion realistic.
Stands firm, the next decade the money will be missing on other nodes and intersections in the network.
A total of 60 larger projects are listed in the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180 kilometres long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the trass has been built in time.
Urgently, it would be necessary to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake scratch.
The Rheintal line becomes a bottleneck for international freight: in the heart of Europe.
Government verifys judgment on the airport
In Wiesbaden's Landtag, the national government has left open whether it will go into review against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court of Justice (VGH) to the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to make the more than 400 pages of VGH judgment legally examined, said economic minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
On that day, the VGH in Kassel had writtenly justified that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest railway in Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-recover the night flight ban.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 a.m., as provided for by the national government, should not be agreed with the lawful protection of the population from night-to-night flight noise.
The coalition must decide until 4 January whether it is against the judgment in review.
The opposition criticized this postponement and insisted on the government representatives to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD Group Head Torsten Schäfer-Gumbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered as a "written break".
It's fucking hard if you can keep your word, Green-Chef Tarek Al-Wazir said to the FDP Walking Log "We keep Word".
Minister Posch rejected the presumption of Schäfer-Gumbel, attempting the national government to come to their night flights with "right distortion and trickiness".
A precise legal test takes her time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally secure decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they show the opposition, the statements of his group have never been for a night flight ban.
US banks pay back help
The crisis-shaped US large banks cut off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America paid the aid from the Bank Rescue Fund Tarp from a total of $45 billion (EUR 30 billion) to a hit.
And the Citigroup also plans to reimburse State aid after a report by the US-Sender CNBC.
The institutions want to resolve the limitations that have been taken into account with the adoption of the money, such as the limitation of the payment of managerboni and the removal of high charges.
The Bank of America had made some 19 billion dollars of fresh money for investors.
The rest of the sum took it out of her own box, which was well filled by spare sales, among other things.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money spray has helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had raised itself to the peak of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the Investment Bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also intends to obtain money on the capital market to liberate from its liabilities to the State.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce an increase of around $20 billion of its capital, reported CNBC, calling on circles.
A Citigroup speaker didn't want to speak.
In June Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their help.
Fast election
It went faster than you thought.
Shortly two weeks after the ZDF Management Board had forced the official Chief Redaktor Nikolaus Brender out of the office, the sender can present a successor.
Last night, the body wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin, was a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the sender - officially in order not to preclude the procedure.
However, it is likely that this proposal should not be implemented by the Board of Directors, however, to avoid any further damage to ZDF intendent Markus Skachter.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members.
The result of the vote was not yet established at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years, the treasurer failed in the Board of Directors.
Only seven members spoke to Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's departure was a contemporary defeat for treasurers, but a expectable one.
For the majority of the Union in the Management Board had been signalling weeks before the election that Brender would not want to confirm in the Office.
Organized had the opposition to the Chief Redactor of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that the ZDF's communications had lost the switch ratios under Brender, he rejected another term of office of the high-speed Chief Redaktor.
So until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was beaten.
Lastly, 35 national lawers had been involved in the debate, which regarded the procedure of Koch as unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do with.
To person
Peter Frey was born in Bingen on August 4, 1957.
He studied politics, pedagogics and romantics.
Afterwards he worked at the Southwest Television and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey switched to ZDF, first to the "now-day journal".
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal representative of the Chief Redacter; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and leader of the Morgue Magazine; until 2001 head of the ZDF External Policy; since the head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after the abstract of Brenders, which was elected by the Medium Magazine industry on Wednesday to the journalist of the year.
Kochs Widepart in the Board of Directors, Rhinenland-Pfalz Minister Kurt Beck, stated last week that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that staff proposals of the Interpretant cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the ZDF supervisory bodies also excluded Beck.
Brender's expected follower Peter Frey had recommended the Board of Directors with a wise chess-- by he strongly criticizing the body immediately after the Brander election.
Thanks to this document of journalistic independence, he could nominate both treasurer without face loss for the posts of the Chief Redactor and choose the board without suspecting to put a partygate into the office.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is counted to the left liberals.
Study Destroyed
Part success for the students: After a year of educational strike, the Cultus ministers of the countries finally joined on Thursday: at a meeting of Cultural Ministers and Higher Professors Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
The students should be able to handle their study in the future.
Individually, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module should only be completed with a single test.
In addition, the work burden of students is to be reviewed and ensured "a realistic and reliable measure".
Politics and universities also aim to simplify the recognition of audits between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structures for Bachelor and Master studies more flexible.
In addition, there should be no different national schemes.
Reduce tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Cultus Ministers and Uni-Rektors have carried the poultry word from the better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests partially drastically: "Every module usually concludes with only one test," says in a 30-sided paper to partially re-regulate the approval of study courses.
With the "decisive reduction of the test load," the President-in-Office of the Akcreditation Council, Reinhold Grimm said, a "failing development should be offered a sustainability that significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, the "studyability" is to be "the crucial criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content are "strength to check on it", whether "necessary unifications of students in choosing the
Events would be avoided.
The students would have "recommendation to receive playgrounds, allow and promote own initiatives".
The rules for the approval of new studies, but also for the review of existing studies, are to be applied.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means that it takes until 2015 until all studies have been reviewed.
It is advisable that ten accreditation agencies under the council of accreditation established by the countries are in abundance.
In October, the Ministers of Cultural Affairs had called on the countries to intervene in such a way as to ensure that the material filling is not too large and the test regime is not too strict.
In individual federal countries, universities and high schools have already agreed with the Ministry of State on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Pfalz added additional funding for the further development of the Bologna process.
Money is intended to set up higher education programmes and to strengthen study advice, audit and foreign offices.
Country and universities want to spend ten million euros for this purpose.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a novelle of the higher education law into Parliament.
Accordingly, only one test is needed for the completion of a study model.
The study design is to be more flexible, also to ensure the recognition of performance evidence at other universities and to facilitate access to the master.
By the end of the next year, all studies in the country are to be reviewed for their studyability.
Government and opposition had again disputed on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso High School Groups called for the design of education policy to no longer take place "after closed doors" of the Ministers and Higher School Directors.
After the educational strike, the students who are involved should now speak "a word with them".
The future academics received support from the president of the Higher Institute Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Cultural Ministers with whom the HRK advised on a joint reform document.
The trade union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough to make the Bonner decisions: it demands a legal claim which enables each graduate with a Bachelor Final access to a further master course.
Secondly, the countries must ensure that the present generation of Bachelor students are sufficiently available in the morning with the best possible study conditions, says GEW Board member Andreas Keller.
The countries need to set a significant increase in dozents.
However, the Ministers of Cultus did not express themselves to a more free access to the Master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Entry into Germany and out is pretty almost no control..." is the starting line of a poem of the Lyriker Werner Söllner, in which this one in disturbing language foots then tematizes the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom, but at the same time lost his speech room.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a teacher in a children's book publisher before transferring to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded with various literature prices, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetics lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian literature forum in the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
On the last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, he took care of a significant extraliterative look at "German literature in Romania in the mirror and cereals of its securitate acts".
Söllner was visiblely unsured and disposed of a statement in which he competed to Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, as an IM for the Romanian Secret Service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendants, Söllner had received the German language price in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had started smoothly, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner closed, "so someone who didn't fight the securities' intimidation attempts enough."
The Lyrik Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Closely at the same time as the Nobel Prize Honoration for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorship, the literature scene, and in particular the Community of the German authors originating in Romania, is shaken by a case which makes known the reasons and deduction of a political system based on surveillance and constituency.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge, not only the offenders but also the victims.
In his Securitate Act, IM Walter played a role, said Söllner's confession of literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter.
He's been putting him out in all different points for him then, Markel said.
It is a moral need for him to make this note.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in the form and before this audience, but totally surprising is not the confession of an earlier dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for securitate splashes, Herta Müller had already written in July in time after reading her own document, 914 pages.
The affected, so you may suspect, are speculated and, in some cases, have known which clear name hid behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
Unlike the very procedural sighting of the Stasi Acts, the treatment of the securitate surveillance surveillance is still very diffus.
Systematic information has been deprived and hindered in recent years.
One of the Birthler Officers of the relevant National Council for the Preparation of Securitate Acts (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, but the release of the documents has been rather slow since.
Only since 2005 there is a law regulating the management of the documents.
The fact that the influence of former securitate members in Romania is still very large, after announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, showed an interview in which an earlier securitate chief of Temesvar abruptly expressed himself over the pricing lady.
She's got a psychosis. Finally, they've only been questioned once.
The infamity of power was meant to be quite unfamiliar in the form of freedom of speech.
Surely, the case of Söllner, as often in connection with weakened guilt, is inevitable.
Why not now? Who has been hurt? The sensible reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession makes hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more of knowledge than of guilt and shame.
To the geneses of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than one footnote.
saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if the new VfB trainer Christian Gross, along with an orange plastic suite of the equipment, went up a quarterly hour after midnight to a climbing C class.
The man with the marking glaze was chopped because of his foreign town.
Otherwise he could also have driven himself - alcohol wasn't at last in the game, and lost before luck the 55-year-old was as little.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work is just going on.
Or get out of here.
In the words of the Swiss only three days before, "we have reached the eight-final," in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 result against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves bleak out of the success: it will be a brutal harsh fight against the descent."
The "many more important task" stands ahead on Sunday.
Then it is true to repeat the royal class performance in Mainz in the Liga-Alltag.
And the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three gates through Marica (5.), draw (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Exemption
The eight-final of the Champions League (incorporation 16./17. + 23./24 February/backplay 9./10. + 16./17. March) is released in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the fulminant state of the Babbel follower remained.
Not only the suspicious healer who in the short time gave the insured Stuttgarter Profis self-confidence, willingness to use and joy to play.
I went to the players and told them that they should reflect on their strengths, and had stopped them to be more courageous, explained the soulnklempner Gross the simple success recipe, which had no effect under the therapist Babbel.
He has made a certain magic, admitted Babbel-proposer Jens Lehmann, "when there is a new impulse in the football, things happen sometimes that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, thanks to his dynamics, was just the best player on the spot, tried to describe the discovered "fresh wind" and the work of the new supervisor: "He is a man who is striving through and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the present situation."
Under Babbel, it had obviously been lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns sports board Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs a constance.
Like Gross, players and managers also avoided to overevaluate the victory against a weakened and completely excessive restraint of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil wake, gave Khedira to think.
And sports director Horst Heldt suggested that, although a seasonal goal was achieved, the other is still in the distance.
We're not above the mountain yet.
The fact that the hero wasn't celebrating after three months on his 40th birthday, even after the first triumph, was at the events of the weekend, which lived freshly in the form of a television interview that was broadcast immediately before the start of the game by Torhür Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that make others and not the Jens, contended hero the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown leadership weakness to the board and decided to switch to puberty fans' pressure.
Lehmann also appreciated his free day after playing, as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disgustingness.
Lehmann's statements were "affected by pure egoism", hero backed and announced consequences for the final man.
You're probably not gonna be friends for life anymore, the two fifty-year-olds.
However, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work through the dissolved trainer team, the playful and fighterly strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share of success," said hero and Lehmann unisono - and the man also agreed with the plastic suite.
WM fight in heavy weight
Hitzige Duell in Bern: Always again provoked exhibitors Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavy weight title according to WBC version.
The judgment of the judges fell unanimously.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains Box World Championship in heavy weight.
The 38-year-old champion, according to the WBC's version, conquered the US-American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainian had already been two World Championships of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't work with the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he had to be hit due to injuries.
The Chairman Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th Battle.
For about 17,000 spectators in the Berner Arena, the 2.02 meters large Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left hand of leadership.
The eleven centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the Duell, repeatedly withdrawn the battles of the World Championship, so that Klitschko could not decisively achieve his dangerous rights.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a prosecutor and tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his slaughter hit the world champion rarely.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The explorer had taken care of some wrestles before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as "heartly zombie", which "nothing can't be right."
On Friday, the champion was then provoked to push Johnson the sunglasses from the nose, "to see his eyes."
Fourth Victory for Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth struggle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of expiry, he had struck the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his "sin" WBC belt, which he had to give up without fighting.
This year he then forced Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
In this fight I just got a hit and is physically very good in shape, Klitschko had justified the fast return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is World Champion of the Associations WBO and IBF.
The belt of the WBA, however, wears the British David Haye, after he was able to throne the 2.13 meters of Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
Its promotion company claims to already plan the fight against Klitschko in the Wembley Stadium of London.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group Head Jürgen Trittin called Defense Minister Guttenberg for false information about the customer business as a liar.
SPD and left require information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings on the air attack of Kunduz, the opposition Minister for Defense Karl-Theodor in Guttenberg (CSU) has been subjected to a conscious deception.
The Minister said to the deadly bombardement on two tank load trains from September "scientificly the intrusion," said Green Group chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news release "Tagesschau".
It is called landscape: he has lied.
The order to kill has been granted under the laws of the International Security Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that the NATO had read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only about destruction of the kidnapped loader but also about killing two Taliban leaders targetedly.
The US air attack requested by the German Kunduz Commander, Colonel Klein, had been killed or injured by up to 142 people, according to the Nato investigation report.
Green, SPD and Left asked Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Canzleramt, Federal War and News Service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green Collegin Renate Künast requested.
President Ulrich Wilhelm decisively rejected the criticism.
He said that the Office of Chancellors did not influence concrete efforts of the Federal Army in Afghanistan.
On Saturday, there had also been doubts about the presentation of the Ministry on the background of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have informed correctly and fully about the backgrounds of the tank loader attack.
Officially it had said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and kept sensitive details to the Minister.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, they claimed that they had even referred to the Ministry of Defence to several reports, including a two-sided document of the commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunger report.
Wichert has now asked in a letter to clarify the case, reports the "Frankfurter General Sundayszeitung".
He hasn't received an answer until now, says it.
On Saturday, the Ministry did not refer to the proposals and pointed out that this was clarified in the Committee on Research of the Federal Day, which intends to concentrate on Wednesday.
Traum Worlds
Some see pictures and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in psychiatric illness and in the drug rush, the limits between imagination and reality swim.
As long as it happens in sleep, it's all right.
If we are lying in our dark rooms with closed eyes, we can give ourselves the wildest ideas and fantasy images.
However, whoever experiences traumatic conditions in the wake, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world is usually considered to be crazy or drug - susceptible, at least as a special.
However, such pictures and voices do not only occur in psychiatric illness or in drug distress.
blame has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, sometimes ensure that the boundaries between dreams, madness and reality disappear.
Traumaly modified wake-consciousness conditions may occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of mad.
Although the triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystery Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophecy Carlos Castaneda, Shamanic withdrawal conditions, psychoses and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or insane representations arise when the balance of the neuronal bots of the brain - all in front of dopamine, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholin - is disrupted and the interaction of various brain parts is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
The gravity has no power over him anymore
The connection of madness and dream has been involved by philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristoteles regarded hallucinations as a form of dream in awake condition, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, in 1861 a "great similarity of irritability with dream conditions", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all uncertainties, irritations, sensual disappointments of such one".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and silent.
The gravity has no power over him anymore, he swifts at the room cover.
He feels a step.
Behind him fed devil shapes with blood red, distorted fractures, teeth fledging.
They hunt him, step him with heavy, flaming stitches, throw him against the walls, he feels the pains on the whole body.
Sounds, malicious voices drone from walls and radios.
He can't endure them anymore, the voices that insult him and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo plant, knocks them into a snare and puts them on a hook on the deck.
He rises to a speaker and lays the snare around his neck.
Jump.
The snare is going to be loose.
This should be a lesson to you, the voices shout in a trumpet-fetching choir, "go to the clinic and let you heal!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychos, the last two years, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoide psychosis, also he is manic-depressive, he takes medicines, against depression, the manie, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his disease, he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The Trug Pictures are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in life, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most frequent disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, subjects are usually no longer able to distinguish between internal and external worlds, in an excessive state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
The voice hearing is particularly widespread - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The affected person can no longer separate from unimportant, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is overflowed by impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis also opens the loops for a flood of ideas and fantasy that originate with deeper consciousness layers.
The realization of the psychosis is subjectively centred, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the general psychiatry clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrene is located in the centre of the event, everything has a meaning to it.
At the same time, he is put into a passive role, he is, like in the dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Thus, schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality balance is usually not possible for them, the cargo images are cruel reality, waking out.
Once in life a hallucination experienced
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but remains the sensible and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis in principle."
The weird thoughts and hallucinations are found in the reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain strikes Capriolen, researchers are still presenting mystery.
Exceptional conditions may lead to a short-term loss of reality, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic reaction to schizophrenia, but twining studies have shown that the genes are not the only factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimum brain damage in the affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at a early stage of development, for example by a virus disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But there remains a mystery as the disturbance of the neuronal system occurs, which, at first, does not manifest itself over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis if the disposition is available.
Halluzinogene drugs can also cause psychoses as they intervene in the transmitter system.
When our brain runs hot
The crazy is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medicines to get rid of them, others spend money for drugs to get what, says Lübecker Psychology professor Erich Box.
Whether Trug images are felt pleasant or unpleasant, it is often only a question of the position.
Box has been collecting reports about hallucinations and traitors for ten years, last year he has evaluated his results in the book "The irreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying manifestations of psychoses, but also of amazing many other diseases.
In addition to psychiatric disorders such as borderline or depression, they often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or alzheimer and skull brain traumata.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, such as boxes, are composed of memory contents that are usually retained.
They arise when Harnaeale, in which sensual sensation is processed, is overactive or too low, if our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can cause this condition as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But as well as riding, stress, love cums or other mental exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to one third of the respondents indicated that they had experienced hallucination at least once in life.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and visiting the gymnasium there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there weren't the pictures and voices.
In the break, it may happen that a slack boy with long, dark hairs speaks to it.
When it answers, the schoolmates look at it surprised - nobody else sees or hears this boy.
They think that shy girl is a spooked day dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears the girl in the bank next to herself.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
Is I crazy?, she asks herself sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other cargo images aren't real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are mostly annoying
Often, the cargo images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material because the teacher in her eyes and ears just presents a new student, while he explains mathematical equations to all others and is visible on the table.
At night, the appearances are mostly anxious.
If she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which is much too rare and too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or dreaming whether the pictures she sees, the fractures or the girl with the bloody cutting wounds of arms and legs, arise before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams the shapes.
Parents and friends don't tell her that they would think they'd be crazy.
Herb 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She last year endured the Abitur and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations have stopped.
Since she has contacted the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also an artwork of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers under riding, he is probable for a while after hallucinations, says Box.
I suppose the brain is then underbushed and is self-interviewing.
Sarah K., a single child, was scared of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she calls Papa since she can think is not her physical father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas, which also process real impressions and noises, it is difficult for the affected people like Sarah K. to distinguish trait images and reality. "Every experience," says box, "besides in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also pictures that make the brain create, so they work so real."
Nighty dream pictures also become box as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, psychiatrists are able to recognize their cargo images as irreal.
Box therefore advises his patients to also evaluate hallucinations as a special ability.
Limitary condition between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our very conscious world, imaginary experience is mostly pathologistized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief Physician of the Hospital for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, suffering disease, but it also contains positive, creative - wahn is also an artwork of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroide experience, a special form of traumatically altered wake-consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed Quasi dreams that the survivor thinks real and which he can not distinguish afterwards from the wake state.
The unioid consciousness condition occurs in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, such as polyradiculitis patients who experience a motoric lamb when fully conscious.
When a person is threatened with self-defeat and world loss, for example by persistent, total inability of movement, he replaces the life-threatening real situation by a own, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of frontier state between dream and hallucination.
Since the management of a situation in reality is not possible, a world change is taking place, but the real situation is conceived in the imagination.
An intense form of sense-making and sense-making in an intolerant situation that allows humans to not be in any loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zürcher Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a cardiovascular surgery with subsequent heart transplants goes on to travel for days, while his body is sentenced to unmovable movement at the intensive station.
Claussen pops into a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bed-feeling, old man, on board of a train-sanatorium, a robot watching his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among ants who produce noises from blood.
A Greek on the motorcycle in its homeland is swallowed, surfing with his spy bed in the Florence of the Alps and encountering a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner trips vary fundamentally from every dream for Claussen.
Dream is another condition, he describes his experience.
On the other hand, the memories of mental journeys are still overwhelming to me after years and in other details.
Clearer and more intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience explodes the horizon of our other living experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, Oneiroides, Psychosen, Hallucinations and Drugs show how breachy our inner images of external reality are also in the watch.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist Box summarizes, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow breaking can come
Burda
Children should take the 27-year-old publishing
The new publisher Callen is an intermediate solution: Hubert Burda wants to give his business in the hands of his two children, he said to the SPIEGEL.
The holding is also supposed to be 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children are inherited at 27 years and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
The details of this have been carefully regulated.
The question of whether they are active in the company is only after that.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to provide 7500 employees with their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company too.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he was withdrawing from the presidency board from January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old calf has been head of Burda since 1999.
First he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury area, the responsibility for the company's capabilities and after the elimination of Jürgen Todenhöfer was also the responsibility for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the publishing.
Burdas children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of callen also serves to overcome "10, 15 years", said Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, said Burda.
In view of the cases of destiny and Schaeffler, Burda said that also family companies are not sure before the deceased: "This always concerns families who were infected by a capital seeking who had been completely inspected and thought they could rise up to a very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "never dreams of world power," said Burda.
I do not see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play in the World League with 'Time', these shops have grown too large.
Perfect Beauty
All you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available.
This is at least what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), where everything is just about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you can find among others viewed companies such as Hedonai, who provide a hairhair with laser; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the frisher Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
However, there is also a food department that highlights through their tea house with more than 130 different tea types.
A relaxing massage together with your partner to be enjoyed and also have a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relax area for two hours to put your own "beauty party" on your legs with eight friends and then relax in the Whirlpool or with a massages and a glass champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided for the latest face and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy to 12 rooms.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The fitness studio also has this kind of devices, and there are also virtual trainers who care for the customer's training units and thus provide them with a perfect personal training.
One starts a training unit with the input of a personal password on a touchscreen that is located against the devices.
Then you will show different videos how to perform your training units correctly.
The leader of the fitness studio assures that 15 minutes (including heating and dishes) are perfectly sufficient to train the body muscles.
And then, after you have trained her body, you still want to watch by the hairstyle salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments are offered to recover the hair, glossy and health for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusiveity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 to 22 p.m. in the evening 365 days of the year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas gets always closer and so it's a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and get their fast clothes into our clothing cabinet.
The form of the decolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the points that need to be considered.
Here are some proposals.
The singer Fergie has chosen an excessive and very complicated decolleté. It is only possible to advise.
Endsa and Barcelona with the electric car
The power company Endsa, together with the city of Barcelona, created the "LIVE Bureau".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the road map for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make arrangements for mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is designed to promote the electric car and its opinions and measures.
This is an attempt to drive forward the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
Barcelona, however, is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla also participate in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to speed up the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endsa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include such activities that are related to energy and, in particular, to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative in which endsa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of rest" for the automobile sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied the Spanish automotive industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "a horizon of rest".
In the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero again recalled the measures which the government launched to support the automotive sector during the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would today have a panoramic of neglecting and suspending some of our main production works," explained the President-in-Office.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the automotive manufacturers to produce in a highly competitive industry in Spain, we can see a quiet horizon for the contribution of this industry, which is our biggest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the plan for competitiveness, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided 800 million euros for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which, in turn, provided investments of more than 3 billion euros.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also stressed the government's actions to boost demand, in line with the 2000E plan, which is applicable in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and automotive manufacturers.
According to the Head of Government , this plan allows the average reduction of exhaust gases in the new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6 %, resulting in a "great increase" in the authorisations which increased "by 40%" in November.
To 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid the first issue of the International Classic Automobile Messe is organized, an exhibition for experts and lovers of the world of engines.
This fair will take place in the Pabellón de Cristal of Casa de Campo in Madrid from 5 to 7 February 2010.
In this context, 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands on an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters.
Not only classic motorcycles and vehicles can be stunned, but you will also find all possible items related to the world of engines at the ClassicAuto Madrid.
This is how you can find accessories, spare parts, components, materials accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc. for the exhibitors.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classic engines, which will be enthusiastic to the collectors and lovers.
Among the companies who will participate in this fair, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times are vehicle sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars specialized in Mercedes Benz.
Elevation tests in the area
In addition, the sales activities on this fair are complemented by parallel events: meetings, sports vehicles exhibitions, skill tests, events and competitions.
There are also technical tests with classic cars and motorcycles on a specially furnished race line in the Auβ area of the measuring area.
Mazda3 i-stop: environmentally sustainable sports
Mazda wants to prove that sport is consistent with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the motor's automatic stop and drive system, baptized to the name i-stop, a device, which is currently only available for the 2.0 fuel engine with 150 PS.
This second generation of Mazdas 3 is produced by its good notes in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, comfort, its Straßenbehavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front seats, you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good stop.
The game of the steering is also excellent.
When you further consider the unit made from the instrument table and the armatur board, you can find that Mazda has a variety of buttons and switches in the visible colors of red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend to a futuristic inner design.
This style partly reminds us of the style of Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can be said that both Mazda 3, as well as Civic, both Japanese models, decrease from the fertility of the German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to cross.
The passenger room of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort so that four adults can drive with the car too comfortable.
All of this comes a large-scale and clear-shaped baggage room.
The stop and drive system is only available for the 2-liter gasoline engine with 150 PS and a 6-way switch.
This engine is a real enjoyment. It is produced by his fineness, by his silent noise, his performances and by its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in corridor switching and its low consumption, even if in Mazda, especially the diesel models that are mostly sold.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the sampling is a speciality, since it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
From the serial repository, the assistant for driving trail switching (RVM) is mainly the one that disables the dead angle, but also the control elements for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive internal mirror, the board computer with a large-scale screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio-bluetooth, as well as the chromed 17-inch surfaces.
In addition, this version also includes, as if it was not enough for equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for additional 1,500 euros: Besides other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon lenses and the sound system BOSE with CD load.
Fazit
The Mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one of the best compact cars of his class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the diversity of equipment.
Moreover, those who do not lie down many kilometres a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 fuel engine with 150 PS.
The only negative to this model is a bit high price, which is between 21.770 euros for the luxury model and 23.270 euros for the sampled model Sportive.
However, as a reward at this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day to the new highest pass.
A premier with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red tape of sensibility for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars, dressed in models that looked as elegant as sexy, more than ever.(Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, decided for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is too limited, a device with which you can only read your emails without a possibility of seeing some attachments or browsing through the Internet.
It enjoyed his five minutes of fame when it chose the Time magazine to one of the products of the year.
Looking at the Straβe is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is, however, of particular interest for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flatrate, for example only half of the price of the flatrate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success, the company brought two new devices on the market: one that is intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, contrary to Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but it has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes Roaming for all Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone around the world already know what it means to quit all the data to read their emails as soon as you have crossed the country border or if you desperately seek a café with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of the roaming with flatrate is incredibly tricky and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stays, but my experience is that you already need a doctoral title in physics and a good glass to read all the small printed.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission in terms of affordable roaming tariffs for all Europe remained almost unrespectful.
Besides your own country, you are always afraid of reading your emails and that rightly.
That a small device like FonPeek (which it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it does not have any Wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs, means that the telephone providers need to reconsider and start considering various ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example for this, in its prices the download of books and further requests are included on the Internet.
Without vetrag and without hacks.
This is an Internet-enabled device and one is paying for it only once, namely when buying, and not monthly for month.
And that's exactly what I also expect from FonPeek one day, a buying option with lifelong Internet access as the Peek already offers in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
Especially I expect this because I believe it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already at the office of Barack Obama as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a mantle of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him with his, without any doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the peace nobel price in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has worn very similar models at both occasions: auβer that it was almost the same color - a brilliant green yellow -, the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and jacket from the same fabric-- and thereby it was a little largely sticked or a necklace.
It is even so that at the first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different in the type of substance they are made from.
At the introduction of the office, she wore a dress of top and in Oslo of a seed modeled.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-high paragraphs and for the second time a uniform model, but gold colors.
The hair was also different every time: the hair was stuck up at this occasion as a hair crown, when she had the hair open at the previous time.
75% of the employed mothers have suffered problems in work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially in the younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute of Women "Fruchtability and Career of Women in Spain".
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years of age makes no doubt: 75% of the employed women see their career opportunities on the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are great differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if yes, what kind of profession they are exercising.
Those of them who do not perform other activities outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed work contract will rather be mothers and have more children.
Contrary to this, women with a firm job, especially in the public field, have a family and maternity, and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a fixed job get their first child by average only 3.7 years after the gathering, a number which increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment, which have taken longer to achieve this and which have taken her together and the first child has only achieved much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a major influence on motherhood, although less than the calendar on reception willingness," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account when women are aged in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in the same age of women.
For example, women in the group were between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only the primary school graduation or higher education, averaged by 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time mother.
Furthermore, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While women with main closure already marry before their first festival and get their first child, the women with a medium or high school finish are quite different and find a festival and then get their first child, Delgado determines.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name: Diane Kruger.
From the coming year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the general advertisement talk "Because you are worth it".
The chief writer from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at international level, will become another famous trailer as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
In front of her were the last ones who were allowed to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
With the men, the cosmetic company also has only exceptional messages: Patrick Dempsey ("grey ́s anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Schauspielkolleg von Evangeline in "Lost").
The price of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today, met at the annual price rental held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
To that end, they had all appeared.
The ex model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, which was chosen for the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, pictures of Fernando Vicente) to the threeβ X-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
It does not use a predictable and fearful genre (current biography, life and work), but seeks an ease for the glowing heart of the Creator.
The trip is exciting and Vicent does not spare fears or reliefs.
Besides that this book is a delicious reading, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again.
Here are some sections from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual, almost senseful tribulation, just as I always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unhealthy fate, the moral without guilt and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allgoric Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between independence and ignorance, with a profound poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife ring that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was united by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years in her ban, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in coming to heaven on the way of destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was released in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 summits in world literature, you have to climb up on the north wall, on the wall, on which the best mountain climbs try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a funny couch.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the inheritance of a good owner of the county and once again he said he was the son of a black and a krocodile.
Both dreams proved to be a certain green Bé."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the crazy cry that was screamed from a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo could go down to the night of the 20th century in his literary way. This was what he did during a journey on which he fled before himself and with a speech full of violence in front of the worms invited the desert.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneels down and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses are digged by Spencer: ' sleep after the effort,/ after the thrust of the port,/ rest after the war,/ after a satisfaction of life, you will find pleasure in the death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her bag, she always had her depressions.
The husband took it with absolute normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spying them out between the Azales or singing the birds in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patience and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was much bigger than her crazyness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do to try to flew Joyce into Baroja?
What, then, did Benet mean if he didn't bring Baroja to Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Feig Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked last week through our part of town in Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people lived next to her 15-18 years and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we had taken from the animal home and which just weighs six pounds, and then they missed him two footsteps from warmer heavens and hurt him.
Our dissolution cannot be understood, as it is incomprehensible for us, where the suit should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on the line.
There is also the disease attack that a woman, who walked cozyly, got when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, for if such a crazy man attacks a dog, he may also make it the same with a woman, a child, an elder man, or probably even with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The event occurred in a normally quiet district at five o'clock afternoon on a very usual Tuesday.
The dog's been wearing all day.
Of course, we have made an advertisement in a nearby police office, but we have great doubts whether this is going to bring about anything and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we only want to clarify that the vicious criminals were Spanish.
Our dissolution about the event has caused us to show this incident.
We cannot understand what has to do in the heads of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on a animal that gives us love, company, and friendship.
We don't know where the good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for use of helmet
In cooperation with the Spanish Transport Safety Foundation (Fesvial) the tyre manufacturer Michelin launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially in the younger motorcycle drivers, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to highlight the importance of helmet use, as it is finally the only protection element that can prevent head injury or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to transport safety, which "thereby includes more than just the design and manufacture of products that become more and more safe with every day" and further confirmed that they also contribute with other actions of educational and informative character to reaching this goal a step closer to each day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle running under the slogan 'To be or not to be' will be distributed at over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
To conclude, Michelin stressed that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and just because it is always obliged as a manufacturer of tyres for two-three vehicles to be one of its main goals to develop ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks rises again
After nearly two years, the car market for small transporters finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles approved in Spain in November mean an increase of 12.6% in reference to 2008, and, much more importantly, they are the first growth in all after 22 consecutive months with steady decline, according to the numbers presented by the manufacturers' association Anfac and the Ganvam car traders.
However, these good figures are currently only very cautious, since the reference data used for comparison from November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a decrease of 60 % in the previous year.
However, it must be noted that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total allowances of these 11 months remained 40% below the sales numbers of the previous financial year.
A total of 95.853 vehicles have been sold since January, but in this number all vehicles consisting of the small transport market include: discharges of passenger cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and lighter trucks/carriage units.
In addition, the same thunder clouds in the sky are still the same, which are most likely to take the demand, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by individuals, the majority of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
In this way, further factors, such as the increase in unemployment rate or the continuation of the bad economic situation, must be included in these restrictions, which are the result of the currencies of the credit institutions.
In this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, financial support has helped little in buying a vehicle of the plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only intended for individuals, but also for self-employed and small businesses is entitled to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 excess which cannot exceed 160 grams per driven kilometre, but the low sales numbers speak for themselves.
Already yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it was essential for the state to draw special attention to these small loads as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (loader cars and car buses).
The car dealer association prophesied for 2010 a similar year as the past, for which it accounts for a 19% sales loss (for passenger cars and land cars).
Support for brake manoeuvres in critical situations is now required
As with the ABS anti-blocker brake system and as it is now happening with the ESP stability control, help systems must become a mandatory equipment in European cars for braking in emergency cases.
In fact, they are already obliged for all newly approved passenger cars and small transporters, for the remaining vehicles a carance period has been established by the end of February 2011.
The action adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of the Fuβ gangers, but these brake systems can also help to prevent many accidents in the event of their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exercise more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake manipulation, which recognises the system based on the brake strength performed by the driver on the brake pedal.
However, this system does not practice this pressure until the end.
According to a study commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even come to the brake pedal before the collapse, and half of them had not broke out with force.
Up to 1.100 accidents
On the other hand, the braking aid interferes with maximum power into the brake system and thus reduces the brake time and thus also the brake distance that a car leaves in the brake operation.
According to a EU study, up to 1.100 fatal accidents in which fuβgagers are harmful could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistants.
There would even be fewer accidents - it is estimated that every fourth accident could be prevented with personal damage - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency brake systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that (with radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time it exercises a light pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him to increase pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collapse is inevitable, the brake assistant exercises the maximum pressure on the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel until January
While the company of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new Chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first April week, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer indicates that he needs more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Mr Reilly, the new Chairman of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the page concerned already gives its approval to each point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will first be presented to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
In fact, GM is assured that in the next days a decision will be made on the sale of Saab.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American autobuilder to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to contact some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which has back coverage from the Russian group, is increasingly acquiring.
If none of these purchasers had to reach an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to suspend Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to maintain.
On the control of Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewels, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really made it easier to make it around 80 kilos, bringing it only 1,275 pounds on the scale now.
In order to create such a thing, they for the first time left the automatic foldable roof, which was replaced by a tent line wall roof with a manual drive, so that one alone had spared 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model such as the GT3 "disappear" further 15; by removing the air conditioning again 13; by reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, further 7 kilos were retained; by the installation of sporting Bacquet seats again 12 and again with the light 19-cell fields again.
Then, by the absence of the CDR-30 audio system, there was another six kilos less and the missing kilo was reached by the exchange of the door grips by means of handles from fabric.
Although he is also available with the double coupling driven PDK, the sampling was carried out with a vehicle with 6-current hand drives, mainly on the smaller country streets of California, on mountain routes that really lived very curious.
In his driving behaviour, only the note can be given to him in vain.
However, the reduction of his weight has not meant that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite of the case: we haven't been trying a small and light model for a long time, but at the same time we also have a feeling of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low walk in the necessary time until we give him the orders to run, brake, recover, and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He's doing everything he's told. The car makes everything we put on him with our hands on the steering, thanks to his steering, which is as communicative as precise.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all flavors
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 PS (10 more than the boxer S) has been successful and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the motor noise, which has already been used for the first time in the panamera.
The acceleration power is unimaginably brutal, whether out of standing or again accelerating.
The feathers are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the landstraβ, on which we went with the Boxster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and that, although we found in some of these curves ice in the morning grey and roll split in the morning.
In summary, you can say that it's a ultra light car, a car with which you have an incomprehensible driving pass, as it's probably rather rare and in it's much more than just a small improvement of the boxster Ss.
The car will be marketed in February 2010 and costs 70,831 EUR.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Cosmetic Line Coco Cocoon and an opportunity starlet at the fashion views of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same throat as her bags of Chanel.
A lot more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the Dusko Ivanovic team, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 in his visit to the complicated Fuβ ball field of Maccabi Electra and thus comes on the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, which was with eight three times the best of his team (29 at the evaluation).
The team from Vitoria could replace the significant outcomes of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of use and team work, even if they were waiting for their victory until the bitter end.
The great matches from the perimeter with 16 rated three times contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the blue reds, who set themselves from the beginning to the top on the ads table.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria came out of the perimeter, it was already possible to remember that they had come to the field with well-heated handles.
They were English and Teletovic, mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava decided for a internal game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received when he returned to the team with peppers and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to highlight himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter had already been remembering that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the significant advantage of the break, the game was not yet decided for a long time, and the Makkabians wanted to remind the Vitorians again that not everyone wins on their field of game, and thanks to the repeated attacking "Hand of Elias" they came back to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the turning of the wheel (50-49).
More disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but all other than dead, had to prepare a few toys with meeting security to get air again, and with one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, which with three almost each three times and with the support of English and Ribas, ensured that the advertisement table again showed a reassuring distance of (54-67) which the host was able to splendle at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaveses were blloβ in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had earned in the first three-third minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, not the best of their team, and tried to give their team back through three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was put out of place because of Fouls, the team of Ivanovic did not give up, defended himself well and although the Israelis had picked up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already lost a winner and Tel Aviv for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being invited to the forehead
Unicaja lost a loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to take the lead in the Euroliga Group B, and this in a game that was characterized by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the interior game, which facilitated the Greek victory.
The malaga team was neither afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship nor of the opposing team, which may be one of the strongest Europeans and have a lot of money.
Thanks to the game offered in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three successive threefold, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the host blended with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the erein Unicaja, even though the local team with an interior game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, it made it possible that the advertisement table in the 13th minute 22-20 indicated its favor, the minute in which it had almost come to battle between the two Americans Beverley and Williams because of an action.
The Greek team finally began to get warm and his superiority on both sides of the game, while the exclusion of the English Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez left clear traces at Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian predecessor Linas Kleizas, with its three times, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A retirement hunting was impossible
The third quarter of the game was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite his 19 losses, proved superior and even resulted in compensating the difference in the game in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn led the leadership within the group.
Unicaja tried to get away from the many accidents and the exclusion of the shot Robert Archibald who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the Federation and the threefold of Cook and the use of Lewis came again a little hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was impossible, as the Olympiacos was not to brake, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area.
In the 37th minute, the Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic made it possible to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to be hit and the leadership of Olympiacos had to run away.
How much should you deserve in Facebook due to your profile?
Facebook users can now, thanks to the new application of Trovit, the search engine with most advertisements of real estate, jobs and cars in Spain, experience their salary that they should earn due to their profile.
The tool "How much should you deserve?" calculates the salaries of users using more than 140,000 jobs available at Trovit in Spain. Users are available in Facebook to enter their profession, professional experience, age and city where they work.
Already after a week, after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish employee feels "slechtly paid," explains Albert Ribera, responsible for the product, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in Great Britain and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross rate of 45.226 euros and a French 31.059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros that earn a Spanish.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net content of 34.247 euros in England, 25.751 in France and 16.420 euro in Spain.
According to Trovit, the most poorly paid work in Spain is one cellner with 11.592 euro net annually; followed by the work of a seller with 14.725 euros and a worker with 15.667 euros.
The most visited sites on the Internet in the last three months are a driver, semiday offices and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in its message in Tegucigalpa.
The President withdrawn from the Office must leave diplomatic representation at the latest on January 27, 2010 when his mandate expires officially
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed the television broadcaster TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must have left the message in which he had found asylum since 21 September.
"He is aware that he has to go on January 27, as his mandate runs this day and he needs to find a new accommodation."
The sender also quoted the ex-president who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the back coverage of the government of Brazil," said Zelaya on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (when Porfirio Lobo proved to be a victory) Zelaya assured that he would stay in the Brazilian message until January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed to refuse Zelayas to recognise the status of an asylum seeking politician who wanted to force the "de facto" government under the presidency of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the most enthusiastic days since last spring, when the inflation of assets was the dominant mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no case surprising, since this is their natural condition, in an environment where the makers make decisions on a naturally unsafe future.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to compensate the debts with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to allow the liquidity free hand at interest which is moving around zero, so that the banks can buy assets to calculate them.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are as close as finished and, without questioning their heterodox policy on liquidity, start to screw some sand into the drive, as the BCE näc had already done with their annual increase that took place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the world economy to maintain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are just going to be witnesses of reverse in reducing risk premiums.
The refugees of stock exchanges and the differences in business bonuses are rising again, even if they are far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to govern private risks and the government debts are rising again.
The quality is now set back and the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the euro area in terms of Germany.
Until now, Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision down with regard to Spain's evaluation.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not harm the defendants of the moral risk, who had again tried to create a consciousness for what they had caused, since they had refrained from the devastating effects of the limitation of loans to loss of jobs when they had actually decided a new day to thank them.
Nonetheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribe war between the emires to restore the power in the emires and the development in Greece was also foreseen earlier.
A government that swears the state debt, elections and a new government that draws the same strike.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It doesn't make any sense that Ecofin Hungary saves from non-compliance with their foreign payments early in the year and thus permits a Member State of the euro to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account the obligation to maintain the stability of the government funds when it is necessary to take out the habitual measures.
Yes, we are as expected before a episode of normalization of the risk premiums, after some drops on too high amounts, this would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in state debt increase at the same speed as the European business bonuses.
However, if European differences were reduced and the Spanish would continue to increase, it would be a special Spanish risk.
That of Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the present indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recreation and correct their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which, therefore, come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, do not promise all of this in spite of warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "suite on driving" is given.
Connected branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, appeared yesterday before Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply will be debated in the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the Chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán the press gave some points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest 50 billion euros and more 60 billion euros from that date until 2030, subject to the precondition that the current nuclear power plants continue to operate.
If this was not the case, the necessary investments would not be up to 60 billion but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it is no longer necessary to invest in an increase in energy production capacity but in distributor networks and international associations.
From 2020, the questionnaire will change and performance should be increased.
Its proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with equipment to capture carbon dioxide and, of course, mainly on renewable energy.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW is needed more, under prerequisite naturally by other "support energy".
Galán, who believes that the draft statute for a sustainable economy, which was just adopted by the government, is in a line with what its company demanded, did not in any case want to say something against this law to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his view, "the long term is clearly set on this direction, despite some" individuals" measures, as it referred to by the Chairman of Iberdrola.
If it is like it, Galán believes that decisions on investments should be made already now, even if they are long-term, since it will need some time and a stable compensation framework must be created to attack them.
Ferrovial gets the "action" from Aer Lingus to ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, the Swiss port, is the preferred partner of the Irish Flugesellschaft Aer Lingus for baggage service at ten European airports on which they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet been announced, has been set up for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castilia-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a protocol on cooperation in order to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The Alliance plans investments from 20 million to 2012, from which 50% of Ferrovial will originate.
One of the responsibilities of the Centre will be the examination of energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with high depth and Bouygues for its first car construction in Australia
Acciona fights for the approval of its first carway in Australia, a market on which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction it is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately EUR 1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German high depth are its competitors.
A 5 kilometres long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city administration wishes to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration of public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) has decided to advance the project according to a business plan set up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for the construction and administration of the coins.
As expected in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), competing three consorties, in particular European construction companies.
The group called Transcity is referred to by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second with a seat in Italy, one of the best specialists for deep construction.
Against the Acciona team, the Consortium Northern Direct is established by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, responsible for the infrastructure and the French Bouygues construction group.
The third and last consortium, which is in the closer election, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (the subsidiary of the German construction company, which belongs to the ACP), also the local Baulderstone (in possession of the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and the French company Razel, specializing in the public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises enormous construction and privatisation, but it is necessary to overcome a barrier because only the purchase of a local construction company has access to it.
A strategy followed by the above-mentioned firms high depth or bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has to be pursued by the Spanish builders.
Even ACP has gained access to this market only through its participation of 30% in the high depth, the owner of the Leighton mentioned.
Millions of assets
Acciona is of the highest importance in this geographical area for the industry in which it is already known as a energy supplier and in the decommissioning industry because of its activity.
Under other assets, it already has its large windmill park in Victoria (192 MW) and leads to the group of companies who have been assigned to build and manage Adelaide's decommissioning plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground moonline, which is promoted by the Office for Infrastructure of the city of Brisbane and the Northern Link (Nordzubringer) has the purpose to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the surrounding strate in Kelvin Grove(see map) on a length of 5 kilometres through tunnel. This is the major measure for steurdown on the Straßen von Brisbane.
The driving plan issued by the city administration provides the delivery for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this wallpaper is already to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is assumed that the construction work will last until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two tracks in every direction, an electronic wall system and a complex lighting system.
The Government of Queensland participates in financing with $500 million of Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For high depth, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia forgives significant orders to high depth, which signed a contract with the government last night of 154 million.
The ACP sub company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with glass fibre cable through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create a fast Internet access for 400,000 people and will employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the King George Tower's construction project with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The constructions have not yet started and have received 129 million high depth for it.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
The initial investments amount to EUR 75 million.
FCC receives the order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has provided its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometres long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had received the allowance for construction to expand the Tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way Alpine increases his experience in tunnel construction.
The start of the construction work is planned for early 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the Sra Agency. Rushmore has a total of about three million euros annually, the railway company announced.
This Treaty also provides the possibility of two extensions of each 12 months. Sra. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies who presented s to this competition that Renfe wrote out, 4 of whom came to the final round, among them TBWA, which was responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be commissioned with the design and production of campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom due to the outbrems of competition.
France Télécom has punished more than 63 million euros for anticompetitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programmes for consumers at the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state companies have collected more than 560 million euros of penalties since 1994 because of the disability of its competitors.
The penalty incurred yesterday was even increased, as the authority who guards competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and has therefore become relapsed.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application page on the Internet to increase revenue from businesses that do not belong to the telephone connection.
This appeal website of Orange is essentially active in France and the United Kingdom.
You must wait until 2010 until this site will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought Madrid and Barça up 476.4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has seen its origin in 1992 as a source of revenue for the Fuβ ball club.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476,4 million since that time, bringing them the third and fifth place of the Fuβ ball clubs that have earned most money in the League.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The winning of the Champions League of the UEFA brings not only fame with itself. It is also one of the main sources of intake of the great associations.
According to the UEFA, the League has distributed up to EUR 5.362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) who have participated in this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is on the third place of Europe, who earned most money through its participation and who is the only one next to AC Milan who has won the trophy three times.
The official Catalan master and last winner of the former Europecup in 1992 is the fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who also took the most money through their participation in the past Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost against Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries that could earn money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all other (five, unlike four bee Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complex method of granting the UEFA.
During this financial year, the organisation, whose presidency has Michel Platini, calculates the revenue of 1.090 million by the Champions League.
The UEFA 443.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 Fuβ ball clubs who participated in the qualifications premises (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.2 million.
In addition, those who struggled with participation received 3.8 million by their blues presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for profits (80,000 euros) and for a distinguishing (40,000 per team). The clubs that have arrived at the eight-finale are given three million each; the four who have come into the quarterly final, 3.3 million.
The last four will receive 4 million each.
The winner deserves 9 million, unlike the second that receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a Fuβ ball club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31,2 million of fixed revenues.
Barça again earned 2.5 million in August with his victory at the European Supercup.
However, there are still variable payments for which 337,8 million are intended.
This money will be distributed proportionally to the value of each single television market.
The Spanish belongs to the first and has 4 places allocated.
The Master of the last year receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play in this year's issue.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% participation in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group has last released details about the purchase of shares by which it wants to acquire a ceiling between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage which does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In the Concrete, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share payable for ten years with an annual interest rate of 1 % due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Soss shares closed by EUR 1.85, so Nueva Rumasa assesses the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real evaluation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The group from Jeréz gives the shareholders a 15-day period to communicate their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV assured that this offer had not been informed, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had been in contact with the Authority.
At the end, the deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In the attempt to remain at the edge of possible purchases and the court Querels of his ex-Manager, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as director of the internal audit.
A decision by which she becomes the first woman who has a high position in the food company.
It is a newly created post, which is directly subject to the chairman of the Group.
This is all other than free from Polemik, because the company is involved in a judicial battle because of the suspect of redirecting more than 230 million sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be excluded that Soss moves further capital over the next months.
In view of Salazar's loan, Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (Representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared yesterday before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the move of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion invitation submitted by the Investment Company Mer by Paternina
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public invitation to tender submitted by the Investment Company Mer for Federico Paternina last October.
The supervisory authority explained that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been proven that the conditions comply with the legally effective laws and, therefore, the content of the submission, after the amendments of the last December 2nd, can be considered "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer aims at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7,65 euros per share, which, in turn, is 8.95% of the company capital, composed of 6.142.786 euros in shares approved at Madrid and Bilbao stocks.
Furthermore, it has been announced that 5.592.778 million shares have been established, which cannot be transferred in any way until the invitation to tender has been completed and the price of Federico Paternina has been fixed in accordance with the laws of law.
New programmes for the examination of vehicles
In these days of accidents and accidents, not only the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day thousands of vehicles engaged in an accident are transferred to the workshops where an advisor has to assess the damage caused and the costs for repair.
No accident is equal and the calculation of the costs for parts and hours of work can be a long-term and complex task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, may take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest informatics tools, it is a question of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of the advisors use this type of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process them afterwards and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera group, is the market leader; 80% of all opinions are created with their products.
The two other companies competing with the tool market for reviewing and drawing up a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is everything other than simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, a sales leader of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are cooperating, providing each of them the information in a different format.
Moreover, the amount of data to be edited will be increasingly larger, up to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engineering came to the market than in all the fifteen years before.
Once a new car comes to the market, the company starts working.
It is a tired task, because each of the but thousand parts of vehicles must be catagolized and their price entered.
In addition, each model creates a "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" various parts of the vehicle.
If it is a very sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure is promptly proceeding.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently Audatex has 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain with complete information.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle park on the Straβs, it is more than 99 %.
For the implementation of documentation and the creation of databases, Audatex has eight centrals distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialized in certain brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There are more than a hundred technicians (usually experts for mechanics) working simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests EUR 90 million each year in the development of these databases.
Each month they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive the updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use of repairs and repairs, but depending on the country there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the low or remaining value of a car.
The only company that informs about a driver about the value of the used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain but in the United States.
In the transparency of the products offered by Audatex, you can easily give yourself an overview of the kind of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products AudaPlus, a standard solution for the review of accidents for the advisors.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs of the parts, it contains the repair times or the salmon prices estimated by the manufacturer.
This tool is paid depending on the use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive it will be for customers that rarely use it to a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5,75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that makes thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the mounting band, solely using the driving order number.
AudaGlass is engaged in the car discs, and AudaSubastas is an open service for the professional market on the Internet, which can be used for vehicles that have been explained for total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, the implementation of geodemographical analyses or in order to obtain information about variations by brand and model.
For example, it is possible to examine how many models of a specific car brand had to be made in the workshop due to pans or how many of them were involved in a serious accident during a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this kind of computer tools.
It distributes among other Gt Estimate, which is also intended for advisors and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.

Improvement of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a plateau on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to 15% in the remainder next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increase with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively addressed to industry professionals, such as insurance companies, consultants, car rental companies, workshops, scrapplaces and car dealers that have to register before their activities.

According to the Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose vehicle has been logged out may no longer be driven on the Straβs, but it may be used as spare parts which are not damaged.
However, the cars of historical value may be re-approved even if they have been logged out after difficult authorities.
Cost forecast of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost proposal in just four steps:Identification of the vehicle, searching for the spare part, creating and creating a cost proposal.
The easy handling of these systems is a basic condition, especially to convince the elderly professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer technologies.
The database includes 1.034 vehicles, 666 of them are passenger vehicles, 109 land vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 small transporters and 44 trucks.
Of course you need a computer with Internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the bike number, a graphic of the respective model appears and the necessary spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for the hours of work, charges or discounts, and afterwards, he can print the cost preliminary effort and pass on to its customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for assessment such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workplace focused on the workshop does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool amounts to 350 euros a year, a amount that the customer can pay without delay.
The company Audatex is currently working to offer these images in three-dimensional formats.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, since you can select a door with it, for example, and then turn the image completely around to view the inside.
