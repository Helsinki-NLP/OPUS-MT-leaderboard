Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they are ‘to be compared with Muppets’
A proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welshe Parliament).
The proposal is a result of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name is ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP ‘surs on Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: twp is crazy for Welsh and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole is ‘inadequate’ and has proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welshe Conservative Party said that his party 'opens' for the change of name, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welshe letter W is expressed as a short you.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently taking up legislation to carry out the change of the name, said: ‘It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales itself that take the final decision on their new title.’
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, members of the National Assembly of Wales were entitled to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people thought that the National Assembly should be baptized into Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option was most supported in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have difficulty reaching a consensus and will have to submit a legislative draft on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms also includes other changes in the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committees system.
Members of the National Assembly will finally be able to vote on their new title when discussing legislation.
Inhabitants of Macedonia vote in a referendum on the amendment of the name of their country
On Sunday votes voters if they want to change the name of their country to 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to solve an intriguing dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athena has long claimed that the name of his northern neighbour means that the country would claim in its territory and has already repeatedly objected to Macedonia's applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who was against the referendum on the change of name, said that he would not take account of the outcome of the referendum.
However, representatives of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, suggest that the change of name is just the price to be paid to be a member of the EU and NATO.
The Saint Martin's bells are silent, those of Harlem have difficulty
"The older people I spoke with said that there was a café and a church in each corner earlier," said Mr Adams.
Today there is still a café, nor a church to detect."
He said it's understandable that cafés have disappeared.
'People have a different way of social contact,' he said.
“Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people regularly go.”
However, he is concerned that the earnings of the sales of the assets of the churches will be less long as the leaders expect, 'and they will be back early or late at the beginning'.
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments where the kind of people would not help in the remaining refugees of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of the people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white," he says, "which will lead to the close of these churches even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these apartments become members of the church community."
Both churches have ever been built by a white church community before Harlem became a black metropool: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church congregation of white methodists has gone in the 1930s.
A black church community from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from the shoppers in 125th Street, a major shop street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get or be promovated.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when the parochians of Eerwert Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beard.
Dear David Johnson, the son of Eerwert Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, called the beard pride “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the beard in July referred in another way to the instrument: 'a cultural treasure' and 'a unreplaceable historical instrument'.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beard in the world ever played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the bigger beard of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some hired by the church leaders, others by the bishop.
The consistency (the steering body of the parochia, consisting of leaky leaders) wrote the bishop in July to express its concern that the bishop would want to ‘recalculate the costs’ to the constory, although the consistency had not been involved in the hiring of the architects and participants who had sent the bishop.
Some parochians complained about the lack of transparency of the bishop.
Hay hurts 13-year-old who doaks to crops in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the lobby season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who crops douche in California.
The attack took place just 7 a.m. in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had fallen around half an hour with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy cry for help. Together with some others, he peddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy cried because he had captured a lobster, but then he realized that “the boy cried,“ I was beating!
I'm beats!"
His key leg was completely open,' seeing Hammel when he approached the boy.
"I screamed that everyone had to go out of the water, "There is a shark in the water!"
The boy was brought with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he seems to be in danger of life.
It is not conscious of the type of shark responsible for the attack.
Captain Larry Giles told us at a press conference that had been a shark nearby a few weeks earlier, but then it had been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured on the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through in the British beauty market
Sainsbury's deals with the competition with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams and creates beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in storehouses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household articles continues to fall. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 stores throughout the country. If they prove to be a success, they will be introduced in even more shops next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also due to the fact that supermarkets want to fill the bills where TVs, magnetrons and interior articles were ever in place with other products.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including first brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing gamma of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also gets more space, with tables per brand, such as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up again on the market, now that most products are suitable for veganists, something that young shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, parfumery the Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first one was opened in Croydon, south of London, the second one will be opened later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
Because more and more people shop online and more and more frequently buy small quantities of food on daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says that the shops will look more and more like storehouses, now that the supermarket chain takes it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sale of food has increased and the acquisitions have resulted in more profit.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments beauty and pharmacy a make-over, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but cooperation was terminated when there was a conflict about the distribution of revenues from the pharmaceutical department in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's 281 pharmacy departments in the shops three years ago for a amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan by adding an extensive gamma of luxury marks for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have completely changed the establishment of our beauty department so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands, we offer for every wish, and thanks to the attractive environment and the convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us and no longer shop in the old way."
Peter Jones' raging' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'bounding' because TV-presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is once compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The 37-year-old presentatrice of This Morning announced at Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is raising on Holly Willoughby, because she has at last withdrawn from their profitable lifestyle company to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was ‘bounding’ when Willoughby was on Tuesday during a difficult meeting in the company’s capital in Marlow, Buckinghamshire announced that she did not hold enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories by her new contracts (with a value of up to one and a half million pounds).
The company is once compared with the Goop of Gwyneth Paltrow brand and expected to double Willoughby's fortune of estimated 11 million pounds.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced in Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left to one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, "Truly was one of Holly's top priorityes.
It would ensure its future in the long term and provide enough for the next decades.
Everybody was awkward when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was planned soon.
The cartridge of the main place in Marlow is full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presentatrice, one of the most profitable stars in Great Britain, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from kisses and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now increase further delays.
And that could mean the end of a years of friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been well friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became the company's president in March.
The two teams often go together on vacation, and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is soon a brand ambassador of M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a presentor of the I'm A Celebrity programme on the British broadcaster ITV.
A source from the entourage of Jones said last night: 'We have no comments on his business matters.'
Hard language 'and then it was love between us'
He was joking about the criticism he would receive in the media for a comment he made that some people would find ‘unemost for a president’ and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitate a news anchor when he said:
'I didn't give up anything.'
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a great step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have been concluded.
More than three months after the Summit in Singapore in June, the top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a ‘comparable response’ by the United States after the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States continues with its sanctions to keep pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We do it very well in North Korea," he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results. The missile tests have been terminated, hostages have been liberated and the material surpluses of American militarymen have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach as regards his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave as a president, but instead of 100,000 people who try to access this pressure arena, about 200 people would stand here,” said Trump, while he was to the public before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island where hundreds of deaths fall
In the afterlife of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had no residence, no national disaster was announced, which is a requirement for the launch of international assistance.
'In many cases it is unfortunately clear that they do not seek international assistance, which is difficult for us,' said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is working on the creation of a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure whether the help providers from abroad can work on the site.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the Assistance Agency in national disasters, said that Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh shelters were built to hide at tsunamis, but along other coasts you can only rarely see these.
The fact that there was no warning sirene for tsunamis present in Palu, even though a warning was effective, has probably contributed to the number of deaths.
In ideal circumstances it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was assembled in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is now on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship has reached the place of the disaster.
The improvement of the oceanless infrastructure of Indonesia was one of the key points of the election campaign of President Joko Widodo, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko has a lack of funding, and that while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Yoko is also pressured by persistent sectaric tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority today follow a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their home because Christian and Islamic gangs fight on the street, with makers, arrow and bow, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool provides impressive equalizer to Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge preserved Liverpool last Saturday for loss against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, at the moment his plough stood behind with 1-0.
He thicked left against the ball and then pushed towards the farest stake.
The ball flew high above the penal area, in the direction of the right top corner of the net.
He escaped Kepa Arrizabalaga's jump and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much as possible,” said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and daring an attempt. I didn't really think about it, I just shot on the ball."
Chelsea stood at the rest of 1-0, after a target of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The tip of The Blues pushed the ball with his hill to Mateo Kovacic, and he speeded himself through the center to Liverpool's playhole.
Kovacic did a fast one-two in the middle.
Afterwards he gave a beautiful stickpass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and pushed the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the back stake.
Liverpool plays on Wednesday at 15 o'clock in the group phase of the Champions League against Napoli, in the San Paolo Stadium in Napels, Italy.
Chelsea starts on Thursday at 15 o'clock in London against Videoton in the UEFA Europe League.

The position of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-rel
The banishing of the statue would be a poetic justice for the talibanic destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described the suggestion of Mr. Crick as 'dwaas' and 'a attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was unavoidable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to showing the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that ruled in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that, according to many, still needs to be acknowledged.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy, by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today.
Whether that is a perfectly correct representation, it is still being debated.
What is certain is that in the middle of the 17th century the conflict has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognized figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognised and remembered."
Killing pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in the southwest China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, of whom only the aftername ‘Yuan’ is known, was found dead at a steel on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His stroke was boarded and he was under the blood, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the inhalation of pigs at a pig steel on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
Accordingly, he would have travelled from the neighbouring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday with his cousin.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and showed a door to a neighboring pigstall open.
According to the cousin, a large male pig with blood was found on his mouth in the swine shock.
According to the report, a forensic study showed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer.
“The legs of my cousin were bleeded and maligned,” said the cousin with the surname ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
On images of surveillance cameras, Yuan arrived on the market on Thursday at 4.40 o'clock to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not from Yuan or his cousin.
One responsible of the market told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent the other from attacking, while the police collected evidence in place.
Accordingly, the Yuan family and market authorities are currently negotiating a compensation for his death.
It happens rarely, but there have already been cases of pigs that attack people.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, making the man seriously hurt.
Ten years earlier, a swine of 300 kg was pushing a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife chopped the animal away.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News testified that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can cause aggression.
“They’re just playing.
They're just kids, very curious, they're not trying to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
The star of the orkan Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwest of the US
As foretold, orkaan Rosa has weakened as she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
At a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a local orcaan of category 1 on Sunday morning at 5 a.m. and was 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move to the north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trawl begins to form above the Pacific, which moves eastward to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northwards, to the southwest of the USA.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture reacting with the nearing trog will cause widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm rain will cause dangerous floods, ruin flows and possibly earth shifts in the desert.
Tropical moisture will lead to 5 to 8 cm downfall per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly worsening conditions, as the tropical rains can fall very widely.
It is strongly rejected to walk into the desert when the tropical rainfall threatens.
The heavy rainfall can transform ravines into desolate rivers, and storms will produce local wind and dust.
The nearing tray brings some heavy rain to parts of the coastline of South California.
Rain of 1.5 cm is possible, which could lead to small rainflows and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the region in the rainy season.
Spread tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday evening to Monday morning, and the rains will be spread more on Monday at the end of the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the US can fluctuate strongly, because the North Pole gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to great temperature differences over short distances.
There is a beautiful example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the US on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continuous summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the middle and east of the US, it is expected that October would begin warm, with temperatures that fluctuate around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can be 27 degrees Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chances for mid-October are high at higher average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people looked at the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday one of the six television networks to the violent witness of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. High Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault that appeared to take place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted the regular programming for the surprise of Friday: an agreement that was arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee for Justice that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was slain by her and tried to pull her clothes out during a festival at the middle school.
Kavanaugh explained in an intimate testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
Probably over the 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen have been watching on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately figures available for the other networks that sent the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who look at a office.
For comparison: that is about like for a play-off of a football race or for the Oscar ride.
Fox News Channel, which gives the name of Kavanaugh all support, had most viewers during the hearing day: averaged 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republic had issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the cameras of CNN and CBS registered on Friday morning that demonstrators screamed to him when he tried to take the lift to a hearing of the Commission for Justice.
He kept standing a few minutes with downfall eyes while he was embarrassed, live on CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone cried, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and just before the elevator, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various transmitters sent everything live out when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour with the insight that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominated against the next week, something that the Democrats of the minority insist on.
Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake took his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened a FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized their plans to leave the European Union of a ‘political game’ with the future of Great Britain and undermining national interests.
Premier of Great Britain Theresa May arrives at the Conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, the former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on its so-called Chequers plan for the Brexit.
Wayde Sims: Police arrests Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketballer at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and is in prison for suspicion of death, said the police of Baton Rouge.
The authorities brought out a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glass on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on the glass, WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is fixed at $350,000, reports the lawyer.
The body spectator of the municipality in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report on Friday stating that the cause of death is a shot in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Labor, Southern University police and local residents have all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports Director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his ‘intention and pursuit of justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm large and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He achieved average 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per race last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team 'capot' and 'in shock' was dead by Waydes.
“This is an event you always hope it will never happen,” says Wade.
Vulcan sprays in Mexico City
The axle that is sprayed out by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Centre for Rampen Prevention warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after the activity was picked up in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were registered for a 24-hour period.
The centre detected multiple rummels and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on carrots in districts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital city. This is the first time since September 2017, when a earthquake met with a force of 7.1 on the scale of Richter central Mexico.
The volcano, called 'Don Goyo', has been active since 1994.
Political clash with Catalan separatists on the morning of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists succeeded with the rebel police, while thousands of participation in rivalizing demonstrations at the occasion of the first birthday of the vote on independence in Catalonia which divided the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists retained by the reversal police coiled the agents with eggs and powder paints, which resulted in dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, screensets broke out with the police, and the cops picked up their knobs to stop the fights.
For more than one hour, pro-independence groups sang: ‘Do not forget, not forgive,’ while their opponents called ‘Long live Spain’.
Fourteen people were treated for light injuries that they suffered during the protests, reported the local press.
The tensions continue to rise high in the Independence Region, a year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters expressed themselves overwhelmingly to become independence, although the rise was low and the people who were opposed to separation were boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities last year, nearly 1,000 people were injured after the police had tried to stop the vote in the electoral offices in the region, in which it led to violent sculptures.
Pro-Independence Groups had camped the night of Friday on Saturday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s prospects of being independent.
“ Last year we have experienced one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're trapped," he said.
Although the Catalan Pro-Independence Parties in December gained an essential victory in the regional elections, even though that was a nephew, it was difficult for them to build on their success this year, because many of their most famous leaders are either absent in their own exile or in captivity, waiting for a legal case on their role in the organisation of the referendum and the proclamation of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old monastery who filmed the protest to support the police on his phone, said that the conflict was raised by politicians on both sides.
"The tensions are increasingly higher," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in preliminary arrest since the end of last year, declared that he took part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidate for European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after the house was hit by a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was repeatedly ratted in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 p.m.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building had been damaged themselves.
A crossbow may also have been fired on the car at a given time.
Livingston wins with 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promovated Livingston surprised the Rangers and delivered Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference, and the team of Gary Holt came at the same height as Hibernian.
Gerrard's team did not manage this season to win a competition during the Premiership. They have to take the Sunday against leader Hearts, which is eight points on them.
But first the Rangers Rapid Vienna receives Thursday in the Europe League.
Livingston remains unavailable in the meantime. The team now won six matches in his department, and trainer Holt hasn't had any defeat since he let Kenny Miler replace last month.
Livingston misses chances against strong visitors
The Holt's team had been able to achieve a precursor for a long time before the first goal. Because their direct way of playing was creating all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but did not succeed in finishing it with a target point. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up the headball of Craig Halkett, shot the ball above the target.
The home ployer left the Rangers playing with a lot of fun, and waited for his chances quietly and self-safe.
And that eventually led to the crucial objective.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingston provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scraped out of the penal area.
At that time, the Rangers have had balcony for a long time, but the defense of the home team was incorruptible and the targetman Liam Kelly has not had much to do yet.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos had to prevent Kelly from being targeted.
Scott Pittman pushed the ball against the feet of Rangers target Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a presentation of his colleagues in Livingston.
Continuingly, the prosecutors reached the penalty area of Livingston, but they were hosted each time. Two times a penalty team was refused, one after Halkett's attack on Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
"Phenomenal" of Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played excellent without exception and continue to overcome expectations in their race to the top.
Their playstyle and the composition of their team has almost changed since they returned to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has swept the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Chairman Halkett was fantastic, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes throughout the game.
However, the Rangers did not know how to break.
Although they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase was not good enough (they managed only once to swallow the home plough) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the classroom.
Erdogan is received with mixed feelings in Köln
Under a brilliant blue sky and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to breakfast together in Berlin on Saturday 29 September.
It was the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between the NATO councils.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Köln for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police called on safety reasons when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering for the mosque, but many sympathists came near to their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurden, also gave their voice, both condemning Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German government to welcome him in the country.
The rivalizing protests reflect the division of a visitor praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as a autocreat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicycler dies after car collapsing
In London, a cyclist died in a collapse involving a car.
The accident happened near the crossing point of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10.15 hours of local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died in the place.
A few months ago another bicycler died in an accident with flight crime on Childers Street, about a mile of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were going to tell the man and his nearest family.
The road is closed in various places, buses are redirected and automobilists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six cipiers injured in order disorder
Six cipiers have been injured in a order disorder in a severely protected prison for men, according to the prison office.
The troubles broke out on Sunday at about 9.30 p.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still running.
Specialized ‘Tornado’-cipiers have been committed to resolve the situation, involving eight prisoners in one section.
The cipiers were treated for light injuries in the face.
A spokesman of the Prisonism said: “The prison staff has been specially trained for a current incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and the responsible ones are, at least, referred to the police and may have to remain behind the trails.'
In HMP Long Lartin more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals of the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had been treated in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the rebel police were sent to prison for a serious order disorder in which staff were attacked with billions of balls.
Orkaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with potentially positive effects on drought areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy of Orcaan Rosa moves across the southwest of the desert area, which brings risks of flooding.
For Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service has already given warnings for sudden floods for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang on Tuesday right above Phoenix. On Monday night it's going to rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a twot that since 1950 only ten tropical cycles have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an orkan within 40 miles from Arizona's border.'
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 cm downfall, with isolated quantities up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Beach, are likely to get rain 3 to 5 cm, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For the regions that are not at risk of floods, the rains of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are very worrying, some of this rainfall is likely to be favourable, since the southwest is currently through a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are indicated, some more than 40 percent of Arizona is through at least extreme drought, the one on one highest category, reported Weather.com.
The path of the Orcaan Rosa reaches the continent through the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is still on turkey strength with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, which weakens it.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive Monday in the afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm in Mexico.
Heavy rains may fall in parts of Mexico, with a significant flooding risk.
“A total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,” reported Weather.com.
Rosa moves northward over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona in the early mornings as a tropical depression, which will then be late Tuesday evening by Arizona and in the south of Utah.
“The greatest danger that Rosa or her star is expected is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and the southwest of the desert area” said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and ruin flows in the deserts and earth-sharing in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempt to kill
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspicion of attempts to kill after a 16-year-old was found in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton at about 4 o'clock.
He was brought to the hospital and his condition is 'stiff'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area in the night, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The police ask everyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has been 'for now under the common, the anger of the Democratic Party'
'A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the incessant and scandalous tactic of the Democratic Party', said Trump during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Mr Trump said that during his appointment procedure Kavanaugh has been constantly 'forth under the common, the anger of the Democratic Party'
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Congress on Thursday and deceived the attack of Christine Blasey Ford strongly and emotionally that he had attacked her sexually decades ago when she was teenager.
Ford also witnessed her approach during the hearing.
On Saturday the president said that the "American people" saw the wonderful and incredible character, the quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
“A voice to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a voice that recognises one of the most complete legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,” he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
“One of the most important elections in our life will take place over five weeks.
I don't take part, but I actually take part," he said.
'Therefore, I am coming up for great candidates everywhere.'
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to 'presume resistance and impede us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a top employee of the GOP management to CNN.
Hundreds kill by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll gets increasing
At a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, and many were devastated from the ground when gigantic waves fell on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters hit land at the time it began to shake. Many people collapsed and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of a earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not walk away immediately and thus became victims of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Bureau for aid to natural disasters BBP during a lettering in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: he pulled cars, trees, houses, he touched everything on the country," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coastal line.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
On air photos released by the Bureau for Help in Natural Catastrophes, it is to see that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city remained shaken by aftershoes.
The range of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a statement that the energy released from the huge earthquake of Friday was about 200 times the force of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima during the Second World War.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, small bay, has still expanded the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels had crashed.
Some deadly victims were trapped under the ruin of decayed buildings, he said. About 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage can be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in a area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication with Donggala 'lights completely flat, we have no information at all,' said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse,” said the Red Cross.
The organization was very critical on Saturday because she had not said that a tsunami Palu had hit, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time when the warning was given.
In amateur pictures shared on social media, a man at the upper floor of a building in panic screams to people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water rushs on the coast, and buildings and cars are swallowed.
Reuters couldn't check the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami ensured a major storm that cut down communication around Palu, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending trucks with aid goods from Jakarta and other cities, said the authorities, but the evacués still need food and other basic needs.
The city airport has only been reopened for assistance and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Dodentol of tsunami rises above 800.
It's really bad.
Although the employees of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the inside of their office are searching for dive in tents of decks, but they passed on the way of destruction, said Doseba.
"They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid groups started the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with great expertise.
According to Indonesia's regulation, funding, goods and staff from abroad can only be allowed if the location of a disaster is called out as a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
'As the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster', we can provide international assistance, but that status is still not called out.'
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing ones remained hoping that they would find their loved ones back to life, such as in the miracles that people like this would like to belong to terrible natural disasters.
On Saturday a boy was taken out of a riot.
On Sunday, helpers delivered a woman who had stuck two days under the ruin with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional tax," he said.
Mr. Gendon told that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had crashed had spread in the paragliding community and that he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one grey pink appeared instead of two blue pinks.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26.750 during the supply of money automate in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thiefs stole $26.750 from a Brink coworker who was filling a money car in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport's police.
The driver had just borrowed a money automaat in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill him with money, according to Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the report.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's staff and stole a bag of money ready to deliver.
Witnesses saw several suspects of flights, according to the press release, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the offenders is asked to contact the Newport Police at number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Previous Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘The being which is formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the course of his action at Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singers Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the maker of the show.
Ye is not just a abbreviation of his present artist name. Previously, West told that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I believe that ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘ye’, said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album with the radiopresenter Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, we are.
I've passed over from Kanye, which means 'the only one', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is rather a reflection of who we are."
He's not the only famous rapper that changes his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love this year.
JAY-Z, who worked with West earlier, has also worked with and without the link sign and the uppercase letters.
Mexican President promises not to use forces against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected President of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against citizens. The country is on the premise of the 50th birthday of a bloody represaille against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would not “use military violence to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired a peaceful demonstration on the square, where 300 people were killed. During that period, left student movements came up throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs due to unemployment and lack of learning opportunities.
United States must double financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount they spend on research of A.I., says investor and A.I.-specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in the light of the announcements on A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced his plan last year: by 2030, the country wants to be the number 1 in the area of A.I. innovations.
'The budget for research on A.I. would already be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.', said Lee.
A double of the funding could result in a double of the chance that the next big achievement for A.I. will take place in the US, said Lee this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the most important A.I. companies in China.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that lost American Othello's best player, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Department of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competition organized by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next match would take place, because it would help to discover the following visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get public subsidies, said Lee.
"China doesn't put our best academics in, the companies do that," said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have in recent years acquired the best forces of universities to work on A.I..
Lee said that American efforts in A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
‘Who doctors in A.I. should automatically be offered a green card’, he said.
The Chinese National Council published its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Nature Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Ministry of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve industrial and academic partners in the initiative, and announced the White House the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence).
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the American legislation that should lead to the establishment of a national Security Committee for Artificial Intelligence has been in the process for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change in their country's name
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change in their country's name in 'Republic of North Macedonia', which would impose a dispute with Greece that has been cast on for decades and would no longer hinder Greece's Macedonian application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour contains that the country claims in Greek territory, and thus Greece put its veto against the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and the NATO.
In June, the two governments concluded an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavian majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and by a boycot campaign it is not sure that the required rise of at least 50 per cent will be achieved, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the voting panel was formulated as follows: ‘Do you support NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
‘Individuals, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, feel that the price to be paid is worth trying to become a member of bodies like the EU and the NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that originated when the former Yugoslavia fell apart.
“I vote today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the paraply of the European Union, because this will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, sufficient Members of Parliament have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
For the change of name, a second-third in Parliament would be required.
The National Elections Committee said that there had not been any reports of irregularities at 13 o'clock.
At that time, however, the rise was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a electorate in the capital of Skopje.
Premier Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Srumica, Macedonia, during the referendum about the country's name change, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
For the Parliament in Skopje, the 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small podium and put chairs for tents placed by people who had the referendum boycotts.
“We are the supporter of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back gate,” said Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European Asian integration."
Premier Zaev says that the NATO membership will provide necessary investments for Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
'I am convinced that the vast majority is a supporter, because more than 80% of our citizens are EU and NATO', said Zaev after his vote.
He said that a 'yes' would be 'a confirmation of our future' as a result.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43% of the voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required rise.
From another peiling, performed by the hot Macedonian Television Station Telma TV, it was concluded that 57 percent of respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of them would vote yes.
If the referendum is successful, it must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious lap for the policy of the pro-west government since it came to power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and Scoort
Previous Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short measuring with the defense of Brighton at the Etihad Stadium in the English Manchester. Manchester City won the match with 2-0.
It looked like a bottle of a cent, as Aguero scoorded in the 65th minute.
The Argentine spits first played the ball on the center.
He raced between three Brighton defensors, right in the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew to pass a defender and was too fast for some others at the edge of Brighton's penal area.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the penal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat target Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
“We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a target at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he stood deep in the playground of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful stickpass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball a minute and then sent Sterling to the second stake.
The Sky Blues player tipped the ball in the net, just before he was too far.
City takes it Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoffenheim at the Champions League's group phase. The match will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play with and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the play-off, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Yet, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still effects on the participation of the Rockies in the play-off. They are currently standing for one match at the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least authorised a wildcard for the play-off thanks to their 5-2- victory against the Nationals last Friday, but they want to do everything to ensure their first section title.
“Although there's nothing in it for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be with this public optimal and the other team probably plays at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in that?'
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to set up Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, stood in the field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although it's normal to rest.
The legally handed rear of Washington stands on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trump organizes meeting in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while he spoke of the importance of the Republican rise in the interim elections.
“All that we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our life will take place.
This is one of the really great elections, and I am not taking part, but I am actually taking part, and therefore I am coming up for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happen now.
And they're determined to take the power back, regardless of what they're supposed to do for it.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to wipe away to gain power and control, that's what they want: power and control, but we will not give them that."
The Democrates, he said, are on a mission to offer 'resistance and hinder us'.
'And we've seen that in the last four days,' he said, calling the Democrats 'boose and common and false and lieful'.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to a loud call from the public.
"Do you remember what she answered?
Did you read the document?
Uh, eh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a wide church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When the activists of Momentum voted in my local party to censor me, that was not a surprise.
Finally, I'm the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who got us not welcome just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she resolutely opposed antisemitism.
In my case, I was punished with the censur motive because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, on the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, similar issues like those in which Jeremy did not agree with former leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it stated: 'We want the meetings to be including and productive.'
And that was the same during most GC meetings on Friday evening during the eight years that I have already been a local Labour Parliament member.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and has long forgotten the promise of a 'pleasanter, softer' politics, if she had ever started.
It becomes increasingly clear that a deviation is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable for the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader. Collegas who, as far as I knew, had a similar political view as I, suddenly expected that I would make a reverse and take a position that I would never have agreed to, from subjects like national security to the European unity market.
Every time I speak to a public, whatever I say, there are social media guilt parties calling for the rejection of my candidateship as a Member for the next elections, which reveals the policy of the centre and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm through.
In fact, I know that I have more happiness than some of my colleagues, because the comments on my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionality and determination of those colleagues who are dealing with a flood of sexual or racist reactions every day, but are not intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that it appears to be considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of mistrust’ or change of selection rules, the party becomes smaller.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to keep my mind down, not to preach my opinion loudly, and then I would not ‘come in trouble’.
But I did not go into politics for this.
Since I became a schoolchild member of Labour 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of the government of Thatcher, which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always appealed for better public services for those who they need most, both in my role as a municipal member and in my role as minister.
I never kept my politics hidden, nor at the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policies and my disputes with the current leadership.
To those who have propagated the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves on to a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy to my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact I have only one message, which is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that threatening to reject my candidateship for the next elections or political opportunities will not prevent me from acting according to what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsaved Ayr on the way to the top
Two late trials may have taken the final outcome somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr triumphates rightly in this delicious race of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're upstairs in the classroom, the only unwrought team of the ten.
Eventually, both their superior defense and their better chances that the home team brought the victory, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
"We have already had a difficult time during our matches and we are still unsuccessful, so I'm a happy man," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose: 'All honor to Ayr, they have used their chances better than we.'
Grant Andersons trys in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a precursor for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish national plough (which he received during the Warriors match) Melrose was able to make the figures speak and Jason Baggot succeeded in breaking a try.
Climo provided a penalty for an extra advance for Ayr and scoorded a conversion after a solotry net for rest. Thus it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well, and the experiment of Patrick Anderson, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the premature to five points.
The game was a long time silent for a serious blessure of Ruaridh Knott, which was taken off on a brancard, and once the game was restarted, Ayr could continue to run out by a try of Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then commander Blair Macpherson of Ayr received a yellow card, and again Melrose ran off with the extra man when no conversion followed on a sample of Bruce Colvine at the end of a match where the pressure was very high.
However, the home ploy came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tackled Climo without the ball, MacPherson provided a touch-down on the penalty line-out behind the exciting Ayr wall.
Climo cared for the conversion, and did that almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe kicked the box of David Armstrong and halfback Gregor Henry sent away for the fifth try of the home ploy.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like Actor Ford Kieran goes from Still Game into the horeca. He is apparently appointed to be director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he acts himself with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the coming nineth series will be the last in the series, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craig.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor didn't want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scotish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the 'blooding restaurant business' in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': the country incorporated Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Seelui patrols in a dressed marine office in La Paz.
On public buildings, a ocean blue flag wappers.
On all seabases from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
In all the land surrounded by Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country has had to resist after a bloody nineteenth-century conflict of raw materials to Chile is still alive, as is the desire to retain the Pacific.
This hope may have reached its highest point in the last decades, since Bolivia is waiting for a decision of the International Court of Justice, which should be discussed on 1 October after five years.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, of course, looks forward to the result with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians throughout the country will view the Court's judgment on large screens, in the hope that the Tribunal in the Hague will plead for the benefit of Bolivia that Chile is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea after decades of pleasant conversations.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, which is next year in favour of a controversial struggle for re-election, is a lot at stake with the statement of Monday.
"We are very close to the return to the Pacific," he swore at the end of August.
However, some analyticals believe that the court will probably not decide to benefit Bolivia, and even if it was, there would be little change.
The UN body established in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of First Instance falls only six months after the final proceedings indicates that the case was ‘non-complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result of Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, in the past four years, the situation may even have worsened.
“The case about access to the sea has been captured by the present Bolivian government,” said Zárate.
Morales' war-like retoric has all the good will that Chile might have undermined completely, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue with their conversations at a certain time, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further.
The two countries have not been ambassador in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, representing Bolivia in the Hague, denies that the court's decision has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “a extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to“end one to 139 years of differences of opinion, with mutual benefits”, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular Presidents of Latin America, uses the maritime issue as a political crown.
'Bolivia will never give up his right to access the Pacific,' he added.
'The pronunciation is an opportunity to see that we should leave the past behind us.'
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the U.S.
The North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if Washington can't trust.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the moment that State Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the fastening nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the top meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it is a 'utopia' that the lasting sanctions and the American objection against a declaration to terminate Korean war will ever get North Korea on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without that Pyongyang first takes important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would dismiss from an arsenal that the country probably sees as his only way to guarantee his security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second top meeting between Kim and Trump.
Modeshows in Paris reveal the latest collection huge head covers, soon for sale with you nearby
If you want to expand your watch collection or keep the sun out of your eyes, don't look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a series of crazy oversized head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very unpractical hats were not to think away this summer from Instagram, and these designers sent their eye blinding creatives to the catwalk.
The spectacular piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a featuring wide edge, which hanged over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were water melons occupied with precious stones, a magic hat and even an ananas, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
In many of the colorful masks, the lips were tightened. They looked more like Hannibal Lecter than on haute couture.
One creative looked like diving equipment, complete with snorkel and glass, while another looked like a smelted ice.
And if you want to follow this dwelling mode, you're lucky.
Stylewatchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The giant hats may be inspired by 'La Bomba', the strawn hat with a two meters wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very unpractical hat that pops up on social media also provided another big creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathpack that the bag sealed.
The roodoranje raffia bag, disposed of raffia francs and finished with a white leather hanging, was the most outstanding piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous silencer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the shops. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Talents Essential for World Citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, and also individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other initiatives of the whole community.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for continued and higher education, their chosen career and their place as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a graduate school course, we see that modern languages remain popular and desired fields in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we can not only trust in English when we want to build relationships and a trust band with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results of this year, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the ranking list, with the highest success rates within independent schools.
Overall, 68 percent of the students who studied strange languages had a high score.
The data collected from 74 schools associated with SCIS show that 72 percent of students had a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72% of students German, 69% of students French and 63% of students also received a A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now being appreciated as professional as STEM subjects (science, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.
According to employers, a study by the British Employment and Vkillness Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the obstacles to filling vacations were attributed to a lack of language knowledge.
Language skills are thus increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now that more and more vacancies require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he has a real advantage in the future with such skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person a proximity to competition.
According to a YouGov survey among more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 per cent was unable to speak a strange language well enough to conduct a conversation. French was the only language that exceeds 10 per cent, with a total of 15 per cent.
This is the reason why investment in language education is now important for today's children.
A number of languages, in particular those of upcoming economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools work to provide a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain of vital importance in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il runs bien le faire.

LeBron makes Sunday his debut at the Lakers in San Diego
Fans waiting for the first match of LeBron James at the Los Angeles Lakers, the waiting is almost over.
Lakers-coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the opening competition before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It's still time to determine how many minutes he's going to play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a twot that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers schedule for the six matches preceding the season.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need any matches before the season to prepare me," he said.
Period of election rally of Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of elections
It's the first of five planned rally's of Trump in the next week, including stops in places that affect him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he prefers to be held in the High Court of Justice, Trump wants to build support for the coming interim elections, since the Republicans are at risk of losing control over the Convention when voted in November.
What time does Trump's rally start tonight and how do you look online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starting tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 p.m.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings for candidate-prior Brett Kavanaugh this week, which were extra loaded now that Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait for a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the elan elan elan elan in November.
The campaign leadership of President Trump said that these five rallys are intended to ‘promote volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Delegates’, according to Reuters.
“Control on the Congress is so important for its programme that the president travels to as many states as possible now the pressing campaign starts” said a spokesman of the Trump campaign that did not want to be named against Reuters.
The rally of tonight in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, said West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia visited is the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the peils.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the peilings,” said Simon Haeder, politician at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is willing to fight to keep the hope alive in the run to the singles of Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swallowing swing of chances is a fully discovered sport concept, but a real player believes, and especially in competitions like this.
So who's getting the best chance at the moment?
'They first had a precursor of six points, and now it's only four more, so we think that the happiness is at present on our side,' said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage that it stands for four points, while there are twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spieth said, find that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, each three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearable opponent from tea to green and he gives the good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed, and he achieved a crucial well with which four matches became a success when he and Thomas stood behind two points after two matches.
His well with which they won the race at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind you can derive from that he believes that the U.S. team has not yet been hit.
"You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game," said Spieth.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the uncontroversial story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable, but delicious European duo has four in four and cannot do anything wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that did not play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning, they avoided bogey's.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their rumourous public, they are the players who have to be hit on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever who books a European victory when the sun goes down above Le Golf National.
Preferred both at the same time at different holes.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short mets with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of the morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backstand for the Spaniard and the Swedish that they did not get over.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get your back.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see the interactions between the duo's, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in an eye.
Until now, the European team has played the best and has a beautiful lead at the start of the last day, but this four-seven session has also shown that Team USA is willing to go to the fight, something which some doubts, especially in the US.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a beautiful precursor on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday, they stand on the United States with 10-6.
The targeted duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, who had difficulty, which now leads four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, that the trophy she lost in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but could not recover his backstand.
Jim Furik's team must score eight points during the 12 singles races of Sunday to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer who wins four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname 'Molliwood' after a sensational weekend, are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup that wins four points in their four opening competitions.
After they had made Woods and Patrick Reed into the four-balls, they were beautifully recorded on each other and disappointed a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who slurred himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally showed a wonderful move, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and joined the Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
However, it did not run from a lead roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the norm for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later lost Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It was only twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team could have retired four points at the beginning of the singles, although the team of Furijk has enough equality, since they currently have the trophy in hands.
But now that they have been in the second place for two days, an anti-attack seems too high on Sunday.
North Korea says that it will "in no case" unanimously disarmament without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions lead to increasing mistrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country would not be able to give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations Annual General Assembly that North Korea had ‘from major goodwill measures’ in the last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the location of nuclear tests and the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We do not see a similar response from the US,” he said.
'Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be disarmed by one side.'
Although Ri repeated the known North Korean complaints about the resistance of Washington against a 'fashioned' approach to denuclearisation, with which North Korea would be rewarded as the further steps were taken, it was noticed that he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation a priori, as Pyongyang earlier did.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim promised to work on the ‘deuclearisation of the Korean peninsula’, while Trump promised guarantees for the safety of North Korea.
North Korea aims at a formal end of the Korea war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also opposed calls to facilitate the harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'decularisation first' and increases pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compulsory way and even by objecting to the 'Declaration of the End of War', said Ri.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a aircastle of the people who are unconscious of us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only strengthen our mistrust.'
Ri did not mention plans for a second top meeting between Kim and Trump, something that the U.S. leader had been calling to the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: ‘If the other party was in this question of denuclearisation South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come into such an impasse.’
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year, when he said to the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles on the American continent were directed after ‘Mr. Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'raketman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised Kim this year to the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that there should be much more to happen and that the sanctions should remain to North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no timetable for this: ‘Where it takes two years, three years or five months, that doesn't matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, the US State Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: 'The enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be effectively and certainly continued until we have achieved the complete, definitive, verified denuclearisation.'
Since 2006, the Security Council has carried out unanimous sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Nearly a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea insisted him on 'tolerating demands'.
North Korea promised this month, at a meeting with Moon, to dismantle a missile and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take ‘even measures’.
He said that Kim had told him that the ‘comparable measures’ he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students from Harvard follow course on the importance of sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing machoculture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink much cafeine.
A professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist associated with the Brigham and Women's Hospital, set up the course. As far as he knows, this is unique in the US.
He got the idea of starting the course after giving a talk about the influence of sleep loss on learning.
"At the end of my speech, a girl came to me that said, "Why can I only hear this in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, what surprised me,' he said to The Telegraph.
The course, which is organised this year for the first time, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help improve the academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university health services, decided to organise the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep shortage during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the parts, the students see a picture of a sleeping room, where they click on coffee, garments, exercise devices and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is influenced by a lack of sleep, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another part, participants are told how long - term sleep shortage increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
With a flat ground of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the conduct of the students instantly.
But we think they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of the choice of cigarettes on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of fieryness at night is still being studied, he says, and through modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep shortage is an increasing problem.
To ensure sufficient sleep, of good quality, the student's ‘holy weapon’ must be to fight stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because the brain is making them feel constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course, for last year he had followed lessons with the professor when he studied Harvard in his first year.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to ensure that the course was available to everyone on the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study programme before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set an alarm for their bedtime, not only an alarm to stand up. They also need to be aware of the harmful effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and led lighting, which can disregard your circadiaan rhythm, allowing you to have an effort to fall into sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Menga makes the men of Gerrard fall
The Rangers saw their race again disappointing when Dolly Menga scoorded and the weak team of Steven Gerrard lost with 1-0 in Livingston.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during a race since they ended in February St Johnstone with 4-1, but the team of Gary Holt took care of the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team now stands eight points behind Hearts, which goes further on the top of Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scoorded at seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers did not succeed in scoreing the equalizer.
The Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in the number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could even have more problems, since the frontier Calum Spence had to be treated for a main wound after apparently a object was thrown to him by the supporters of the visitors' team.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team, put Ayr over and go to the half finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt remained at the same elf valley for Livingston, which the Hearts knew a point last week. He would have been excited about the way his well trained plough was able to block the opponents on every move.
The Rangers may have had most balcony, but Livingston did more.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga gave off the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the victory, but the middle fielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free staircase of Keaghan Jacobs reached Commander Craig Halkett, but his colleague defenseman Alan Lithgow pushed against the back stake.
The Rangers managed to take over the control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than that they really believed in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos, in any case, found that he had the right to a courtship when he and Steven Lawless were inflicted after a quarter, but divorce judge Steven Thomson rejected the request of the Colombian.
The Rangers were only able to shoot twice to the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was a former targetman at the Ibrox, could easily stop the headball of Lassana Coulibaly and the tamme shot of Ovie Ejaria.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute should not be in the extension of the general game course, no one can deny that they deserved this, although it was only for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers weren't washed up against Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and chose Menga, who drove the ball with ease in the goal.
Gerrard made a break with the exchange Coulibaly/Ryan Kent. This move had almost immediate consequences when the wing player Morelos passed, but a impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play the kind of match that Livingston prefers to play, where Lithgow and Halkett continue to step long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the last stage of the game, but McGregor kept standing well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
At the end of the race, Glenn Middleton invaded a penalty gun after an experience with Jacobs, but Thomson looked on the other side.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geigerteller
And now a page from the almanak of our ‘Sunday Morning’: 30 September 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom can TELLEN... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device named geigerteller.
The geiger counter has not been thinking away from science since then, and also became an icoon in popculture, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: 'What the hell is that?'
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you hear the effect of the atoms issued by radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "It's really cracking now!"
'Hans' Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that wears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ malicious cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malicious cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize malicious cells in the course of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a lab
They can then ‘see’ a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and are then injected again
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malicious cells saw her ovary cancer disappear more than 18 months
The method removes immune cells in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they are the protein HER2, which often occurs in all types of cancer, can ‘see’. Then the cells are injected again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘ stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovary cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to removing immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ these cells to treat cancer cells has already been shown to work in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West turns off pro-Trump-Tirade and wears MAGA-pet after his appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was exhibited during a release of Saturday Night Live after an unchanged action in which he praised the American president Donald Trump and said he becomes presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third number of the evening, Ghost Town, with a pet on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he cut off a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white man, he asks: ‘How can you now have sympathy for Trump? He is a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I had been out of America for a long time, he said.
The release of Saturday Night Live began with a parodie in which Hollywood star Matt Damon drew the dragon with the witness of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee for Justice in connection with the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford accuses him.
The tigers of West weren't sent out, but comics Chris Rock uploaded them to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to strike the dragon with West with his post.
West also complained against the public that he had been taken backstairs under fire for his pet.
“They have tested me backstairs.
They said, 'Don't stand on the podium with that pet.'
They tricked me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: 'Would you see how apathetic it looks?' He said he would attract them superman cape, 'because that means you can't order me. Do you want the world to be better?
Give me some love."
From the public at least twice the castle members of SNL came in a shame, according to Variety. The magazine was heard from a present: ‘The entire studio was suddenly silent.’
West was too guest as last-minute replacer of singers Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the number I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who twot: 'On one of our most courageous spirits: BEDANKING YOU THE MASSA TROTSEER.'
But talkshow-presentatrice Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just ‘usually himself, and that's beautiful.’
“But I choose to support and spray someone who hurts and hurts my community, NOT reward (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his “kunst”).
He's free to do what he wants.
We too, she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on he is, he says, "the being that is formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist who changed his name, he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collega-rapper Snoop Dogg also wore the name Snoop Lion and the deceased prince ever changed his name into a symbol and then in The artist formerly known as Prince.
Attack of attempt to kill after stack party in restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempting to kill after a man was put down on Friday in a restaurant in the east of Belfast.

The accusation will be examined by the Public Ministry.
Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington picks out to toxic maleness
Kit Harington is known for his role of sword fighter Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor pulls out to the stereotype of the macho hero and says that when young boys see such rolls on the screen, they often think they need to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he thinks that ‘there has been something wrong’ and he asked himself how to address the problem of toxic maleness in the period of #MeToo.
Kit, who has recently married his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
'This is really an important question for me personally at present: where has our maleness been wrong?' he said.
"What have we learned men when they grew up, so that we are faced with this problem now?"
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic maleness, by his very male figures.
He continued: "What has been born and what has been learned?"
What is learned on TV and on the streets that young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of today's major questions: how do we change that?
'Cause there's obviously something wrong for young men.'
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games or Thrones if the series is over next summer, because he is ‘complete with battlefields and horses’.
Since November, Kit plays in a revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is overfaller.
The actor recently revealed that his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I've met my wife during the series, so this way I've kept my future family and my life on it from now on," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits personage Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple was married in June 2018 on Leslies family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were passed through sex, which was not the case before.
HIV has rapidly spread in some parts of China by transfusions of infected blood in the past.
But the number of people in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officers said during a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
The transfer of HIV via sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has no longer been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
As a result of the conservative values of land, studies estimated that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often, the diseases are transferred by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese authorities have promised universal access to HIV medication in the context of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the staff cooperator has read data from Republican senators and extracts from ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘complot theory’
The U.S. Congress member Maxine Waters objects to the accusations that one of its staff staff has placed the personal data of three US republikan senators on the Wikipedia page of the lawgivers.
The Democrat of Los Angeles claims that the accusations are distributed by ‘extreme-right’ disputers and websites.
“Lyes, lies and more common lies,” said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and the private phone number of the American senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the accusations of sexual misconduct to the address of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators had examined Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pondit and RedState, the IP address that the source of the posts indicates was linked to the Waters Office and contained the information of a Waters staff, said the Hill.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie," said Waters.
‘My employee, whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no case responsible for leaking these information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a flagrant lie."
The statement of Waters was already quick to criticize online, including by the former press co-worker of the White House Ari Fleischer.
'This denial sounds angry,' wrote Fleischer.
“This makes it clear that she does not have the temperament to be a Congress member.
If someone is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He should not ask the prosecutor's motives.
He must stay calm and calm."
Kater appeared to compare the response of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of excessive evil during the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters' place in the interim elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
"Happy, if it's true," he twined.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and enforcement authorities of these false accusations.
'We will ensure that the deeds become known,' they said, 'and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff employees.'
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parodie with Rowan Atkinson
In each new film with a British record, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that seems to be true of this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a soft spy in the main role, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was resumed in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy evening about how bad we do the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with exquisite eyes and flexible visions, at least, succeeds in sending everything in the hundred, including his second comeback. From his name you can already derive that he is a general comic personage that was designed for bioscoopers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
Of course, he is the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim on smooth glamour, a little Clouseau, a wings of Mr. Bean and a piece of that guy who contributed one note to the Chariots or Fire theme number during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
He is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson ever played in the Barclaycard TV spots (which everyone has been forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain chaos.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and ticks the rotor sheets against his helmet.
Atkinson can show well in this film how much talent he has for physical comedie, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough, especially now that the "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible self comedie includes as an ingredient, and do that good.
The humor seems to be more intended for children than for adults, and the stupid calamity of Johnny English comes on me less originally and focuses on the jokes without the text of the personage Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Great Britain is in great difficulties.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all active secret agents of Great Britain known, to a great disarmament of the agent in function, unfortunately a small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that makes the emmer crossing the first minister, a pretentiful woman with problems at her head and terrible unpopulary as a politician. Emma Thompson is doing her best with this personage that reminds Teresa May, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her information advisers, she must use a retired spy as each active spy is compromited.
And that means the stunning Johnny English himself, who now works as a school master in a chique institution, but informs inofficial lesson about undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because English's spy lessons are thinking about School of Rock.
English is quickly offered at Whitehall for an emergency mailing and reunited with his former sorrowful help Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a stupid and jovial role that is under Vicki Pepperdines level.
So the Batman and Robin of the catastrophic conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is unfortunately in favour of the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire that claim that he can solve the British computer problems: the synthetic Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start with their odyssee of clever dolle fun: dressed as obers they burn a deliberate French restaurant, they cast herry on board the luxury hunt of Volta and English distracts pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
For that last, all records are opened, but no matter how well-destined and insulty the scene is, they do something to think about child television.
It's not all very original.
And like the other films of Johnny English, I ask myself the question: Can the British film sector really not really think of a role that honors the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies that the party is considering a plan in which British work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan in which British work four days a week but get paid for five days.
Accordingly, the party would want companies to give their employees the savings they do as a result of the revolution of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) by giving them an extra day holiday.
In this way, workers can enjoy a weekend of three days, but still earn the same.
According to sources, the idea in the party's economic agenda and the plans to make the country's balance is 'passing' in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was already approved by the Vak Associations' Associations that it is a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-placed source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: “After expectation, a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place at the other time, but a four-day working week is a goal that fits within the party's efforts to make the balance in the economy more favourable to the workers and that also fits within the overall industrial strategy of the party."
Labour is not the first party that supports such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party already promised a four-day working week in the country election campaign of 2017.
However, it is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said: "A four-day working week is not a political action of the party and is not considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his view of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from the 'sightless drivers' and the 'profits' in the businesses.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not receive the full value of their shares, as a Labour Government could apply 'shorts' based on observed misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include workers in the management boards of businesses and to set up inclusive property funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) which give 10% of the shares of companies from the private sector to employees who can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' or the FBI research to Kavanaugh can make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the High Court of Justice by at least one week and asks whether the findings of the FBI could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI could discover something that could lead to their change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open in this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Have you done it?"
He was decisive, determined, unambiguous."
The voice of Graham, however, seems to be wall firm.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamics," he said.
"What Dr. Ford is, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has denied it strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one mentioned by her could verify it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday is organised in New York the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up to stars will occur and that a similarly impressive mission is known: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate consciousness for the real purpose: to end extreme poverty for 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international interests managers who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting this.
Concertgoers who wish to receive a free ticket for the event (if they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteers', a world leader emails, conduct a telephone conversation or create other meaningful consciousness for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 years to reach this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to call for action or is this just a different form of 'clicktivism', giving people the feeling that they make a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a twin?
Since 2011, more than 19 million 'actions' have been registered by supporters, aimed at a large number of different objectives, according to Global Citizens.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the efforts of world leaders and have made policy proposals worth more than 37 billion dollars that have to change the lives of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the group quoted 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has been paid or brought together by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained have so far had an impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
One of the most important intentional statements is that of The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and executives from the United Kingdom with the aim of helping 'to achieve their full potential'. This group promised Rwanda 35 million dollars to help end underfood in the country after receiving more than 4.700 seconds from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national authorities and global citizens like you, we can make a footnote of social injustice that is underfood in history," said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 measures were sent in which the British authorities were asked to improve the nutrition situation for mothers and children, the government announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with food intervening.
In response to one of the many questions on the Global Citizen's website, which was asked "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
answered the group, "It will be a long and difficult way, in which we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, like civil rights and anti-party movements before us, we will eventually be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are a few of the artists who will take place this year during the event in New York presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use the marine for a 'blockade' in order to prevent Russian exports of energy - Minister of Home Affairs
Washington can 'if necessary' take refuge to the marine to prevent Russian energy from coming on the market, including in the Middle East, explained Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Minister of Home Affairs, as stated by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country acts on the invitation of the lawful government, is a predestination to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just as in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe," he said, according to the report.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle this.
"The United States has that possibility, with the marine, to ensure that the routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke for invited persons during an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a profitmark that represents itself as the 'move of the energy consumption' in the US.
He continued and compared Washington's approach from Russia with Iran's approach and noted that these were not substantially different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuels," he said and referred to Russia as a country that only knows a 'kunst', with a economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump Government is trying to stimulate the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia, a country that offers the most affordable option for European consumers.
For that reason, representatives of the government of Trump, including President Donald Trump himself, try to convince Germany to withdraw sight from the 'unfit' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum of Berlin, has made Moscow's 'inflicted'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is just a economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the strong opposition of Washington against the project is sent only for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Alexander Novak, Russian Minister for Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Minister, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has triggered a response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The German Industry Federal Association (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, called on the US to avoid interfering with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third power is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federal Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'thinks seriously' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says the Senator for Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts said on Saturday that she'd think of it's serious' to take part in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she thought about it to participate in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means that a woman in the top position," she said, according to the political newspaper The Hill.
"After November 6, I'll think seriously about it to be elected as President."
Warren executes President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said that he "sends this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm up to the bone worried about what Donald Trump brings into our democracy," she said.
Warren has been open in her criticism of Trump and at Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a twoth on Friday Warren said, "Of course we have to wait for a research from the FBI before we vote."
However, a Thursday opinion study showed that a majority of Warren's own claims do not think that it should be preferable in 2020.
Fifty-five percent of the 'probable' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not be elected, according to a policy research study by the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty-third per cent was that she would be preferable.
The research showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent before a possible candidate and 48 per cent.
Other names of leading Democrats associated with possible participation in presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would take an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks of PTSS from Track Palin at a Donald Trump election meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he served in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report on domestic violence Monday night.
"By what my own son needs to experience, what he experiences when he is back, I understand other families who experience the consequences of PTSS and the injuries with which some of our soldiers return," she told the audience who was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they come back a little differently, they come back and get harder, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all other militarymen have given for the homeland".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence and attack on a woman, intervening in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police officer in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the district of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the USA which rejects asylum from victims who are on the flight of violence from bones or from domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. have submitted a statement to the Washington court in support of an asylum seeker who fights this policy last Friday, NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union in August made up against federal policy has not been announced.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people are seeking asylum in the US, as countries who have major problems in the field of bones and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014, which made it possible for immigrants without documents flying from domestic violence to request asylum.
Karl Racine, the CEO of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignores state, federal and international legislation for decades".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such a obstacle is contrary to that principle" in the statement of the 'friend-of-the- Court'.
Advocates further argue that the policy which denies immigrants access to the US is harmful to the US economy, since these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'consider the necessary labour forces'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges not to grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asiel is available for those who escape their country due to persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political belief", said Sessions in its announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asiel was never meant to relieve all the problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people every day get to face all over the world.
Wanhopy rescue efforts in Palu while the number of dead doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became worse and worse.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she tried to comfort her fever in an evacuation centre in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute, new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce."
Inhabitants returned to their ruined homes and searched for valuable things that they could still use in their naughty possessions.
Hundreds of people have suffered injuries and the hospitals are overcome, as far as they are not damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who has broken back and shoulder, rested outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the risk of heavy nascocks.
Throws filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shake the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pressed against the rest of a wall," Haris told a correspondent of the Associated Press and added to this when he was with his family in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
Ambassador of the United States accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda advertisements'
One week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page advertisement in an American newspaper, in which the mutual advantages of trade between the US and China were proclaimed, the US ambassador in China Beijing accused of the use of the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last to the paid annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of interference in the U.S. Congress elections of 6 November, an accusation denied by China.
Trumps accusation that Beijing tried to intervene with the elections in the US, marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in a escalating campaign by Washington to put China under pressure.
Although it is normal for foreign authorities to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an increasing trade war, in which they have increasingly increased import rates.
China's reimbursement rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states like Iowa, who support the Republican Party of Trump, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador in China and formerly Governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
"China," as Branstad wrote in an opinion in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "double the intimidation now by publishing propaganda advertisements in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses the freedom of expression and a free press, a long-loved tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, with a kiosk in the centre of Beijing, you will find in vain deviating votes and you will not see any real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese population may have on the difficult economic path, because the media are firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article," as he did not say to which newspaper this was.
By the Kavanaugh debuction, the Republics dismiss women's electors just before the interim elections, warn analists
Now that many important Republicans are around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him against various accusations of sexual violence, analyticals warn that they will be relapsed, especially among women, during the coming interim elections.
The emotions of this subject have been enormous and most of the Republicans have already told that they want to continue with the vote.
"These things cannot be turned back," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics to the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he wondered whether the attempt of senator Jeff Flake (Republic, Arizona) to plead for a FBI research at the last moment would be sufficient to satisfy the evil electorate.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday, they have not forgotten it tomorrow and they have not forgotten it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday according to the newspaper from Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, demonstrators called "November arrives!" during their demonstration in the Senate hall while the Republicans who have controlled the Justice Committee chose to approve the candidateship of Kavanaugh, despite the witness of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," told Stu Rothenberg, an unpartial political analist, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
However, it can continue, especially among sweeping female electorates in the outside and among younger electorates, from 18 to 29 years, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the President."
Even for the public testimony of Ford, in which they further explained its accusation of sexual intimidation against the applicant to the High Court, analysts suggested that a relapse could be followed if the Republicans were to express the appointment.
"This has become a confused ruin for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republic, earlier last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote in the committee, or about the final vote or Kavanaugh taking place in the court, but it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it" makes Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to be elected by Democrats, clear to the news channel.
However, the Americans appear to be divided about the question who they believe after the witnesses of Ford and Kavanaugh, where a small majority stands in front of the latter.
A new opinion study by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents are surely or probably believe in Ford's witness and that 35% surely or probably believes Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh had definitely lied during his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After the presidency of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges of Ford and of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford said last week before the Senate’s Committee on Justice that Kavanaugh had attacked her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court has shown her his genitals during a festival during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plants a new internet to handle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology-leading, is a company based on the open source platform Solid of Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the possibility to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world rule' is the leading thought behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historical moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to make their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
In this lists of contacts, activity lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be stored.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together via one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it is completely dependent on the user who has access to any information.
The company calls this 'personal employee by means of data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to CEO John Bruce, that the company provides the resources, processes and necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not going to talk with "Facebook and Google about whether or not introducing a complete transformation, which will put all their business models on their head in a single time".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he set up the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an impressive voice in the debate on net neutrality.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredible optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: clergy and dragon of Victoria Cross from WO I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a military is honored in his birthplace 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, the honorable Bernard Vann received the distinction following the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sharp shooter, so he never knew that he had been a part of the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed by his two small sons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the small sons, Michael Vann, said it was 'briliant symbolic' that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant-kolonel Vann led his bataljon on September 29, 1918, on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mist and under heavy fire of field shooting and machine guns".
He later stormed to the fireline and led the line forward before he only ran to a field shooting and switched out three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant-kolonel Vann was killed by a German sharp shooter on October 4, 1918, a little more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can't do it, but also something that makes me feel humble."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid another crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he felt very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the braveness of a real hero shows the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you have been awake all night to see a full-road Bellator 206 and you will not see the most important moment.
At the San Jose pitch, 13 battles were listed, including six in the main section, and this was sent all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the moment Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised when the sender switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had been awake all night for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the child program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"In accordance with the regulations of the government, after 6:00 a.m., no content that is not suitable for children should be displayed, so we had to switch to the child program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcasting.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Scott Coker, business president of Bellator, said that they are going to adapt their programming to ensure that the viewers in the United Kingdom have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the back competition, that we can solve this problem," said Coker.
"But it's six hours in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were many SMSs going and again and believe me, these weren't all as friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that wasn't the case, it was a public problem.
I can promise that this will not happen second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we used to do, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual nature
The Olympic cleaner Tom Daley says he felt inferior during his youth because of his sexual nature, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to the education, he did not realize that 'not everyone is like me.'
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne he said he had spoken about homo rights to give others 'hope'.
He also said that parenthood had contributed to his lower value in winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-term show has taken off a few months due to disease.
Apparently as a shift to Laverne's first program, Daley told him that during his youth he felt 'minder' than others because it was 'no socially accepted to enjoy both girls and boys'.
He said: "To this day these feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was 'one', so he would not disappoint people if they finally found out of his nature.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become an outstanding campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence in the Community games in Australia this year to call more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he was pronounced because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give 'hope' to others.
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he was in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, who he met in 2013, has surprised me completely.
Daley married the Oscarwinner last year, who is 20 years older than he, but said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to endure so much," he took part in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find someone in your own age group who experienced the same height and lowest points.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "full perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a golden medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning golden Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already received the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there anymore to sit on the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stuck and he died, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed about this all my life. To diving for a home public during the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musical choice, Proud by Heather Small, that had strongly attacked him on his way to the games and from which he still got chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is listening to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match in the Ryder Cup, but he must see his form back to not make a sad milestone of it.
Mickelson, who participates in the two-year event, a record, was placed on the bank by the team captain Jim Furik for the four-balls and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of standing in the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and exercising in the driving range, in an attempt to find out where it suspends.
Because he was never known for his right drives even on the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the robbing balls routinely penalizes.
And if the job on itself is not awkward enough, Mickelson in the ninth match on Sunday comes the always accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to new man Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans standing behind four points at the beginning of the 12 single matches, well start, the match of Mickelson can be absolutely critical.
Furik has proved to have confidence in this man, even though he could be honestly difficult different.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a lap on the back, hit his arm around me and said he was ready tomorrow," said Furik.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I had expected more of it, but it's like it is and it's the way we were supposed to act.
He wants to be there, like all the others."
Mickelson can improve the record of Nick Faldo for the highest number of played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never fully respected the peaks of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games standing on his name, but Furik said that his presence had some unresponsive influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's taken, he likes to get rid of jokes with people and he's a great guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to keep him crazy sometimes last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advance can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable precedence prior to the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily cover in a less comfortable situation.
The Deen made his debut in the game in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with as captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point front jump on the Americans, but finally the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great precursor in Valderrama; we had a great precursor in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just," said Bjorn, called here, after he had seen the lighting of 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, well for a precursor of 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not a game yet.
Everyone will have to take full action tomorrow.
Go ahead and carry out the plan right.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is the winning of this trophy, and we need to keep focusing on it.
I continue to say, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Beautiful about the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead with the business in this area.
Tomorrow's a new challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual performances are taking place, and that is another very different discipline.
It's great to be working out there with a partner when it's okay, but when you're alone, your capabilities as a golfer are only really tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he also needs to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform more individually than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who conquered three of the four points.
Furik himself has experience with both sides of this kind of turnover on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every fucking word of that speech," he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or as in Medinah.
When we have the momentum, there's a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have voted our line-up on this and sent the men on the way in the order that we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try to magic something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to guide the counterpublic and put in Rory McIlroy for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," said Bjorn of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany re-established
The latest fregat of the German marine should have served in 2014, in replacing the aged warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and upcoming costs, reported local media.
The operation of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the leading ship in the gloed new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregatten, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper The Time quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the marine in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have occupied the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Marine in 2007 shall replace the aged fregates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful canon, a series of air guns and anti-ship missiles and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to put the latest fregates up to two years, far from home ports.
The constant delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already aged by the time they are in operation, notes The Time.
The fatal fregat F125 has taken the newspaper heads last year, when the German Marine officially refused to put the vessel into operation and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the marine ship sent back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it would be incorporated into a battle mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 seamen, half the manpower on the fregats of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is burdenless of a serious overweight, which will reduce the performance and limit the marine capabilities to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tonnes, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the full project, including the training of the crew, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a deviating €3.1 billion compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregates in their grips become particularly important because of recent warnings that the power of the German marine is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Parliamentary Defence Committee in Germany, recognised that the marine has in fact "a shortage of inertable ships".
The official said that the problem of the time as a snowball has grown, because old ships were removed from business but no substitute vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the fregates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were available to be included in the marine.
National Trust listens to the secret life of flare mice
New research carried out on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to reveal how flare mice use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will bring new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland follows the ordinary and small dwarf wheat mouse, the brown large ear Mouse and the water wing mouse at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed on key locations around the estate to follow the activities of the flare mice throughout the season.
Workers of the NTS and volunteers are also going to conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the scratches of the flare Mouse and what kind of thing does.
A map of the habitat and a report will then be produced to make a detailed image of their behaviour on the landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Adviser, hopes that the results show which areas of the habitat are most important for wing mice and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of pastures and how to maintain the forests the best for birds and similar species.
Vleermus populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have decreased considerably in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities affecting sleeping places and the loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lightsems can also pose a risk, such as flyers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by house cats.
Fleezing Mouses are not really blind.
By their nightly hunting habits, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and barriers in their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares on land in the country, are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, carry out inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue actions.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reservoir for flare mice in Scotland at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of flare muise in Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the estate is the ideal area for the flare mice.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for wing mice," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much not yet known about wing mice, so the work we do here and in other locations will help us to understand better what they need to be able to thive."
He emphasizes the importance of control of wing mice before maintenance work is carried out, as the potential unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female wing mice and their boys, which may cause an entire local population to be eradicated.
Flare Mouses are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall in trouble or to disturb them or to destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to make a contribution to help.
She said: "We still have to learn a lot about our flare Mouses and of many of our species we simply don't know how to deal with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects accusations of assault while his lawyers are ready to persecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo accusations of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people want to 'promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to complain to the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the charges were published.
The tip of Portugal and Juventus is accused of the attack of an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
In addition, he is accused of paying her $375,000 to shut up about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
Via a video for his 142 million followers at Instagram Live called Ronaldo, 33, several hours after the accusations were reported, the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the field.
I am a happy man, and by all means" the footballer added, smiling.
The lawyers of Ronaldo prepare a case in which they want to persecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they called 'a unacceptable reporting of suspects in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants to compensate for the 'moral damage to a amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The suspicious incident was reportedly held in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meetings in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, went back to the room of the footballer, where he, according to the accusation, raped her analyzed, as read in the charge submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the supposed incident Ronaldo fell on his knees and that he told her that he was '99 per cent' a 'good guy', but that he is sometimes abandoned that 'one per cent'.
The documents say that Ronaldo confirms that the few had sex, but that it was mutually accepted.
Mayorga also claims that she has gone to the police and that photos have been made of her injuries in a hospital, but that she has later agreed to an out-of-law arrangement because she was 'bang for the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says that she wants to make the scheme invalid because it has been permanently traumatized by the supposed incident.
Ronaldo was on the point of going from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the presumed assault and this summer went to the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth $100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom 'will have regreted it forever' as car producers leave
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its status as world leader in car production after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was 'cautious' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain would leave the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily suspend production in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese automotive producer said that the impact of delays at the border would be cost in the case of non-deal Brexit jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if Great Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see the production in our factory suspend," said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also revealed their fears about the consequences of a EU-wide departure without agreement for the operation of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already shown that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the case of no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on the basis of the 'just-in-time' principle, where there are 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there may be disturbances at the limits that, according to industry, can lead to delays and shortages of components.
Toyota can not store more than one day in the factory in Derbyshire, as the company informed, and therefore the production would be suspended.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was 'defined in order to avoid those controls at the border'.
"We need to have a deal. We want the best deal that will enable us not only to continue the current success, but also to grab this opportunity," he told the listeners of the Today programme of BBC Radio 4'.
"The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be absolutely able to continue with these very successful set of delivery chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be suspended, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, who is a representative of the Unite trade unions at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs have been lost, they will never come back again.
A public spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting of Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House.
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and the adjunct-procureur-General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed 'and another week' while the fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of elections, links between assistants of Trump and Russia and possible obstacles to the courtship by the President.
The question whether Trump is going to dispose of the adjunct-procureur-general and thus putting Mueller's independence in danger, the Washington rodent machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to establish conversations with Trump and to put the president off through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumours made the round that he was about to serve his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted to 'n' Rosenstein 'not love', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing of the Senate's Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual wrongdoing, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would witness.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to carry out a week's investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the full Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the per captain of Trump, appeared on Fox News.
Asking for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed a week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always want to keep the press informed."
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders have not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scarceness of press conferences was not caused by a resentment of the 'attentive' TV journalists, although, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President does more question-and-response sessions than any president for him," she said, without proofing, "We have viewed the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that much and you've seen us often do that over the last few weeks and that'll take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences with the President alone are rare.
In New York this week, the president could demonstrate why, he made an open-hearted and sometimes bizarre appearance to the collected reporters.
Minister for Health and Health writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the wish that they continue to work at the NHS after the Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter of less than six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish authorities have already declared themselves willing to pay the costs of applying for a fixed status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued during the summer, and this autumn will take the expected decisions.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also suspended the preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I should like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Collegas from all over the EU and outside provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and offer benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is firm and surely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing a speed surgery after head injury
The line baker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, undergone a speed operation yesterday after he had a major injury in the game of Vanderbilt Commodores with 31-27, Mike Organ of the Tennessean reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the side line, and fell there little or more," said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the side line before they put him on a stretcher and took him for further research.
A member of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operation room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are no details about the type/ extent of the injury' and Tennessee State trying to find out when the injury has occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is at Tennessee State after a transfer of Illinois in his first season.
He was totally ticked on Saturday five times before leaving the field, which made him a total of 18 times in this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher emptys when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher vacancies when buying a house in the UK and using the income to help the homes according to new plans of the Conservatives
This action will need to neutralise the success of Corbyn to attract young voters
The increase in emptys shall be charged to persons who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects this to increase £ 120 million a year to help the daklos
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher emptys when they buy a house in the UK and the extra income is used to help the daklos, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn that attracts young electorates with promises to provide more affordable homes and to tell them about many earners.
The increase in the vacuums is raised to persons and companies who do not pay tax in the UK, in which the extra income is paid in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The remuneration, which comes above the current emptys, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for the rental, may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this to raise up to £ 120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the United States, which drives the prices and it is difficult for starters to get a foot on the house ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside the country.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the emptys to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping the prices high by buying land and not using this, and he called on May to remove quotas on affordable houses in order to restore the 'causes' in Britain.
Corbyn announced an outstanding series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to exposition 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister in restoring the 'British Dream', that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective home market needs to be restored.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as simple for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign businesses to buy homes here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of having a house has ever become an too vague dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head is already too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it's his ultimate ambition to ever become manager of Scotland.
The Schott, 42, enjoys the challenge of resurrecting the club from the northeast of England, currently on the third place in League One, at three points from the first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after the last season of St Mirren returned to the Scottish Premiership.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play before my homeland.
But I was selected for the B-team and with this the kous was off" Ross told Sports Sound at BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw playing with my father Scotland often in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps on attracting me.
However, this option would only come if I was successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says that he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a large club, before he had refused to advance Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Succes for me is now measured by 'Can I make this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and the facilities at this club, this should certainly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It's not a simple job to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years working on his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of degradation to win the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a crosspoint" he remembered the moment he took over the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did well well, I deserved fairly well and I knew some reasonable highlights.
But footballs can be heavy.
There's a lot of things you're faced with every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the trade, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I'm real, I'm so good in my skin, as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The heat wave in the summer has made the income increases from British pubs who have difficulty to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw the turnover rise by 2.7 per cent in July, but the incomes in restaurants were 4.8 per cent less, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business advisory agency, who collected the figures, said: "Continuous sunshine and the fact that England was more than expected to participate in the world championships, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had changed 2.8 per cent more, with that difference that the restaurants were now even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in the turnover of restaurants in June, only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that are focused on drinking did well, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that restaurants went down.
Pubs that are also focused on the sale of food also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It looks like people only went out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, drinking sales were 6.6 per cent higher for the month, while food sales was 3 per cent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, analyzer for the free-time and hospitality industry, said: "This results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remains the main factors for turnover in the outdoor market.
It is therefore not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight, although a turnover of 4.8 per cent of the year is particularly painful in view of the continual cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have arrived at a worse moment for the operators who focus on food and only the time will learn or the more moderate temperatures of August can give the necessary refreshment."
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, which reflects the decrease in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the Pub, Bar and Restaurant sector in the UK, the performance data are collected and analysed from 47 operational groups, with a shared turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One out of five children has a secret account for social media that they keep hidden from their parents
One out of five children, a few not older than 11 years old, has a secret account for social media, which keeps them hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey among 20,000 students from middle schools revealed the growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted
Twenty percent of the students say to have a head account that they also show their parents
One out of five children, a few not older than 11 years old, makes accounts for social media that keep them hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students from middle schools revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta-accounts', a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content is posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'head account' that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who came to the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter at chance discovered a teenager who asked others to 'rape' her.
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Headmistresses) of independent schools discovered that 40% of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half of them had to keep personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are enticed to create online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Eilidh Doyle becomes the ' voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for the athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Council of the Scottish athletics world, as non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the management body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great chance for the drivers of sport to learn from its extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the Skotland, the UK and the world's athletic community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election in the Council," said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am glad to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can make a contribution and help steering sports in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 meters and 400 meters during the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four golden Olympic Medal, and now regularly commenting on the BBC, could not walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will learn or I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terrible hard work, but I have been fully recovered now, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support statements!"
Advertising for breast pump in which mothers are compared with cows, distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an advertisement in which sowing mothers are compared to cows that are molten.
In order to highlight the introduction of what is called the 'the quietest portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, producer of consumer technology, has issued an ironic, on music videos inspired ad to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to collaborative mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled shoe on a song that contains texts like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything about it' and 'If you didn't watch it, these are no eggs, these are my breasts'.
The refrigeration then continues with: 'Pomps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's'.
However, the ad, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, has directly ensured an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has exposed hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that the 'horror' of the dairy industry is acceptable.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
As we do, they have to be expected to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days after the birth" is written in a reaction.
The breast pump of Elvie fits discreetly in a nutrition beha (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else said: "This is naturally traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another one added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song "Hilaric".
"I think this is a genial idea.
I would buy one if I still breastfeeded.
That pump gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a genial product," someone wrote.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, directed to mothers who are cows (vaken in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like they're just "coating".
This advertisement is not at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreet hidden in their beha's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who cows sometimes feel just cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly in a nutrient, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on bullets.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a strong and provocative introduction.
By making a comparison between coaling mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the bullets and the associated challenges in the lighters and at the same time show in an inconsistent and understandable way how the new pump will ensure an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time the pump of Elvie gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski's catwalk while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has reached a peak, although the number of monthly cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the hard-footed retoric and the hard-fed policies introduced by the Trump Government make it more difficult to bring children to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to risk their own chance of staying in the country by registering for a child.
This risk has increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their households should give their fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declared in a witness to the convention that his organization has arrested tens of people who have registered as sponsor for unleashed minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had no preliminary penalty.
"Because 80% of those who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and most of them are criminal strangers.
We are persecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules, which implies that some of them are obliged to appear for the court within one month after the initiation of the detention, instead of within 60 days, which was earlier the standard, according to the staff at the shelter
Many of them will be for the court through a video conference, instead of personally, to address their application of a legal status for an immigrant.
Those who are considered to be not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children stay close, the greater the chance of getting anxious or depressive, which may lead to violent outbreaks or flight attempts, according to employees at the shelter and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is fighting are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for this, or to quit friends, can contribute to the trauma that many of them have already struggled with.
Syria commands the U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
In a speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return even when the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, also vice-president, said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the preliminary ruling of terrorism, and that 'it will be done accordingly.'
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been decommitted and driven away from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian areas" from terrorist groups and from an "eventual illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, especially in training and advising the Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabians who fight against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the country that war is scattered.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are favourable for their return and he said "to spread some Western countries of irrational fears" and that most refugees remain away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They politicians are a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there is no reconstruction aid available for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The United Nations diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last important balloon of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political discussions.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has turned away a large ship attack from Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem emphasized that this agreement knows 'clare deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front connected to Al-Qaeda, which 'will be eradicated'.
Staffan de Mistura, Member of the United Nations, hopes to gather the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to design a Constitution for Syria after the war and to encourage elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions of the Syrian Government to participate in the committee and said that the panel's work should restrict itself to 'revision of the articles of the present constitution' and warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second time
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, his presidency is prematurely terminated by a settlement procedure and scandals.
In what undoubtedly would be 'the most dramatic final of a presidentship ever'.
At present, however, there are no signs of spectacular fatigue.
Since 2014, the views during the 'prime time' at CNN have been more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost threefolded to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and 'The Rachel Maddow Show' of MSNBC stands at the top of the ratings for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers in the evenings with important news.
"This is a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, the responsible behind the ABC Drama 'Designated Survivor' a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She remembers a taxirit in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Cause he makes me laugh'," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, in contrast to all the others on TV, the storylines coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or decide whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's going beyond a well-informed citizen, when you're watching you've been sitting for six hours looking at a panel experts who discuss the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which talks about the jacket of Paul Manafort's jacket that cost $15,000 ('a clothing full of overmoed', according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
In any case, I will never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show, is partly that he's putting you something new every evening," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the maker of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating role division of the Trump show and the daily plot exchanges (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praises).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea you're walking behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside to look at MSNBC while he took CNN.
He could not get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh who had to appear before the Senate's Court and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember that we did all those strange shows, not so long ago, and that people said, "This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now they were right."

Outside money flows in the most exciting intermediate elections for the House of Delegates
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania district sees a flood of money, thanks to a reconstruction of a electoral district which has to fight two sitting national representatives for the same seat.
The newly divided district of Pittsburg meets the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must take it against another sitting national representative, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which knows a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The cards were re-classified after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January considered that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified (‘gerrymanding’) in the benefit of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a collapse party in the field of campaign financing between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Demokratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (NRCC) (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory in a well-viewed special election for the 18th Pennsylvania electoral district.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than ten years, and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. considered to punish El Salvador for support to China and had failed to do so.
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognised and had not received a negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until his partners suspended the Trump Organization's management team.
Officers of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs have decided to withdraw the U.S. Heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama from the 'recent decision not to recognize Taiwan no longer' said Heather Nauert, the ministerial spokesman, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only punishments were considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $ 140 million of US aid in 2017, for control of drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with a high unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials posted a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in attempting to prevent migrants moving to the United States.
However, half September some of the government's top officials told them that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible penalties against El Salvador impossible.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence has a speech at the conference, which is now planned for half October, as a sign of the importance that the government has given to the meeting, says diplomats.
And the three American messengers have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any more intentions, without strong messages about Washington's criminal measures.
A spokesman of the White House, on behalf of Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who was also close to the government and who spoke on the basis of anonymity.
Study History
The following step may be the report by special prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counteract of Trump's justice, which has now become public.
Mueller will probably also focus on collaboration between the Trump campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress changed color, Trump must be responsible for that institution, just as he is ready to redirect himself to the voters, and perhaps he must be responsible for a jury in a court.
That is a lot of ideas, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor those of its equivalents in Europe.
We all, on both sides of the Atlantic, will have to make choices, which will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938 German officers were ready to perform a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had been resisting and Czechoslovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and thereby missed an opportunity to avoid the years of blood shedding, which followed.
The course of history is circumventing such curve points, and this accelerates or slows down the independence of democracy.
Americans are currently faced with various of this kind of buoyal points.
What will we do if Trump rides adjunct-procureur General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the time when this magazine reported that last year he had suggested to take up conversations with the President in secret and that he had speculated about the President's suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not right.
"How will we react if the new requested investigation from the FBI to Brett Kavanaugh is not fully or unfair, or if he is appointed at the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of assault and unfair witness?
And above all, will we vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will call Trump for responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail by the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech jodin who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever occupied my ambassador residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me away, 60 years later, to pitch lights before the Sabbath on that table on which a swastika was represented.
With that as my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Vienna
Rangers get Rapid Vienna to visit on Thursday and know that after the impressive equality in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, a victory of Austrians will put them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europe League.
Due to a kneeblessure, Graham Dorrans couldn't play his first match from the season until the 2-2 match at Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use these results as a spring plank for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good elevental," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game with the idea that something was to win and the game came out with a point.
Maybe we could even have won at the end, but over the whole game, a equal game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
The coming Thursday is a new big European evening.
Hopefully we can reach three points but it will be a difficult match because they also had a good result in their last match, but if the public is going to stand behind us, I am sure that we can press through and we can achieve a positive result.
Last year has certainly been heavy, of everything that happened to my blessures and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a sense-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully we can now press, leave the last season behind us and get successful again."
Women cannot sleep due to fear of their pension
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the research of Nationwide said they were talking to their wives about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they do not take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
Let's start here.
Talk to your husband and children: You can't prepare your family for care if you don't know your wishes well in time.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial adviser in the arm: Your adviser can also give you advice on how to pay these expenditure.
Your long-term long-term financing choices can include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenditure, or to invest your own assets as insurance, as long as you have money.
Set up your legal documents: Avoid legal struggle when the insurance needs to be incorporated.
Make sure you have full power for health care, so that you can designate a trusted person who can review your medical care and ensure that professionals keep your wishes in case you can't communicate anymore.
Consider also a full power for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on behalf of you and to make sure that the invoices are paid if you can no longer.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine your elderly father or mother finds a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies in that case?
Put these details in a written plan, so you can get the information in hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that are important, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who cares for the dog?
Make sure that plan is coming."
Man shot several times with air pressure gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot with a air pressure gun several times when he walked home after a night.
The victim, 40 plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, abdomen and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'random act'.
The victim hasn't seen who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city Palu on Friday, said officials, and the expectation is that the number of deaths will continue to rise.
As the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the government of Donggala, a northern Palu area which is closer to the epicenter of the population with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central-Celebes and is at the end of a small Bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated his 40th birthday when the tsunami joined.
Donggala is a rainfall that stretches over 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The government, a administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299.900 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main activities in the central-Celebes province, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly affected by tsunamis in the last hundred years according to the Agency for the fight against disasters of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami demanded more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also joined in the west of Donggala in 1996, with nine dead.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh on northern Sumatra on December 26 saw a tsunami that had hit 14 countries and took 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Atjeh.
2005: A series of heavy earthquakes took place on the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with a force of 6.8 on the scale of Richter took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that swept on the south coast and demanded almost 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a force of 7.6 on the scale of Richter hit the city Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people found death.
2010: A earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the scale of Richter hit one of the Mentawai islands, on the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed decades of villages and demanded about 300 human lives.
2016: An indepth earthquake hit Pidie in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destruction of the deathful earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami followed, but more than 100 people found death by decaying buildings.
2018: Multiple earthquakes found the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and ensured that thousands of tourists were temporarily scattered.
Oldest son of Sarah Palin arrested in charge of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-Presidentship, was arrested for the charge of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, infringement of a report of domestic violence and resistance during the judgment, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman's acquaintance tried to call the police to report the claimed mistake, he took off the phone from her.
Palin is held in the house of conservation Mat-Su with a treasury of $500, reported KTUU.
He appeared to the judge on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, surely know" when he was asked for this, the network reported.
Palin is accused of three violations of class A, which means that he can be sentenced to one year in prison and to a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a violation of class B, which is criminal with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is accused of criminal facts.
In December 2017 he was accused of mistreating his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the supposed abuse.
This case is now for the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was accused of an abuse in the home atmosphere, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon influenced by the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group in 2016 after she had linked her son's violent behavior to PTSS, which he would have left to his service time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 have died after a earthquake met the Indonesian island Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake with a force of 7.5 on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been disabled while the expectation is that the number of deaths will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the center of Celebes, located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are circular videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York claim the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight persons have been killed, a rare punishment that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, according to the charge, used a hired truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he rided walkers and cyclists who came on his path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov's deliberately killed the eight victims and intentionally caused serious physical injuries, according to the intention declaration in which the death penalty is required, which has been submitted in the Southern District of New York.
In both cases, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the Court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the tenlasting with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and described the way Sajpov executed the attack as 'great, cruel and corrupt'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitch Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the intentional statement.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years ago that in the Southern District of New York there was a case in which the death penalty was required.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to lifelong prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after two years earlier sentenced for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, coming from Uzbekistan, did not show resentment in the days and months after the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the detectives that he felt good about his act, she's the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after viewing ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, told the police.
He did not claim to be guilty of the charges with 22.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he's 'naturally disappointed' with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We think that the decision to claim the death penalty instead of accepting a guilt in exchange for a lifelong prison sentence without the possibility of freezing will only extend the trauma of these events for all those involved," said Patton.
The Defense of Sajpov had earlier asked the prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today to mobilise a "voluntary leader" during a protest at the Conservative Party Conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that the politicians should feel the 'heart' of the Eurosceptists, while one of the own members of Theresa May proposed to give him the leadership of negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants on March in Birmingham that the UK would already be out if Mr. Farage Brexit had been Minister.
But the challenge that May faces in reconciliation of the strongly divided lines is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the ride while this is attacked by Brexiteers, Remains and the EU.
Competitioners persisted that she would continue and will try to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the oppositions, and thus force Euroscepticis and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted 'Chequers to throw in the rollerman'.
He proposed that the Farage should be ranked and that the responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels should be given.
"If he finished the service, we would be out of it now," said Bone.
The Member of the House for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers into the garbageman."
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be underlying.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone pointed out suggestions that the public opinion had been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British population has changed its opinion and wishes to remain in the EU is completely false."
The conservative Brexite Andrea Jenkyns also participated in March and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular to the public, the opposition does not vote for, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and ensure that we are elected.
Let Chequers fall and listen."
In a direct message for May, she added: "Premiers keep their job when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'heart' if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to say, "We don't let you get away with this."
In a message to the enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to put the fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilise the national army of this country that has brought us the victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Remains marched by Birmingham and concluded this March with a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A small group of activists sweared with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the establishment of this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, member of the Supreme House for Labour, was joking about the security problems of a party app of the Conservatives at the beginning of their conference.
"This is the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all technologies for Canada plus, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a full farce.
There's nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plants 'to think well' about the candidateship
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the elections in November, she will be going to think well about her candidateship for the presidentship.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrate from Massachusetts told about her future during a meeting in a town hall in the west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican deputy who was the co-chairman of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been the center of speculations that it might be going on the fight with Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
One present asked her if she would be preferable to the presidency.
Warren answers that it's time for women to go to Washington to recover our defective government and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrest after shooting Wayde Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the death of Wayde Sims, basketball player of LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a ET press conference at 11:00 p.m.
They released a video from the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a shot wound in his head and died of its consequences," said police officer Murphy J. Paul to the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has known to have been present in the place of delict, in possession of a gun and Wayde Sims shot.
Simpson is arrested without further incidents and is arrested in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 1.98 metres Junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started the last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per race.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory after orders of team
When Valtteri Bottas graduated before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and almost left Hamilton in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fetttel entered the piss and left Hamilton in the pushed drives in the stairs of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in a round later the pits and came out behind the fattel, but Hamilton came back on the head after a wheel-on-cycle action, allowing the Ferrari rider to free space on the inside after a double movement in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21th birthday.
He was then a leader of the race for a time, because he stayed with his band choice, and licked on fast finish, so he could pick up Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round he went to the piss, after he couldn't increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen was celebrated.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me away.
The team did its best for the places one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a sitting meeting on Saturday on the fact that she persisted not to be the source of the written letter by Christine Blasey Ford, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
At an election meeting in West-Virginia, the President did not speak directly about the witness given by Ford to the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he informed that something took place in the Senate showed that people could be 'gemenged, unlikely and unlikely'."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and unlikely and unlikely," he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and that they then say, "Oh, I haven't done it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you learn?
You remember her answer... did you read the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
He added to this, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the charges to the address of Kavanaugh were mentioned was sent to Feinstein and sent by Ford in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was leaking.
"I didn't keep Dr. Ford's accusations hidden, I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me confidently to go, and I treated it confidential, as she had asked."
But the president did not believe her denial and he commented on it at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, that was not a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In addition to his defense of the applicant for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the President suggested that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take the power back, with all the necessary means.
You see the commonness, the unpleasantness, they don't care about who they hurt, who they should drive to take the power and get the control back," said the president, according to a report by the Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars has recovered the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return competition with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scores.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team along before Dwyer brought the Giants back to direction.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Luke Lundvald Nielsen made the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who on Friday evening had to make a backstand to hit Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three matches.
The opening hall of Dwyer came at a assist from Kendall McFaull in the fourth minute at 3:35. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the front, four minutes later.
In a pressed opening period, Sullivan returned the home ploy to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the forehead for the equalizer of Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants entered the first rest with a precursor, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team repacked and Bouchard brought them back to an equal position with a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the race, late in the second period. He provided the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic leader dies while he ensures that hundreds can escape the earthquake in a plane
An air traffic leader in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he ensured that a plane with hundreds of people could rise safely on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; a earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Strong aftershoes still harass the area and many have been buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-way and again moving roadstores of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained to ensure that flight 6321 from Batik Air, who was ready at the time on the start track, could get up safely.
He was then expelled out of the roadstore when he thought it was coming up.
He died in the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of deaths can rise to the thousands of people and told the Agency to combat disasters in the country that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"Man assumes that the number of deaths is still rising because many bodies were under the ruin and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the Agency.
Wells reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a massive funeral feast will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and stocks.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is developed in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they will happen.
This is already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday, and he said to the present military: "I call on you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks necessary for evacuation.
Are you ready?" Reported CNN.
Indonesia was already affected by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagune.
The airline that carried out the flight that was crashed in a pacifical lagune in Micronesia now says that one more man is missing after they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had left the sunk plane safely.
Air Niugini said in a press release that is missing one male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked together with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to the requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane had been overwhelmed during the landing on the airport of the Chuuk Islands.
The authorities announced on Friday that seven people had been brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that the condition of everyone was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of the events, remains preliminaryly unclear.
The airline and the U.S. marine both say that the plane has landed in the lagune and the landing course has missed.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot over the landing track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told him that he himself and some others managed to walk through the water that came to their midst to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewards were in panic and screaming and that he had a not serious headache.
The U.S. mariner announced that sealing in nearby work on a yard has also helped the rescue work by bringing people to the coast with a blastable boat before the plane fell further into the about 30 metres deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that in the last 20 years, 111 persons have found death in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG, but none of them relates to Air Niugini.
Analist determines the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The accuser closed his requisitoir on Friday in the reopening process of a man accused of the alive burning of a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analist of the US Ministry of Justice, carried out a few hours of witness as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear for the jury how he had used the phone call data to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left life.
Rowlett told him that he had received the location data from various mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his mobile phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to Sanford.
Sanford was in the witness bank on Saturday and told him he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis spoke the truth when he told me he was in his truck at Sanford during the night, Sanford said he'd've lied because my truck was in Nashville then.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
The mobile phone data indicated that they only knew each other one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis knew the texts, calls and contact details of his phone some time after the death of Chambers.
"He knew her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense starts on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to start the discussions later that day.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hiphop'?
A hiphoptrio wants to discuss the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol suggests that hiphop is distinguished from the origin of political opinions and to address social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hiphop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced another survival in Great Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A young lady from New York will give a couple to the judge because of a 'racist' text
A child boyfriend from New York has given a couple to the judge because of dismissal for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrongly sent text in which the mother was complaining about 'and so black'.
The couple denies racist and calls the case 'expression'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her disappointment when she discovered that the new child girl, Giselle Maurice, was a negroide woman when she met her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEE WAS TO'N ZWARTE," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it only twice to Mrs Maurice.
According to the U.S. newspaper New York Post, the Plasco-Flaxman, who felt uncomfortable, was dismissed when she realized her blunder. She explained that her former child boyfriend, who was a Afro-American, had done bad work, and therefore she had expected a Philippines.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice takes the couple for the court to get a compensation of $ 350,- per day for the 6 months for which she was rented to be in the family, even without a contract.
'I want them to feel that you just don't do something like that,' said Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding, 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple bite from themselves with regard to the claim that she is racist by saying that it was reasonable to release Maurice after being offended by her, they were afraid that they could not trust her anymore.
"My wife sent her a message that she wouldn't have sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, said Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was accidentally?
Your newborn baby?
Don't let go.'
Compare the case with 'expressing', Plasco said that his wife expected a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
"Are you going to persecute someone like that?
This is not so sympathy, added the investment banker.
While the case is still in progress, the public opinion is quick to capture the couple on social media, where it is insulted for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a speaking bear, revealed newly opened letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the approval of the book, said about the letter: 'It's hard to stand in the shoes of someone reading it for the first time, still before the first publication.
With what we now know about the huge success of Paddington, it is very easy."
She told her father who, before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, as a cameraman worked at the British broadcaster BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th birthday of the publication of the book 'bitter sweet' felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, which she describes as 'a very prominent member of the family', she told her father was secretly proud of the final success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost looked like a child's performance; you're proud while you didn't do anything for it yourself.
I think he experienced the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own performance power, he honored the bear himself for success."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was brought to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected that she would not get it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad's call came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll be with you again.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly developed and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process further turned off everything.
I could just stay there, knowing what happened.
I couldn't be sorry, crying or crying, because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I really had to keep big."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning about the death of her daughter, walked in the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she had to face.
"Nobody knew it," she said.
"I sat down with my head, and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Roving women put messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide make themselves strong to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys insert inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis, her son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he first became depressive and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and resident in Lydney in the Gloucestershire English County, says that her son was a promising boss cook with an incredible gray.
"He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile lighted every room."
Yet he stopped working for his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014 Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself from life.
Mrs Davis said, 'I am constantly concerned that there is a chain reaction.'
Mrs. Davis made the cards, 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and where you can talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't shut up - talk about it."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt bad or depressive or something like that," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was on the ground on the first Christmas day, when the children packed out their presents, he didn't look at them or something."
She said that his death was a big trauma for them, but that they should handle it: 'It's breaking the whole family apart.
It's driving us out.
But we all have to go on and continue fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertainly while FBI starts research
'I thought that if we were actually able to get what he asked for, a study limited in time and size, we might be able to create some more unity,' said Mr Flake last Saturday, which he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling out of one another, in the middle of a firmly confined patting within the party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican followers not want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been in five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans do bad, their efforts to get their husband chosen in the highest court in the country are seriously difficult.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the US Senate to lobby for Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush, and thus his wife Ashley, who was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has finished the report?
Then there will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Mr Pence, Vice-President, the opportunity to make the decisive vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh for the High Court of Justice.
Number of overruns in North Korea 'defeated' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean overruns has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-sug, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unwording, explains that there were 1.127 overruners last year, compared to 2.706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for human smugglers are the main factors for falling.
Pyongyang hasn't responded publicly.
The vast majority of the overruns from North Korea are finally offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreas have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fleeing through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the severely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreans.
China considers the overruns as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often turns them out with violence.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still formally capable of war, have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries had a meeting in Pyongyang, which spoke mainly of the destructive negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the president of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed largely to work on the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of the lack of progress in the renewal of American sanctions since then.
'Without faith in US trade, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step in unilateral disarmament,' says Mr Ri during a speech for the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysteric' and finds him unqualified to serve in the High Court of Justice
President of the House of Delegates, Nancy Pelosi, referred to as the applicant for the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh 'hysteric' and finds him inadequate to serve at the Court of Justice
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday during the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help to think that if a woman acted like this, it would be called her "hysterical", Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's witness to the Senate Committee on Justice on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the accusations that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very enthusiastic; he at times cried almost and was especially anxious when he told about his family and his schooltime.
He also explicitly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him 'great and coordinated character murder', organized by liberals who were malicious that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh's witness proved that he was not suitable for serving the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and by the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats," says Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether she would try to put an imposing procedure against Kavanaugh if he would be appointed, and the Democrats would receive the majority in the House of Delegates.
"I can say this; if he does not tell the truth in the Congress, or to the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to the Supreme Court, but also to the court where he is now serving," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Tribunal of the District of Columbia (usually abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Beroep.
Pelosi added that as a democratic she was concerned that Kavanaugh would speak against the 'Defordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (the law on payable health care). Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh asked questions about reviewing certain decisions of the High Court of Justice during the hearings of confirmation.
"Don't expect us to be pleased if a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed at the Supreme Court," says Pelosi.
Women just have to admit this.
It's a fair tirade of months and years of croped anger that runs over, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We're going to cry when we get angry," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later to me.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was somewhere guided and who told her that she was going to cry when she got angry. She developed a method, in which she always began to cry when she got angry. To the one with whom she spoke, she said, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on crying.
I just thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partially allowed as expression of anger, because crying is essentially unaware.
One of my best remaining memories from a former job, in a man’s dominated office, is when I had to cry terriblely because I was extremely angry. An older woman, a killing business leader who everyone was a little afraid of, took me into my necklace and slurred me into a stairs house.
"Don't let them see you cry," she said to me.
'They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're happy they got you in the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of the Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidateship for the Presidency.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was developed in an out-of-good affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'cattenwaad' or 'apenstrack') and went back from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she would not make herself a candidate.
"It wasn't a thoughtful decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
'There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snee white and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with fund recruitment, so she promised not to join if she couldn't pay $2 million.
It was a lost fight.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give her $1,000 to men, wanted to give her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude to the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to collect money, and to reach voters instead of Members, and of anger about sexism - that she broke into it.
'There will have been thought that I had a nervous insufficiency,' Mrs Schroeder recalled how the media responded to her.
'They'll have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tomb stone?
"She was crying?"
How the trade war between the US and China can be awarded for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were over-deathing, and although the fight has not yet been long, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be able to take advantage of Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, U.S. President, gave earlier this year the first warning by increasing taxes on important Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation was known this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (150 billion) to goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken in naturala represailles every time, most recently by increasing rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion on American goods.
China has promised to compare the US every time, and the world's in one of the largest economies will probably not blink quickly with the eyes.
In order to make Washington bow, requests must be consented, but public bowling to the US is much too painful to the Chinese president Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the U.S., China could be positive in the longer term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions, which could cause one of the two countries to be in an economic free fall, is really far more dangerous than those who have recognised before,' says Abigail Grace, a research co-worker of the 'Center for a New American Security', a thought tank specialized in national security issues that focus on Asia.
Syria 'clear' to allow refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
During his speech for the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister, Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in his country were improved.
'The situation at present is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,' he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that have been destroyed by terrorists and to normalize the situation at the place.
All the conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures threatening their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have escaped their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are about six million people in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to restore the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept any conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidied the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwest of Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has no longer won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish leader Thomas Bjorn achieved the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the U.S. team, Phil Mickelson, who was almost the whole tournament, left his long battle from the tea in the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shattered in all his rounds and became one of the four players who ever picked up 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by playing the lowest score of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest classed player on the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, which possibly played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so soon, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we've got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said a empowered Garcia after the European victory.
He passes on to his landlord, John Ram, who went into the American legend of Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel because I hit Tiger Woods. I always followed that guy when I grew up," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled the weekend to find the fairways, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at high level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. commander, Jim Furik, said after the disappointing performance of his team, "I am proud of these boys, they have struggled.
Short time this morning, we made Europe a little bit more difficult.
We offered opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great commander.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the US PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud that I can be their leader.
You have to take off your hat for the opponent.
We've been overplayed."
Red gloed update: Concentrations take off in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report by the "Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission" (Florida Commission for Fish and Fauna) shows a general decrease in Red concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay Area ( located on the western coast of Florida in the US).
According to the committee, fragmentary increase in the red gloed is reported in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The Red glow stretches over an average of 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas to the southern Lee counties.
There are about 16 km from the coast of Hillsborough County spots, but at less places than last week.
Red was also seen brightly in Pasco County.
The medium-sized concentrations were reported on the coast of Pinellas County last week, low to high concentrations at the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations at or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations at or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There is a permanent report on airway irritation in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In the northwest of Florida, there was no mention of airway irritation in the last week.
