Munich 1856: Four cards that change your view of the city
An irr-station where youths are to meet today.
A grave chapel, which is now buried for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Climbing gardeners manage the sole ground of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories in days.
It's nervous if cards aren't present.
That knows anyone who had to excit himself before because the car Navi indicated a green grass instead of a walking road.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlase, a offer of the geoportal of Bayern of the state government, are everything other than current - but that is why very intelligible.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of the Munchner Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern atlas is a flickenteppich that you do not recognize as such.
In the large overview map, more detailed cards for cities and communities, so-called urposition sheets, were included.
These originated between 1810 and 1864, according to the Bayerian measuring administration, and originated from the first measurement of Bayern.
Your contractor: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bayern with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical recording of Bayern in order - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was the neighbors today who created the idea of a surface-decking Bayern card.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bayerian measuring administration.
The original positionsheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is found on the website of the Bavarian National Library, like all others.
The comparison in the past/day is the most impressive in the example of the capital of the country.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
One example of this is a transmitter that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sending was incorporated 21 years after drawing the map, i.e. 1877, as the Munchner District.
Today, the submission is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of submissions concentrate around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, nothing is seen as fields - at the first glance: when zooming in, a smaller card appears with dozen lines and numbers: handwritten castles from the so-called "outtake", from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels do not prove farmers there today - but dressing gardeners of the "Land in Sun".
A large green area is characterized north of submission.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 at the October Festival, was actually a grass - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
The Urpositionsblatt reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the height "On the Fans" - but also in large letters "Irre Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeld Street, people were once locked in with crazy ideas.
There was the Munchner Kreis Irrenanstalt "On the Auer ventilen" created 1858/59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Godden led the institution - that psychiater, which is brought into connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was advanced for his time and, for example, ended the chain of the so-called mistakes.
He has also forbidden the staff to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been working for an exhibition with the institution.
The first place was for 280 patients, and then it was extended to 500 places.
This capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Circle Institute in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, there is the Isar-Amper Hospital München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatry in Germany.
At the area of the former Auer Anstalt, youths are now meeting in the Munchner Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it to a youth home with training plants.
West is the football square of the TSV Munich East, eastern residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural reference to the origin of the irrene station, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was recorded as "Haupt Platz", the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
A decisive change in the Second World War also brought into the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the bombs of the Alliances raped many holes into the city of the city.
A big one stayed up to today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval barbecue chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where this day the preparatory work takes place and on April 5, 2017 the spatenstich for the second S-Bahn strap line.
With the slider, you can compare the old Munich map with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens' Rights Group published Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for colorful people traveling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks of the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to the state on travel and to make extreme caution, as a number of questionable, racial events are recently occurring and noted here," says the Group's opinion.
A recent law adopted by Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the state's criminal prosecutors, who target minorities unproportionately, allowed the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"You have violations of citizens' rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are collapsed or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted events such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under doubtful circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no petrol anymore during his journey through the state and was held in guard by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.
The Council also pointed out a recent report from the Office of the General State Attorney of Missouri, showing that black drivers in the state are held 75 percent more frequently than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people need to be ready to bring cautions money or to let the relatives know that they are traveling through the state."
In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI's Hate Crime Reporting Programme, which assessed the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws, obliged local penal prosecutors to arrest people for immigration infringements, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiles.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times interested groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidezaun project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the next year.
The CDU-Bundestag Members Peter White and Kordula Kovac have made a picture on site.
At the Swingenmann family courtyard, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU City Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann gave first insights into his holding, where he manages 55 hectares of wheat and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 milk cows and as many virgin animals and stays in five apartments.
The black milk is for him the optional marketing route for the milk of his cows, so swingman.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also Vice-President of Fischerbach, he referred to the Weidezaun project as "elementary important".
I can't profit in this kind of steep areas.
The greenland area provided a lot of work, many things have to be processed with the motor sensor.
"We have to fight with the conditions and the topography here," stressed Schwendemann.
In 2003 he took over the parental holding and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if it does not operate a bioactivity.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, "The municipality has recognised the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the Leader promotion".
At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the refurbishment of the surfaces could be pulled out for a long time.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to carry on their operation," the mayor stressed.
Agricultural farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels were collected by eleven participants.
The open area is 40 hectares which may not be forested until at least 2023.
The total cost of EUR 71 500 was half-funded via Leader, one quarter of the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of weedzaun.
"The great advantage is the long life of the toes," explained Schwendemann.
Cordula Kovac emphasized: "You do a good job, without farmers and women you can't do it."
Peter White also said: "Here best foods are produced".
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the State to promote weeds.
The goal is to keep the black forest open.
There is a prerequisite for the existence of a promotional culture referred to by the LPR.
In addition, the incumbent area must not be swiftly manageable (a slope of more than 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestry.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcells is currently running, which want to build nearly 16 kilometres of Zaun.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the estimated cost is more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump takes the stand of freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore the carefully scenario of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axt in a hot fight with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President to drastic limit the legal immigration status.
To remain fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
A horn of boat owners and Liberty immitators would have slicked it if he had.
But he attacked their importance, and in particular the significance that was attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base.
When Miller Acosta insulted: "I don't want to go to a complete thing about history here, but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original state of freedom."
Miller is in fact right, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of the upheaval words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tiredness, your poor, / your indignant masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the poor waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "old waste" was better to see on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict of the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who tried to place their words on the basis after their death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a depleted classical representation.
Lazarus changed this significance: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: the mother of the exiles.
The link of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nationalism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people wanted to change this from the right wings for a long time.
The great scream of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the stand of freedom was not invited to anyone but rather a early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the night-to-night world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.
It is to bear the facle of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.
The flare should not illuminate the way to the United States."
Very unusual Limbaugh has been hit at something here.
The importance of the statue is quite a matter of perception.
The great phantatic act of Lazarus consisted in seeing it as it was seen by the fateful, elusive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is in the most true sense about seeing the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome which they must hear.
And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their flash shall not illuminate the way, but inflamme the hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the team of Britain
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two shots belonged to the team of the UK
The performance director of the United Kingdom's light athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the world championship framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "I have to develop something special in Scotland" and the United Kingdom's light athletics have to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," said Black.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British light athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are Medal Advocates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will run against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was unbelievable," says Black.
"A series of athletes, whether they were schotical or wherever they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that the Eilidh naturally introduced were great."
The commonwealth silver medal winner, who will join the 400-m-herds in her fifth world championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 shots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes in the World Championship was seven which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The Middle Course Muir leads on this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another shot that you should watch after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other shot in Lee McConnell team was.
The captain of the team says that they are "enorm proud" to the fact that many of her countrymen are not only members of the team, but in some cases they will also be mixed with the medals and the finals.
"The special thing to be a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes it a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the shots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we came.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to Podies.
What's my speech as Captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympia Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don't care for a public office if you can't tolerate the heating of choosers
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but soon the newspapers struck him for everything, from internal policy to his political principles.
He was sausaged at criticism, safe.
But he didn't bring his critics to silence.
For in 1783 Washington said, "The freedom of speech can be removed - and, stupid and stupid we are led to battle like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him about the beginning of this week.
The Governor's staff released the complaint as freevol, and the online commentary was full of a reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary hitzhead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his choosers and play playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Hence, the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called officially and by employees paying with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and finally dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post Hogan's Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the acts of the governor and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a modest.
But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spams or hated people who swing the peitsche online.
The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hated, but she asked for hate crime.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea even if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then some people are ignored rather than a so-called collective use and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's employees called "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call "pre-language".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much more clean than in the past, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lead articles or to arrest demonstrators and to bring to silence.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official who is criticized for being offended by Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The president of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County infringed the first amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook site.
And in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Portos had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers appealed to his leadership.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used Pseudonyme such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't bring her to silence.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discretion are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoped for domestic comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lotian organizes the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led next to the Archerfield Links last year to the end round before he lost against Paul Eales, is connected to the new poster and acts as a tournament messenger on behalf of the association founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he reaches his glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry made a great job when he fixed this place.
He is a zealous enthusiast of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great show window for this course."
The English Eales is looking forward to defending a mastership for the first time, although he has won both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It really feels very special," said the player in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open, as it was taken from the program in the year after I won it.
To get back to this part of the world is magic.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from the last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to action on home ground.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad how it went."
With the Trio on the field, the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with one insassess and £ 10 per car with two or more insassesses.

Reduced lung cancer by passive smoking
In the past two decades, fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
This is the result of researchers at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"After our estimates, 167 pulmonary cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he took a own study on this subject from 1994.
At that time, there were 400 pulmonary cancer cases for passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove very complex
The construction work in the Villinger Street is in full walks and "is somewhat in time," said the head of the building station Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as in the underground there is a lot to hide what has not been noticed in the plans.
The traffic, which is constantly hindering the construction work, represents a great problem for the construction force of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of the drivers is already huge in the face of red amps and lockers," reports Heinze.
The road is locked and only the line buses are entitled to transit.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz by the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been very hard already.
But fortunately, we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei cooks the dinner, she doesn't use a herd.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai government in the unruly Indonesian province of Papua, the house woman usually puts a sweet potatoe - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the consumed knob is removed and swallowed with fertile, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the lewbod - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. washing clothing with dry water from the nearby mud.
A mud in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As most recent of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course late work can be dangerous: most village men are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"Nobody dares walk around in the village after 17 o'clock," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1.026 elders should vote in favour of the crew troops through a public survey.
A existing movement that touched on the independence of Dutch rule quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excluded foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as distant as far as it is. The trip includes a 90-minute drive from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour car rental tomorrow.
There is no public transport.
The city with some 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo bushes and of wave sheet roofs converted by rose into various yellow brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their trip here, because journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"We were not used to wear these clothing," Degei says and describes their lively, hand-weaved turban, their dark shirt and their bright rock.
"We had only leaves on our bodies before."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below poverty and have some of the worst child mortality and alphabetisation rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, in possession of the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has reduced gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth estimated 78 billion US dollars.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a destructive presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military citizens and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly 20 million US dollars, including up to 150,000 US dollars to one single officer.
Papuan claims for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated without grace.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribe hochland in the 1970s became the people's murder commission, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We will lose everything" says in a report by the Archdiözese Brisbane from 2016, in which reports of the previous year's cruelty are included, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as events occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased since Papua's resources bring a stream of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants in the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warning Cantnes Sell brown chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetables served with earthnus souce.
Local people fight to stay here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables cheaper on the traditional market than local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai resident who moved to work in the province capital of Jayapura.
"It cost the local papua - the mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President of State, Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to deal with the inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election struggle.
The former roomman secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel deceitful.
"Our hearts have broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a depth only two months after Jocowis' inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The scared children told them that they should turn on their lights.
One of the soldiers took offense on their tone and later returned with four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and hit the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government Commission was put to fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a football court before the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They were carrying ceremonial hunting bucks and conducted the Waita dance - running in the circle and a bird song imitationing - by Papuas Mee Pago-Stamm.
Some demonstrators began to screw stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses are resisting more than three times, they shoot them dead," it says in a official document of TIME that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto Viertel of Enarotali, saw the threat and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left handle," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but he says that the ball came from the series of soldiers gathered here.
"It was overfilled, many shots were fired," he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin was the witness of shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was it," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only wears a name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The head of Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said that his officers wanted to "safe" their station only because she was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the speaker of Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings came only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
In Jayapura, Yokowi held a passionate speech in three weeks in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical misery in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately, so it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra-judicial mechanism to address historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"The majority of injuries have occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are obliged to deal with these infringements, but there are processes to be carried out," he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "all things are regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, who accused the UN of "criminal against humanity", who demanded more than 1,000 death victims in East Timor's blood independence vote from 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights infringements in Papua have already been reported, including the Paniai precaution.
Families of the Paniai sacrifices received such claims with grievous unbelief.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was hit by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"After burying the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shooters haven't stopped.
On Tuesday the Indian police shot the villagers in Paniai's neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drunk when he fished in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Devoted villagers protested before the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers were throwing stones on officers who responded by firing warnings.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot on the crowd and killed one.
"We were so paniced, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was witness, as the injured people were quickly delivered here, says TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribe members of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the Rebellian Army, who claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In recent years, thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai and willingly reserved, under the presumption of the "Safety of National sovereignty".
Some never come up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens insatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Brother is equally out of range.
People here build everything they eat: especially note and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces Note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupias (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the local Papua and the new migrants, which have reached a larger number since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs in the region usually go to the better educated and richer migrants.
Papua has rarely the capital or the skills needed to lead its own companies competitive.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain voluntary.
In the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jocowis's election struggle to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia's most uncomfortable eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of press control means that international pressure to the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the "diversity and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the presumptions of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When a official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human rights messenger Kees Van Baar, Jayapura visited on 4 May, locals broke their silence and insisted on "We want freedom", according to a source that also took part in the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua says that they will probably not vote again for Yokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a robberian military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai leaders, like other Papua, consider their voice for Yokowi as a "should" that he must pay back.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a last symbolic act of despite: the body of a victim was buried in a field just against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never come to justice, but at least they do not let the responsible people forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with a lower head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire records the 'Torch' cloud crater of Dubai for the second time
On Friday, a fire found in one of the world's highest living towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meters high, 79-storey buildings.
It is the second fire that feds through the high house in only two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (Fackel Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We have been sleeping and we have risen at the fire alarm and in the cry of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor," said a resident who indicated his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting at 4.00 p.m. local time (00.00 p.m. GMT) were clearing the fire and cooling the building.
The government said that she was working on the provision of accommodation for the affected.
The incident can resume questions about the safety of materials used in outside areas of high houses around the world.
A study by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that the majority of the damages came from the clothing, the outer garment to decoration or isolation.
In the UK, the police said that they believed that the system of plates for isolation and clothing at the London Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June where about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: Next Best-of-Five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has met with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup only on two profit rates was not supported by the necessary two-three-three multiplier.
Although the five-state classes are often very long, but they are also highly estimated, the tradition is therefore being retained.
63.54% of the Member States voted in favour of the reform, so the objective of the ITF President David Haggerty was only shortly missed.
"We respect this decision, but it is disappointed that our Member States have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," said Haggerty.
You will continue to work on improving the application.
Not until the vote had been taken, after many objections, before the proposal to carry out the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only relatively smaller details: This is how the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements on training sites etc. are facilitated and the players will have to complete less official media term before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden items into the plane, find out a survey
A survey on passengers showed that more than 20 per cent of the goods were conscious or unconsciously prohibited by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 per cent that entered the plane while they had accidentally banned knifes or other objects with clungs.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had been late discovered that they were misleading with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey with more than 1,000 people - carried out by a Jet Charter Service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers rather disregard the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were consciously trying to fly with something that was prohibited by the TSA, 19,7 percent of Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of the generation X.
The most frequently passed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to carrying objects with clungs through safety control, while 2.2 percent of female interviewers and 3.7 percent of male interviewers also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the plane.
The company said it had asked travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods had brought through airport safety and how many would have deliberately done it.
It is not surprising that the people who wear the earliest smuggleware - knowingly or unawarely - were those who were most frequently flying.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure of which liquids they may take or how much of it.
It is therefore not surprising that the largest amount of the liquids covered by the TSA is prohibited.
For a while, people thought that the TSA could view books as a smuggleware.
Fluids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Cancel tens of thousands of Tesla customers Order
Electro-Tusendsassa Elon Musk with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far supposed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their unpaid reservation.
In addition to the always triumphing figures on turnover increases and even more enormous sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time, in the announcement of the recent quarterly balance, explained a different, less glossy number: those of cancellations at the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk had often won the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: 63,000 have already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 pre-orders.
Criticals had repeatedly pointed out that it was only non-binding reservations.
In the case of a cancellation, Tesla pays EUR 1000 (in the United States 1000 dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "Reservation payment" fully.
At the moment, 455,000 such incompatible reservations are available, Musk admitted to a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambiguous growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 it is supposed to be - all models together - 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
Anyone who today orders a "model 3" can expect the delivery at first in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla is making it possible to drive its nail new, never tested production roads in practice without major interruptions with maximum burden.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are greater delays, then the incompatibility of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
For then, the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA-Chef Pruitt withdraws because of the delay in the Obama era rules to reduce emissions
One day after he had been accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the Chief of the Environmental Authority, rejected his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama Era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smog due to air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his Agency proved to be the needs of the public environmental authorities to respond faster than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint which had been raised against his former office in a Bundesberufungsgericht.
It is a time limit of 1 October for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for bodennahes Ozon.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "incorporating himself into local decisions or obstructing economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a state prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental legislation for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly deployed to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden return from Wednesday is the latest legal relapse for the Pruitts' regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal occupational court in Washington decided that the EPA manager had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of an Obama administration rule, which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane lecks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that its turnover at Ozon Standards simply strengthen the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the time limits for implementation and then waited for the charges of activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority we have."
Nevertheless, the EPA opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use its "authorities to delay and all other legally available powers" in order to ensure that the rules are "based on a solid policy and the best available information".
The Republicans in the Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft legislation approved last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
The New York Advocate General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the States who had accused the EPA this week, said that the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkians and over 115 million Americans directly affected by smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and Columbia District.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refiners, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of humans and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of the public health and the environmental protection were joyful over the surprising exchange of courses.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to keep this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crossing of the Trump government to offer themselves to environmental polluters and their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church
750 years St. Hilarius Church: At the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old Friedhof Areal in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 16.30 p.m.
Whether his idyllic location and beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius facility a popular place to consume.
Visitors of the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be magnified by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the place has made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen to their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique soft dog."
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergian literature book: Graf Hermann of Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogti" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
After the text of the document, there was a glorious court that belonged to the Church or the Patronate’s right and not reversed on the Tumming Mountain.
So people also lived there.
According to the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, the "Berg" of the third, the magnificent village of the village, alongside the suburb and the Oberdorf, which are currently to be seen in the local picture of Tumlingen, was the "Berg" of the third, the magnificent village.
Old maps from the time around 1600 underpin these historical events.
The patronate law originated from the premature self-currency law.
A master who built a church, equipped and occupied with a priest remained owner of this church and could also inherit this own church.
That was the right to set up a priest or to suggest a new priest to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The bigger of the two collapsed on Christmas in 1673.
The newly created bell then drowned for the first time in 1692, but later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the windows were hit and the bells were stolen.
The roof wasn't.
In 1796, French troops stored near the church.
They broke out the candle and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Rests of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
By 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Friedhof also served as the last rest for the dead from hearers.
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church was canceled.
Only the church tower left.
In the New Year's Night, 1834, a storm scattered the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was canceled.
Only the towers still present today remain as a witness to the 750 years old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter wash by the "creative pensioners" as followers of Dieter Dockhorn carries the Hilarius plant.
As an organizer, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, July 16.
This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium of Funny Town and with word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local chief Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 16.30 p.m.
It's from 15.30 p.m.
At the outskirts of the Serenade, there will be a retromption before the cemetery.
"Get a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide look over wheat to the forest," the organizers show the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only on dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to retain the historical St. Hilarius installation, which is important for tumling and hearing swimmers.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly obliged to take home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini confirms.
Verein wants to test approval of wind wheels
"Boisheim resists" does not see any legal condition for construction and has therefore applied to the Landrat.
The Boisheim Association invited Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Nete.
It was illegal.
The association argues that at the date of approval on 30 December 2016, in the Boisheimer Nete, no wind power plants could have been approved, since at the time in foursen, there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to the Swammtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind energy plants are essentially possible, but at the same time the concentration zone will exclude the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area.
These zones should prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer nete, a few days earlier by changing the area use plan had not approved the district government Düsseldorf, due to a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning, the authorization decision is still illegally and therefore also withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim.
Current status of things: Before the summer break, the City Council has again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer nets; the approval of the district government is still out.
Recognizing: "This means that the grant of an authorisation for the construction of wind power plants is planned to be excluded in this place".
The circle confirms the entrance of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received to the circle of Foursen since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes it to reexamine the matter.
However, they are not expected to lead to a stopping of the procedure.
In view of the ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle did not wish to express itself on Thursday to the argumentation of the Boisheim Association.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of four 200 meters high wind wheels on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company in which the city of Four is indirectly involved had concluded contracts with the owner of the area of about 65 hectares.
The construction of the four wind energy plants aims to cover the electricity needs of around 11 400 households, which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, the Viersen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich with Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor collapse: A woman dies in a terrible accident
One terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o'clock between the Niederwallmenach and the Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Creis).
A woman was injured deadly.
Two more people were easily hurt.
The Landstraße remained locked over hours.
According to police statements, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich took her car with her 53-year-old mother as a companion the L 333 toward Bogel.
City and dealers plan "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are aimed at discovering the shopping opportunities in the inner city in September.
The trade association and city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping bummel into the inner city.
As the chairman of the trade union, Christian König, announced, the "Heimat-Shoppen" week-end should make customers aware of what offers the city's own offers are available beyond the usual supermarket war.
Accordingly, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, home businesses are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the interior's businesses are to invite to the "Mediterranean" houp.
The action aims not only on the inhabitants of the city and the nearer region.
In preparation, advertising spots are in the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the end of the action week, says Christian König.
City administration and trade association cooperate with the industry and trade chamber.
This means that the industry and the city are going to another stage of the project "Attractive Interior".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the burning festival as well as sales-open Sunday, conversations with all commercial operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the absence of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials should be re-established or re-established.
These include couriers and tourists.
But also many inhabitants would have lost the inner city when they were shopping out of sight.
At the end, everyone had to contribute to living the inner city - to renters, the establishments of the entire city and associations.
It was worth to overcome Lethargy with a network that had been partly widespread, King said in spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, announced that on the third day of "Heimat-Shoppen", five Thüringer cities for the first time.
Besides Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Holy Town and Bleicherode.
The day is to "werve for the appreciation of local trade and show its importance for the common welfare of our cities", says Streich.
The action under the Federation of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his direct environment with his purchase behaviour itself.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US School
During construction there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine more have been injured, some of them are severe.
According to the fire war, on Wednesday (local time) another injured person was in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building crashed at the explosion.
A first missing person was also rescued later.
The dead were employees of the school.
As an accident cause, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the holiday time, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressed Mexico for the payment of the border wall after transscriptions of telephone calls.
Transscriptions of phone calls between the US president Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump in a phone call with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto asked to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him because he had publicly pitched the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump launched his presidency campaign with the promise to set up a wall at the southern border of the United States and swore to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transscribed his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published and revealed an excited exchange.
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States refugees who emigrated to Australia would be "suitely", "may" and "dumm" and that the existence of the trade that the Obama government brought would make him look like a "depp" after he had proposed a ban on the transfer of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said to Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford Massacker: Activists bring racist Lynchact back as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury went through a group of spectators in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and went to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns came out to block his way.
The leader of the Mobs - a man of mid-age in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the wind protection disc.
Inside, the insasses floated in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man broke.
"Hold him out of the car!"
Shouting breaks the silence when a young black man was crushed from the cemetery.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just a revelation.
But when a snare is thrown around the throat of "Roger", almost all of the audiences are expelled very real saucers.
Since 2005, civil lawers have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were cut off by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
Nobody was ever accused of the murder.
"It's really incredible that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the postage.
"It's a dirty spot on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congress Advocate of Georgia and a lifetime of civil lawers.
For him it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want punishment, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must receive justice," he said.
"We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive righteousness."
A court physician puts a bed touch over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford-Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI Acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding grafts were suspected in the Lynch process.
But nobody has ever been accused of.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil lawers say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions was always known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote at the pre-election campaign in the summer.
Approximately at the same time as the election, according to information from the FBI of the black farekeeper Roger Malcom, a white base owner, Barnett Hester, during a fight down - supposedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumour in the city had been that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she had wasn't from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, says the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But then when they got away from prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a complot between state and local criminal persecution, which was not only involved in the murders, eliminated proofs and lost the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more skillful.
"It was a electoral massacker," he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you are allowed to register and if you vote, this will happen to you."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual retirement of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde.
Her presentation is spectacular, appealing and is justified in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that he doesn't exist in America anymore.
It's hard to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lightning, because then we are faced with its cowardness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for which this year's production started in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen whites and the rest of the blacks – pressed into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greenes co-regisseur here.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who screams and insults him, angry that he has been sleeping with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n ---- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in smiles.
Greene's laughing the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still looking.
"I just don't believe that white people at that time said 'a ----'."
"But," one of the other black performers jokeed.
"You just have to meet the hard "R."
And right there the energy moves in the room, a feeling of companionship replaces the unpleasantness.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely nobody laughs.
This repetition ends violently and fast.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed with a mourning dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and brings out Billie Holidays' grieving Lobrede "Strany Fruit".
Your voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred metres behind a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost equally divided between black and white.
A couple are invited from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia's pressureful moisture for nearly eight hours when Brooks leads them to the funerals of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrim trip.
Until this point the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you are on the same country where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels splendid.
When the last notes of the song climb out, Greene invites the quantity to come closer and inspect the body names.
Children hock at their heads, register the false blood and the still body and whisper each other.
"You are not really dead," a little boy murmurs, as if he wants to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks for the amount - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in suit that played the Clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his companions and then breaks together in her arms, the emotional burden of performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whisper.
"We know that this is not in your heart.
You did this for one reason."
Later the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta inspired about the postage with a black pair that they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that the performance has left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and do so because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me makes me believe that the Lynchen still goes on," she added, "now it's only called police shooting."
In the same room Tyrone Brook's court holds at his table, he eats and reminds of the citizens' rights.
He said he started planning the performance next year.
"The reproof is in some way inspiring, because it describes the fears of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's so if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever doesn't study his own story, who doesn't know his own story, is condemned to repeat it."
The Wagnerians in Bayreuth compensated the "Good Dæmning"
Also, in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf sets a bunt-frivole inscension in front of gigantic, six-piece scenes.
The rotation belt (shaped by Aleksandar Denic) will optionally show a delicate street corner as well as wallrest and danger bude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Börse.
Before parking an open Mercedes-Oldtimer where the Rhine daughters pose as rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil vessels remember Castorf's lead motive - money, power and greed - that moves through his "ring" scenario.
The three Rhine daughters - songs by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as already in the Rheingold.
Kess brings them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), scratching a body in Hollywood-Manier in the baggage room and giving the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the lovely fiery Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy-weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he hit Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormically celebrated Foster, Milling, Vinke and Dirigent Janowski, who humbles hands to the Merkel Raute.
There is a great applause for the festival orchestra, which appears for the first time on the stage - in view of the great heat again in leger leisure dressing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his regiment was expected with tension.
In 2013, if he had to have a valid peep concert over himself, there was a great joy five years later, in which the single "Buh" rush was undergoing.
Corporal Katharina Wagner must have been happy about it.
"You notice that the audience has grown together with the "ring" in some way," she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience did not only make a form of peace with Castorf, but it had also grown an understanding of its viewpoint.
I'm pulling a positive assumption.
Max Quantity works as volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where else?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture box, once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school in the open day too.
How are your experiences?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, that is, a late-call volunteer.
How's that coming?
Quantity: I made Abitur.
And then a construction engineering study, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized that it's wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there's an insight, there you can see, as it's on the spot, perhaps at the main point, really.
And was it that way?
Quantity: I've collected great impressions.
I'll start my study in social affairs in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Youth Office Heren and study at Hamm at the University of Education.
Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It's probably always about where to make your FSJ.
It can be done from age home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that hurted me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike the construction engineering study?
Quantity: All right, this isn't about calculating static.
You have always other people in their heads, each with a very different story.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been pulled out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any touching anxiety?
Quantity: I'm not the guy for that.
It's an area that gives a lot.
Very much love, much kindness.
There are even negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson reduces further 3,000 jobs and reduces the dividend to resurrect the business
The British Education Group of Pearson said on Friday that it would reduce further 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure the company faced.
The degradation of jobs, mainly announced by Director-General John Fallon for the end of 2018 and early 2019, is also the result of its previous restructuring in which 4,000 jobs were already lost.
In May, Pearson announced, in a third cost reduction programme, a cost reduction plan of 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to recover a business that was taken by the fast step towards digital learning.
The company who sold his participation in Penguin Random House in the partner Bertelsmann last month said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack by Kabul: Nato soldat killed in suicide attacks
A suicide attacker attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a Nato soldier and injured several others, says officials.
Five soldiers and a interpreter had been injured, announced a statement of the Nato.
According to unconsolidated local reports, three civilians died in the event in Qarabagh City.
The bombing is the last violent act that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
In an opinion by the Nato, the explosion had happened on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised sprong set carried by people".
The statement states that all injured persons are in a stable state and are treated in the US Military Hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1,62 civil victims, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide autobomb killed at least 30 people in a primarily Shihitic district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had executed this attack.
On May 31, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly militant attack of the country since the U.S. forced the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump considers to increase the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their politics, and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverts the decision to delay the Smog rules by complaints
The US-American Environment Authority has a decision to delay regulating Obama's government, repealing the obligation of the States to reduce smog-causing emissions, which took place one day after 15 states accused the Agency for the step.
The EPA announced the decision to pursue the so-called "Ozon regulations 2015" late on Wednesday and said that it would show the Agency's obligation to cooperate with states.
"We believe in the dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners," said EPA-Chef Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to measure the ozone provisions - in which the emissions of pollutants should be measured in a part of the country in order to determine where cuts should be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 most of the democratic states, along with the Columbia District, entered the complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental requirements that the former president Barack Obama has set up as part of a broader agenda, which, according to Trump, is to stimulate economic growth.
However, efforts have caused the relapse of the Democrats and Nature Protection Groups, which are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The website of the EPA says that inhalation of air that contains ozone can "reduce lung function and enhance breathing symptoms" such as as asthma.
The Council of the Regions wants Community space
At the end, the decision was clear: in two oppositions, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzels decides to set up a Community area in the future senior apartment.
Before the discussion there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing property has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although there will be a period of time until the area belonging to the church community is in the community's possession, there is no longer a planning barrier for the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community area for this purpose.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the municipality.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square metres of area for a special price.
The administration and majority of the municipal council intend to provide such a community room not only for the residents of the senior residents but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word of "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision taken by the provision of funds for the current budget in the last autumn is reluctant by means of funding.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a Community area would be eligible by 60% of 30%, reports Tjaden.
In order to signal to the investor that in this respect, the decision does not want to throw a knife between his legs, the conclusion that both the satellite - which is inclined to the environment - and the Pultdach - which reduces the trawl height and makes the construction of economics - would be possible.
Unnecessary, not just Wilfried Sohmer, is this addition.
If it helps, he's going to happen the body unanimously.
It's not so easy for the Community room.
Daniela's reputation refers to the many own buildings with which you don't come so far, for now you're leaning out of the window at the community room, she says, "I'm hard doing so".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely pronounced for the Community area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees thereafter a hidden subsidie to assets or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give a subsidie, but a real, marketable counter value, is the objection.
Staiger's request to distort the proposal for a decision shall be found at three advocates.
So it remains with two oppositions in the original programme that Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we take the decision in this way, we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: Wheeler is shining on the street
On Wednesday, a 82-year-old cyclist in Garath was recorded by a car and severely injured at the crossing of the street.
As the police announced, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had come on the road from Hilden at 12.20 p.m. with his bicycle on the road of the Black Road.
The senior wanted to cross the road high at Buchholz Busch.
A driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder went on the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to counter traffic.
He stood up with a car that was steering a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was cast on the street.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a car.
FC Bayern Munich must quit David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without it: David Alaba must let the game suck against Dortmund.
With personal concerns, the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven professionals lack the title defender in the Supercup against the Pokalsieger.
Personal concerns at the German football record champion Bayern Munich become increasingly larger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Carlo Ancelotti trainer must also quit David Alaba in Duell with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
In addition, the coins Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
Ancelotti has been responsible for the five defeat in the last six test games, the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn't good at last."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligent," said Ancelotti, who expects a "slow, intense game".
The Duell of the two German football sword weights draws the fans into their ban.
The party is sold out with 81.360 spectators, the German Football Liga (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walk in the hardness of star to star
In the harz, the first "star path" is to be found in the bottom of the world.
This is planned by the Verein Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "sternal path" meets the need for information of many heart visitors, said it.
He connects nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and star images.
In a first phase up to 2018, the Association plans "to be well-accessible installations in five to six places" in the upper heart.
Inquiry St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network receiver plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path should be extended to train.
"On the star path the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the Association.
They also learned why stars had different colors or why a star was lighter than another, although he was farther away.
It will also be communicated in which a selected star is located and when it is best to be seen.
The association has been operating in St. Andreasberg in the mountain town since 2014.
The location in the centre of the Harz National Park is one of the six most dark regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Protection.
Often from there the milk road and even the Andromeda galaxie with just an eye are clearly visible.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Association, there has been something similar to the planned stars - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's Hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the inside of our solar system, the planet path leads with its booths up to the Hainberg and the starwart - as well as a "exterior" location in Diemarden (member equals) with the planet Sedna.
The steals with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are precisely set up in the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a bullet of 6.5 millimeter diameter, while the exactly 75 meters away sun still measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet’s road is about four kilometres.
While the light takes about eight hours from the sun to the pluto, pedestrians need a good hour up to the steal with pluto.
So walkers are faster than the light in the world room.
But the march to the next fast star would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lo Machenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collisions course to inscend the most exciting box fight in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN-Buros in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unslaught World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down to welcome the World Boxing Organisation Super-Federweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former Four Divisions World Championship Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the Top-Five Pound-for Pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you a lot of luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at ESPN.
When the pair for photos posed, Lomachenko manager Egis climates noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm an earlier feather weight," Garcia recalled.
"I've risen for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down on lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweighters [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Climates asked whether it should be on Pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135 pounds debut this year to agree with Garcia in the next summer (37-0, 30 Knockouts) which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after its lightweight fight in the Forum on September 23.
"This struggle could take place in Pay-per-view mode because all fans have asked for him," Garcia said and later expressed themselves open to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can create this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomakeko as "a huge fighter", and he might participate in his Saturday campaign.
But Lo Machenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks that the Trikamp Champion from Riverside looks very slowly, I'm sorry, Mikey ... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said that the focus is to show stroke strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the moment that was built for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four damaged by tyres
On Thursday afternoon four people were severely injured in the event of an accident on the A7.
After first information, the driver of Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle by 16.30 p.m. shortly before the connection site market widely, probably after a tyre pitcher.
The car slew right into the bowl, where he crossed himself and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially severely injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked to the north for about one hour, then the traffic on the left side of the bike could be carried over at the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
After 2:2, Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the defence formation will bring points.
With the first season game, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, wouldn't have been the two opposite gates at 2:2 against brown silence.
"There were two counters too much, and we have to be more careful in Aue," says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the arc mountains, the triangle chain will also be further optimized.
And a gate after a breakdown, the fortunes do not want to catch up anymore.
"For the future, no one will be on the line next to Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that his team, even after the experiences in preparation with the three chain, is better managed than with the four chain.
"Now I don't know how to act in Aue," his coach Friedhelm Funkel says, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "we're just in the three chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is, but that we better harmonize and we do not do so many play mistakes in the building."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"When you can talk about a misleading start after a decision, you don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," said Hoffmann.
"If we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the pokal, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular seasonal record."
His trainer didn't want to know anything about it.
"The start of the season was only after six to eight play days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about a advantage to Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled early because of an unwettner.
"Now they can actually start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believed that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rise favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know so 100 percent where they are currently," says the internal defender of the Fortuna.
Although guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting in the final (fast) stage of Aue as a light favorite Sunday.
"The fact that we're throwing them away just because we're entitled to come under the first six, it's Blödsinn," says Funkel, whose balance of just a defeat against eye from nine games is very positive.
"There is no team in the Second Bundesliga, which is to beat from front," explains Fortunas Chefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and exciting."
And that's how Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asylum Asylum Evaluation Tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensical Medicine Authority (Redsmedicinal Agency) has started the implementation of the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of the age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsverket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were less-year-old.
Until today, the Migrationsverket has sent 6.880 to testing cases, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from mid-March until 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years old".
The tests shall be carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson by the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are persistent in the past months.
"We see no great difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum applicant has been lying over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that " suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, when X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRT records are made by kneegels, which then are analyzed by dentists and radiologs, was also criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of human biological maturity to see whether they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't do as if we could," he said the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of wrong assessment of a child as adults is low.
The biggest risk is that if the person is nearly under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full in Plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are well advanced.
On Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern local entrance of Lauterbach.
"We are very good in time, it's running super," says Reinhold Light, construction manager in the department of roads and traffic in the Federal Bureau of Freiburg.
In April the work started at the same time at all three renovative bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the building is intended for October, and it is easy to ensure that the schedule is maintained.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a wool bow bridge of concrete dressed with red bunt sand stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the two other bridges, she has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and transport safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.
The two other bridges lead over Lauterbach.
They are made of red bunt sand stone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the local entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metres wide on the north side on Wednesday morning and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a margin fixing that is also used as a operating path.
The southern part of the bridge is to be used a 2,20 meter wide bridge cap on Friday.
Then the walker is supposed to run.
The particular thing is that it is complete parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingertips have required the transfer of directions through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fiber cable that many companies are connected to.
The inhabitants were informed about the project in the pre-working field by handbook.
Furthermore, fish and cancer had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the construction building and the collector in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is one-purely regulated by a amplifier.
For the construction work at the bridge at Lauterbacher Ortseingang, the road is fully locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden".
The costs for the three bridges are totally 700 000 euros.
The whole is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest in German potato salad
It's not so often that parties move on a strike, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is hard to bring under a hat.
The parties represented in the district day of Vulcane (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag on this day because the AfD invites in the Gerolsteiner City Hall Rondell to the poster "great election campaign" invite.
And well-known names start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Federal Day election on 24 September, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are already hours before the start of the event on the spot want not to listen to the AfD students, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifels remain bunt".
Originally, the city-picknick was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly before the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that offers itself there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forums A world and one of the relevant organizers, is really happy: "Happy how many people have met here."
There is music and a lot of food, including a "ur German potato salad, which the AfD could eat without problems," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, showing presence in particular at the railway station, which is only a few metres away from the event sites.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reports about the AfD Vulcan Nebula that he has strived for such an event and got the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but there was an abstention because because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
With a view to the event on the Rondell front, he says: "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."
It also does: By 20 o'clock the Rondell premises provides a band for entertainment, in the city hall several speakers, including the Rhineland-Pfalzian AfD chairman Uwe Boy.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestagswahl, Alice Weidel, and the Vice-President Beatrix of Storch to hold their speeches.
Unchanged is the police presence, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the premises have a longer breath, but there is also cleaning up shortly after 21 o'clock.

Posaune hits Trompete
A rehearsal with the Wolfach Posaunist Frederic Belli is available in the series of Haslacher Kloster concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpet Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Blacksee meets on Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" also applies to a classic German training with roots in the blass music.
Both solists are winners and prizemakers of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European topnorchesters.
So is Petkov Solotrompeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Beli is Soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both unite the desire not only to cross the limits on their instruments but also to merge the limits of the different genres.
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach joins the two as in a new dress, Daniel Schnyders "World Music" with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of the Jazzecho prizemaker Nils Wogram, mix classic, jazz and free plays into a fascinating total artwork.
This core of the programme was first launched this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Kloster Church with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart speaks of their bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything," said Kristen Stewart quite openly about their bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, "Oh, that was cool, what's next?"
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was the "Twilight"-collage of Robert Pattinson, who finally became bitterly distinguished.
Despite all this, the brunette performer insures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was in love with everyone I did.
Or do you think I'd played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and believed in it sincerely.
So it has never confused me or hindered me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously."
Besides, she suffered, according to "Bang Showbiz" in school, when she prefered to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me very much.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a bub.
I felt really attacked, scared and shamed.
Now I look back and think, "Girl, be proud of you!"
Especially the public don't like to explain her life of love: "The people expect you to behave in a certain way and that is angry with me.
And perhaps some say I'm unpleasant, but I don't like to have to justify myself before the whole public."
The governor of West Virginia announced that he switched the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday at a announcement with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have removed from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you if I am a democratic governor."
The advertisement broke out in joy.
"I'll change my registration to the Republicans tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a trainer, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not accept the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee gave a declaration on Thursday night, saying: "The party exchange of Governor Justice is another battle for a Democratic Party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last refusal of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and is not able to find a positive, unanimous message," said the RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement in the CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for Doping-Scandal
On Thursday, Sebastian Coe, the world leader of light athletics, praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken back into sports.
Russia's Lichtatletik-Chef Dmitry Sylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the pre-night of the light athletics World Championships that the exhibit of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight the doping.
He said that he was sorry for "all athletes that were taken away from gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of State-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole convention were pleased that the Russian Federation has acknowledged in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reconstructed."
Coe said he was also "glad" that Russia accepts the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to resume Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything in the next months to normalize this situation.
The main principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will act as neutral players in the light athletics world championships, which start on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria.
The director of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for restoration.
Drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Traurery for soldiers crashed in Mali
During a mourning celebration in the northern Hezekian Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two people were thinking of a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dome Town under high security arrangements.
The defense minister Ursula did not say anything about the Leyen (CDU).
However, she referred to the two killed pilots as "children of her professionals".
"We deny ourselves before the highest sacrifice they made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and 47-year-old staffman from North Hessen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Western African Mali.
Their sarges were transferred to Germany and brought along on Thursday by a death guard of the Federal Army to the Fritzlarer Dom St. Peter.
In the afternoon, only the members of the church took off.
After that, the mourning celebration began in the family circle, closest friends, representatives of the Federal War and politics.
Among these were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Traury guests laid roses, the family was armed at the peasants.
In front of the church, Fritzlars and many soldiers followed the ceremony on a linen wall.
The Defense Minister of the Leyen referred to the deceased soldiers as "high decorated" and explore the operation.
The chief of the staff had built up the flight operation of the fighting helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regime.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regime, among which the soldiers belonged, also stated: "If this crew couldn't turn off the crash, it wouldn't have been possible for anyone."
Doubt on the UN mission in Mali did not show the Leyen minister: the operation is dangerous.
But he is also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the grief celebration, the swords were brought out of the judgment.
When and where they are buried, the Federal Army did not provide information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be buried next to his wife after his death.
That told the king's house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish king's pair is attended in the Doom Church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarkophag for the two.
The queen agreed to her husband’s decision, continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, be still unclear.
But he does not intend to be joined in his French home.
Prins Henrik had never made a hail from being happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe's throne set up in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also departed the title "Prince Paint".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not receive the title and function he wanted, he did not view himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house, explained.
Where the last rest place of the 83-year-old will be finally, be still unclear.
But he intends not to be joined in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years.
The born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French native, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
At the Themse he worked in the French message.
During his later wife, Prince Henrik had always a heavy stand in his nearly 50-year reign with the Danishs.
In an autobiography, Henrik expressed over the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk foams instead of stripes, citroën instead of volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia-Tabak and who had here the reputation of being the brand of society-critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope for surveillance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
They were like two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick new election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Niedersachsen's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green majority of governments for a rapid re-election of the country day, but he does not want to resign.
That is why on Friday the Parliament's resolution was pronounced.
Previously, the surprising withdrawal of a Green Member from its Land Day Group in Lower Saxony had collapsed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country-day election, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its narrow one-stimm multitude in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Greens Member Each Twest justified their step with the non-Nomination for the 2018 election in their election circle in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Group Head Björn Thumler wants to recommend that his group take them.
This means that CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the Dutch country day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship was reversed.
The new country day will be elected regularly on January 14th.
Thumler said that the red-green government now had to decide whether they could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, thinks it is essential that the country day decides its self-resolution as soon as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The Constitution also provides the possibility that the country day withdraws trust to the Prime Minister and chooses a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be legally checked cleanly," said Thumler.
"You will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally reasonable."
Thumler called Twesten's step "but something curios".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a betrayer.
I feel very good."
She referred to himself as a follower of black-green.
The Greens called on the abstinent Members to return their country-day mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she returns her landday mandate, which she received via the green country list, with immediate effect," the national president Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner communicated.
The president of the Group of the Green Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of every twest."
It has decided consciously not to take a debate in the Group.
"Even in the background that there were no content differences, we can't follow this step."
SPD Chancellor Candidate Martin Schulz condemns the violation of the Dutch Greens Members Every Twest to CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to the voters but also betrayal to red-green", wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to let the country day be re-elected quickly.
The exit of Twestens costs the majority of Red-Grün in Niedersachsen.
The politician put her personal interests toward the welfare of the country "in her injured idleness and frustration", criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intrigen game and is trying to beat political capital from it."
Niedersachsens CDU Group Head Björn Thumler would like to recommend that his Members take each Twest into the CDU.
The SPD Group Head of the Federal Day, Thomas Oppermann, invited Twesten to distort the result of the 2013 country day election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force in front of the SPD, SPD and Green had a thin majority of one voice in the country day.
Agricultural Minister in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoning eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses infected eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
Agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) speaking and answering.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.Livsmedicinal warning.de, the Bundesländer shall submit the latest information on the affected egg charts.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clarator is not really perceived by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the task of the federal countries.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately turned up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since Germany has been acquainted with.
All information and risk assessment are available for consumers.
Trade has to ensure that the products sold are transportable and healthless, as well as the manufacturers.
If the maximum residue content of eggs exceeds 0,005mg/kg, they are not trafficable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time the companies are not guilty.
Are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production companies do not have a direct debt.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to illegal practices of service undertakings.
As always, there are too little controls in serious cases.
Does only the personnel or the ultimate responsibility lack?
It was just the official checks that revealed the process.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent.
In particular, a consistent disclosure of such incidents and the transfer to public prosecutors in cases where crimes may exist is crucial.
I have already repeatedly made it clear that I expect a lucky information from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive exclusively safe and transportable foods.
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly discouraged.
This is the basis of the planned means that manufacturers, traders and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary.
Basically, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the holding of food supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the case is quickly and loosely clarified.
How the financial rules of the football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure from European football associations will not disturb Neymars World Record Transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, because the Governing Organisation, who has monitored the European game, has the power to prohibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions-League tournament.
Financial Fair Play rules, which were launched by the UEFA in 2011, mean that the PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
The PSG can surely make the money loose so that Neymar signs and brings it to another star's galaxy, given the financing of the team by the rich dominant family of Katar.
Associations may spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but they have to counterfeit with legitimate income sources that allow them to break the eleven point in their business related to the football.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations who had taken tremendous debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support.
In 2011, FFP moved from the concentration to the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP allocation period, which runs by 2018, clubs can increase losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini has fallen in Ungnade in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to deprive of excessive expenditure.
"Surely, FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA, against The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a standard, it can distribute the amount for the accounting of the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sum of the sales for the next five years can be allocated to 44.4 million euros in the financial statement.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, has met with the most serious sanctions.
The PSG received a penalty of EUR 60 million (currently $82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members remain limited to 21 players instead of the 25 players in the 2014/15 Champions League.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overcome their financial supervision by bleeding their revenues by companies connected with the owners of a club.
While a cataric company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsoring of the PSA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Katar on payments from the WM 2022 Organization Committee.
But PSG and Katar 2022 have contested that Neymar WM will become a messenger and could easily find out such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulation authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to every attempt to deal with the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG on Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke with The Associated Press under the condition of anonymity, as they were not empowered to discuss the PSG situation.
The recent reports show that PSG 2015/16 gained more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, Merchandising and Trikot sales.
The association assumes that the sales will increase by at least 30 per cent after the signature.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's withdrawal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily newspaper AS regarding Katar's last ownership of PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports cycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a State which finances a association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has a association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In recent years, chocolate Frey has produced board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the soft cooperation is before a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss-speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the Friday newspaper "Nordwest Switzerland".
According to current planning, the Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"With the current supplier chocolate Frey we are very satisfied," said the speaker.
Approximately 17 million small red-weighted shoggi tables to 14 grams per year distribute the flight companions to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs.
Brancheninsiders estimate the volume of order according to "Nordwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughters achieve an annual turnover of about one billion francs.
But more important is all the advertising effect: It is a prestigious job for a schoggi maker.
How many candidates there are in the new invitation to tender, the Swiss do not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to seek a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
chocolate tablets have distributed Swiss on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The possibility of placing the logo introduced Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with different Swiss chocolate producers.
At long-distance flights, the customers of the First Class are cured by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class nasty passengers Schoggi by Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolate Frey.
Swiss Schoggi also distributes on the short track by Chocolat Frey, both in the business and in the Economy Class.
Light athletics - Discus-Olympiactor Robert Harting reaches WM-Finale
The three-fold world champion fights a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic Assembly, failed in the National WM Exhibition and could only look at the Discus competition from the Tribüne.
Similarly, with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 metres away, qualified for the end struggle.
Nostalgie goes in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the Nische
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s Grunge Era (when the predecessors David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch Comedie "The State" for MTV) and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to larger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is also a parodie and a embodie of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like the time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (which contained an original story for a speaking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffing on the core of the gag - actors in the middle of age play gentle children who will grow up - they nevertheless made the impossible to win the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parodie goes more according to the Gießkannen principle, including a rifle on the Stalker films of the 90s, such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that swings the wall").
On one point, a character comes through an Apple Powerbook, some Inline Skates and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The loving Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another crazy-like plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a successful impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the everlasting young Mr. Rudd, which shows Matt Dillon's subtleable of "Singles", whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knacker.
There are the moments of coincidence that this franchise could warm up like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" at Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgie: the relief of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even the "GLOW" with its east-gen-West Ringkampf Iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates that it is a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two cops as friends, two officers from Bucharest, fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism leninism.
The main roles - a hard-sotted Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to look at (the police spend time watching chess on TV, how Americans may do it with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so engaged in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a reagan bag is included - that it often plays like one.
In six long episodes it moves away, and the comodie is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was edited to a lesser length, could better deliver his Agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef always visit the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a bunch of Hamburgers.
The message for the imaginated communist audience is that western culture can make everything to feed for a layer.
The fictional Romanian Creator was not wrong: we do it even with our own younger history and with its own.
Battle against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in a battle against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, many objects were searched in the Black Forest Barry War, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the state lawyer announced Konstanz on Friday.
15 accused persons aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and had already been arrested against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, guns and several hundred thousand euros.
Two persons were arrested in the case of contemporary racing in Italy.
There were German warrants against the two suspects of Italians.
Therefore, they are probably delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian mediators were involved in the action.
Over 300 policemen were in operation.
The members of the Mafia are proposed of organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and oppression.
Since summer 2016, the State Advocateship has determined constance against organised drug trafficking in the southern German area.
Between the state prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a strong exchange and the mediators of the Kripo Rottweil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Thus, the great effort was accompanied by four Palermo officials on Wednesday morning.
In the course of the investigations, most of all Italian nationals had a close reference to the Italian mafia.
A incident in Hüfingen on 27 May, where several shots were fired to a restaurant early in the morning, is expected to go to the account of the band.
How to complain about big gaps in the foreign register
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany reveals significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious failure decisions in asylum procedures.
Frank-Jürgen, the representative of the Federal Government's refugee management, said that a media report has highlighted large gaps in the foreign central register.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partly severe failure decisions" in the case of asylum procedures and disclosures, warned in a analysis of the "South German newspaper".
According to the register, ten million people with foreign nationality, including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries, are included in the register.
Accordingly, the data are managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data have not been adequately maintained, the quality of data in parts has not been good until now.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register".
"Error data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," the report continues.
The statistics on travelling persons include other EU citizens who do not have to travel out at all.
Such false allocations, however, led to "a distorted debate on the dealing with travellers," then it says in the analysis.
In the meantime, the Federal Government apparently began sending refugee families back to Italy with children under the age of 16 when they arrived from there.
This comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
Accordingly, in the paper, the BAMF has carried out such procedures "for families with children - except infants and infants - back to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was virtually not possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the spot.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees in the EU Member State are responsible for reaching them first.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, this State can send it back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has issued guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECMR) considers that these commitments are sufficient.
Other EU Member States would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The internal political speaker of the Left Group in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children are threatening because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights infringement conditions and a danger of child welfare".
Second best results
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichbach already provided the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
All in front of Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the municipality at the meeting of the municipal council appreciates the repeated willingness to spend blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed to do so, and we pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers, yet unequivocally," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood donation helps several people," explained the Circularity leader of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conserves are broken into their components.
Three people could once benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in Oberreichbach in the spring.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK crisis leader.
Apparently, the change to the theatre house has resulted in higher numbers of participants a few years ago.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were the multiple donors and were awarded 50 blood donations each.
Half so many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter delivered ten times per 500 millilitres of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakness of inflation have reduced speculations by an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "compensation" when it maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a stronger pressure.
The political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 in order to maintain the interest rates to 0.25%, while fewer members were seeking to increase this month, since weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% for 2017 and 1.6% for 2018 and warned that pressure on budgetary income would continue, with an estimated increase in the fall to nearly 3%.
But it signaled that in the next few years interest increases would be necessary to raise the inflation heated by the Brexit and said that the credit costs may have to increase more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing a part of the Mammut economic package issued a year ago after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide more cheap financial resources for banks from the next February, although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling.
A few minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (BIP) remains short-termly weak, as pressure on real income of the households continues to burden consumption."
It reiterated the interest rates that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool the inflation and a "at somewhat greater" extent than the markets expect.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank emphasized that increases would be "steply" and "limited".
The bank's downlined growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
She maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth rates have decreased the rising expectations of an increase in interest and GDP increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
In the third quarter, growth is expected to be 0.3%, although it will be easy to recover from the bank by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by increasing inflation and low wage increases, as intensification is getting worse first before it gets better.
She added that the monetary policy in the next few years cannot "prevent the income break", but she added that at the end of its three-year forecast, the wages will be "definitely" recruited.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will compensate some of the lower consumption expenditure.
One year after the reduction of interest rates, the decision comes to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the reduction of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to reach prices and the economy completely.
Before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the reputation had risen after an increase in interest, as inflation increased the pressure on hardly impaired households, and three political decision-makers demanded an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has decreased from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and will redress in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2% would be a "ganz" attribute to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in the Swap Councils, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive, since the creditors are strongly looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those with whom the existing deals expire and finish the new hypocriticals, and many with free of charge options and low rates are increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is intended to prescribe 10,000 people in controversial HIV drug
From September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the NHS, patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment.
NHS England announced that pre-exposition pre-exposition pre-exposition prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now delivered by health service over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the process after the Court of Appeal had confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The Schachzug announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chef Simon Stevens as "weighty new intervention" while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this "decisionary moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first that will allow the registration of people, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in all England in April 2018.
Pre-exposition pre-exposition pre-exposition pre-exposition pre-existing is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infected patients.
Taking PrEP before sex means that just enough medicines are available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
Among those who are in question for treatment include shoes or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified that agree to the study, including men, women, transmitters and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a household doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.
The programme will be £ 10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of the medicines this week after an internationally competitive purchase.
The study aims to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as used in a large scale, incorporated and implemented.
Stevens said: "This large new intervention should complement and retain the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in tackling one of the greatest health challenges of mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when it is targeted to needy and endangered people, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner, which leads to improving many, many lives.
We welcome this announcement very warmly."
Ian Green, Vice-President of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is being conducted quickly throughout the country and that no one with a risk of HIV is left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are in the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overwhelmed after monthly delays and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transfer of this life-changing infection can end.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is conducted as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us to get a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society'.
The big life life: intermediate and smart designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, an ex-banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.
"Therefore I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I was in love with her and made an offer this day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overcome.
Originally a one-room property with a slighted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne vacuum and an intermediate floor to use the generous ceiling height optimally.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, much light.
That was my demand," she says.
For this purpose, she ordered the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a intermediate floor in which you could stand.
He had to think creatively to solve the standard.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to buckle.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height over each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
On both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer.
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the covers and glasses of Joanne.
By perception of a more glamourous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Collapseable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A little engineering art went in there," explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweighty, so when you move up the door, it's very easy to glide."
Thanks to the clever use of space and vacuum, Joanne could win 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the ground area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate maker will enter into and carry out a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to increase the ground surface and simultaneously use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create a emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't love the electrical sticks in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that a apartment can transform into something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters of something standardly.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis live in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and business capabilities.
Paul has been trying to withdraw from the family company since 2014, but a sharp dispute on separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice.
Together with her mother, Anna, the brothers have 38 real estates worth more than half a billion dollars, collected since the family bought a business in the Smith Street, Collingwood.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the foretown.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul described as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of company capital and Paul about one third.
A case states that this means that Colin owns 316 million dollars and Paul valued 176 million dollars.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place on Friday after several failures.
The brothers are now fighting for the control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claimed to have excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but suggests Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.
In a early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers held by both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicate food shops in the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the first Jeansladen of the family.
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was a little child (approximately 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to portray their property to their sons kindly.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land before court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million and $26 million when he left the company.
Both Luke and Mark have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation.
Colin remained very relieved, although he was an ex-administration member of the AFL and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I can't really say much," because the case is before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to accuse me and pull our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother's claims.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said and added that he "everywhere hoped for a solution".
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump's new head of staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried it and have failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If yes, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new Head of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the head at a more uniform course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Head of Staff of the White House, met with executives on his first working day, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that was in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the employees that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in letterings - because the President would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to temper Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television is decades back - and now that he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If Kandidat Trump was angry because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of positions that were to be convinced," said former electorate consultant Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control is, according to six former election officers, to ensure that their personal media consumption includes a steady prize."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know to others - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more inflammatory without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweets that Trump hasn't sent.
If his employees have been able to keep trouble away from him several times, then their efforts have rewarded themselves.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from controversy.
A part of the problem is that people in a White House, competing parties, are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that might promote their views from the world.
Politico, who is very concerned with this story, reported in May that the advisors would like to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with harmful leaks, and that he is steep to find out where they come from.
That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave a printed copy to the president of GotNews.com, the Internet prosecutor Charles C. Johnson's website, who accused the Deputy Staff Commander Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a bunch of Lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of Shikans, or that he had not offered any concrete evidence or that he in the past expressed false objections and revoked them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "sought to implement a system to manage and document the paper crawl, which gets the Trump".
How did this work?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Maybe he will prove to be more effective manager than the Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still seeking influence.
These irreversible factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most accused criminals receive post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population will be asked and hoped.
Police in all Europe sends this summer (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the flight.
Since the addresses of the seeking grave criminals are not known naturally, the indications from the population are hoped and requested.
On Friday, Europol reported the action following the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar of winter.
Experiences had shown that many refugees were hiding from vacation destinations, said Europol.
21 mail cards for seeking criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online requests have been arrested until now, at least eleven of them due to references to the publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate through a grave and return to the 'Millionary Row'
Some of the most prosperous house owners of the West Midlands are back with some decisive travellers on warfoot, who have negotiated a grave drawn by the municipality to demand a field before their gentle houses.
The travelers have parked their 20 cars on a field outside a prosperous road from Solihull, called the "Millionary Row".
They brought horses, babies and a army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being scared off by a grave buryed by the Council to prevent their accidents.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense plants and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have insisted on the Solihull Council, who said that it is "nutzless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passengers.
The Council must be forced to be implemented by shame, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived yesterday night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by keeping long instructions to protect her parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop this."
A resident who didn't want to be called said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers, just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and even a horse has been seen in the parking area."
A spokesman of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihull. We take the necessary legal steps to move on as quickly as possible.
In order to support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the forest hotel is Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30,000 nights per year were lost and revenues were also made by the Kurtaxe.
In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who arrived in the district, the hotel building was offered to the Country Council as a collection accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum candidates by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was at that time not contradicted in the municipal council.
But above all Julian Osswald's supple mayor of pleasurenstadt defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested people at the house at the time.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with director Birgit Scherer with a seat in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the Three-Sterne-Plus category named Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the happy town.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been before the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, the extensive renovation work will be made clear.
The soils were ripped out, decks were partially dismantled, old bathrooms were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is much to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
It's supposed to be renewed in the black forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large pleasant showers, the entrance area is transformed, new windows are built in.
Everything should later be "suite citizen", as Thomas Scherer expresses.
"We want to make a jewelry out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment.
You don't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated interior level, emphasises Scherer.
The forest hotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to be wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidays, groups or businessmen should feel well in the hotel.
Talking with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, he already conducted, so Schererer.
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
After the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Nearly below a million euros, he calculates.
The external installations are also brought to the frontman, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia Business: U.S. Special Mediator sets the Grand Jury
In Russia's business around the US president Donald Trump, special mediator Robert Mueller has, according to a report, set up a so-called Grand Jury.
In recent weeks, the body has taken up the work, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" calling on people who are familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
The sender CNN reported that there are already first preloads of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. Secret Services have been accusing the Kreml for a long time to have been involved in the 2016 presidential election fight.
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump's electoral team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations is on several men who acted in the election struggle as a consultant of the Republican.
According to reports, Mueller also increased its private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Agent Trump had entered the centre personally and investigated the presumption that the President might have hindered the justice during the course of the business.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible crime cases and to decide whether charges should be charged.
Grand Jurys is therefore also called complainants.
They are usually activated when it is larger and controversial cases.
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.
The body may also be invoked by the State Prosecutor in order to invite persons to hear under the Eed.
According to the transmitter CNN, preloads were already issued to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who were involved in the meeting were invited to make a statement, said the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then election champion Paul Manafort were involved in the discussion.
Right experts said on Thursday night in the US TV that the institution indicates that Mueller is not intimidating in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be invoked at the end to decide on the invokation of a charge.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the body of the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new releases, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday to present the Russian business as a campaign for its political opponents.
"The Russian story is a total invention," said Trump.
The topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about.
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about the introduction of a Grand Jury.
However, these usually also work in secret, he emphasized.
The White House welcomed any action that accelerated the work of the special mediator in a "fair" way.
The former FBI captain James Comey said three times that it wasn't against the President.
There is no reason to assume that it has changed, said the statement.
But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.
As a result of this refusal, objections against Trump had become loud, he wanted to impede justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to stop the investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special mediator and its employees.
This triggered speculations about whether Trump Mueller wants to release.
Unlike an independent special mediator of the Congress, such as the Watergate Affair around the later President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be fired the theoretically on the pressures of the President by the Ministry of Justice.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
Two groups of republikan and democratic senators presented draft law on Thursday, after which the special mediator could no longer be released so easily.
Antarctica: Gigant iceberg drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has dissolved from the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin from the shelf ice.
This announced the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday.
The colossy, which is more than one billion tons and is more than 5800 square kilometres, now drives north and will probably take two, three years until it is smelted.
It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres one of the largest ice gigants that researchers have registered over the last three decades.
He does not have a danger for human beings.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
However, for some 30 years, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region, the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact background.
According to many researchers, this could be linked to the heating of the earth.
The now canceled coloss was part of the Larsen-C celebration.
Shelfeis swims on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
It thus grows increasingly into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is almost on the top of the Antarctic Peninsula, south of South America.
North of this shelfeise was disrupted the balance of waxes and Cancel a few years ago.
A complete shelf ice broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There are some things that say that the Larsen-C celebration is also in danger, because the front side has never moved back as far as currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under tension and can break if a piece breaks down on a key point.
The melting of shelf ice and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as it swims on the water and ice thins out as much water as it produces after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelf beet causes the glaciers to diminish directly into the sea and flow far faster than before.
This may increase the sea level, but only at a low level, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C shell fee is, according to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the fourth largest shelf ice of Antarctica.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the Swansea University of Britain.
"This is the most widespread withdrawal since the start of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C celebration will grow again or will go back for a long time and may collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will last decades.
Although these researchers do not bring the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, in recent decades, very many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have been destroyed.
This long tip of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
In the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up by about three degrees, counting to the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.
CDU wants to pay for the personnel
Because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy jobs, the CDU calls for the employers' association to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the circuit day has won 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circuit management in Mettmann.
Now, 17 trainees have their first working day behind themselves.
The lectures in the circle seem to be very desired.
About 620 applications were available for the places to be forgiven this year.
Nevertheless, the circle is still missing staff in order to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
There are still 50 unoccupied places at the Mettmann circle.
Among other things, doctors and engineers are visited as well as powers of general administration.
The CDU is now seeking to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the circular day and to face the lack of expertise in the administration.
According to the parties' wish, the administration is to develop "a concept of personnel gaining and development".
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of professionals, but also to resist the future-oriented deficiency of candidates, it says.
The overall concept should be based on internal and external orientations, specific measures for cross-border increases and include educational openness, demanding CDU, FDP and UWG.
That's a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known before.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is about a regular "competitiveness of public employers".
There is a high number of employees who are excluded from the service in sickness or age.
So the maximum time to act so that no more jobs remain unemployed.
However, Klaus-Dieter Völker, Head of Group of the CDU, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
In recent times, he had a deep surprise on the circuit day when he publicly questioned the staff cost coverage and the other parties were surprised.
People want to review all the possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the local employer association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the circuit management with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - should seek a domestic tariff," said the peoples.
The CDU thus attempts to pay employees and officials better than it actually provides for the tariff regulation for the public service.
The salaries are currently prescribed precisely, increases or more money only if you switch to a higher level oriented to professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown increasing in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be established where employees cared for the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum candidates, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: you have too little staff.
Italy intensifies the tone to NGO migrant repair boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said internal minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities had conveyed a boat of the German aid organization 'Young Rettet' because their team had effectively cooperated with human dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself to the detailed objections of the Italian state lawyer Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, and the salvation of human life remains our highest priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on social media.
"We can only assess all the accusations that are being raised after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Young Rettet', Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew takes snailboat immigrants on board that are delivered directly by human dealers and that the smugglers can ride so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting was said to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the act of the State Attorney whose contents were published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of monitoring the authority of the Italian coastal guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats like Iuventa must have a Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in searching and saving efforts have so far declared themselves willing to comply with the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, since they would not bring about "real changes or disabilities" of their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign are the Nobel Price Manager Organization doctors without limits (MSF).
Minniti said now that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in the last few weeks had decreased strongly, indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and cooperation with local mayors had fruits.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palace to enjoy four days of trials and sights.
Three friends were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
Wachenheim's castle and wine festival was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
It followed viewpoints, partly on towers, of which you could look far above the pleasant forest and the pre-layer layers.
In the meantime, there were ever longer increases that rewarded long trials.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, the prospect point was set at the point of view, connected with "flowing" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many height meters were again set.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and return huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed in the free-air inhalatorium healing sole.
Neustadt was also charged.
After 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 height meters, the group had met the pleasant forest from its best side - sports and cultural.
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is equipped for E-Sport
Are the sports stars sitting before computer consoles in the future instead of fighting through the stage terraces at wind and weather?
In fact: E-Sport has long become a serious industry, become a luxurious business - big stars, million fans and huge tournaments with high gages including.
This has also recognised the first federal Leagues who are increasingly engaged in this area.
The beginning of 2015 was VfL Wolfsburg, followed by the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two professionals to the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope thereby to enthusiasm very new young target groups for the VfB," says director Jochen Rottermann.
He's sure, "that there are still some associations on this train."
In the next weekend, the FIFA World Association will organise the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the players of various clubs come against each other.
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees a great potential in the E-Sport.
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises a virtual football player agency.
"The real football has to deal especially with the 14 to 30 years old that the young people are still going to the stage in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian.
With prominent E-Sporters under contract, you could be present online far more frequently on these markets than to send the Federal League to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the FIFA football simulation are struggled at competition level.
Longly, as in normal sports, lies have established in which the professionals come against each other.
And in the Asian games of 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official programme.
But is it at all a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly needy.
Ingo Froböse has also discussed the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports High School in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that you also find in classical sports - e.g. increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capacity.
Professional players should not only train the console, but also train their body and take care of the diet.
"The fitted player is a good player."
Frobous, however, also sees problems: "Doping becomes more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing.
The scientists highlight the high integrative effect of the e-port.
The players are internationally on the way, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.
A study of company advice Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth to the E-Sport.
In 2016, EUR 50 million had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years, sales are estimated to be 130 million.
This is little against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football League.
However, the E-Sport is "not far away from the other established sports, such as handball, basketball or Eishockey", writes Deloitte consultants.
International are many countries already on.
Large markets are Asia and the United States, where ex-Basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood shake player Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting uniform.
There are also some things in Europe.
In a Norwegian school E-Sport had been introduced as a teacher, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and in France, the Football Firstliga Associations are now obliged to set up an E-Sport Department.
"In the European comparison Germany is behind it," explains the VfB Board of Redgermann.
Just falling in Nostalgie and explaining the old times is no longer enough today.
It is about preserveing the tradition of the association, but at the same time, the company is in the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," also Dutt says.
"There's no way you can hold on that only in the football, it's all the way it was."
Gift egg ade - The egg-alternatives for cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all the federal countries have been affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs.
Aldi South and Aldi North have responded and took all eggs from the sale across Germany.
Only eggs that do not prove to contain fipronil should be taken into the regimes.
Michelle Carter sentenced for the texts that push Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind grids and five years have been expelled for payment.
Carter was sentenced in June for the fatal killing of Conrad Roy, who died on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is inconsistent.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free until he called.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered from a psychiatric disease.
Carter was dressed in red hooks and a cream-coloured blossom, with tears in his eyes, with folded hands and downward eyes when she was sentenced.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She finished his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"She did not repent."
But Carter's lawyer said it's a "a terrible situation that she's totally sorry."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that "your age or maturity or even her mental illness has a significant influence on her actions".
A state lawyer read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is "no day I don't trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am dealing with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will bear with us for eternity," says it.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "followed" by the knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be aunt for his children.
"Not having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth, is a pain that I will always be kept with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to have a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case took national attention after Carter's text releases revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Keep up, jump from a building, first you yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Amanda Knox was one of the few defenders of Carter, who was sentenced for murder in 2007 to her British resident in Italy before she was released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new mini lamb of the FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up at the Audi Cup as a captain, is not a chance.
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed-Cup-Beaster a large season - Extra-Motivation does not hurt there.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even if the extra clothing was very small.
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, wasn't to see Philipp Lahm and not even Manuel Newer, he made the bond assigned to him to hold on to his arm.
"The trainer didn't announce it," said the Confed-Cup-beaster after his first use as Bayern-Captain.
Well, the concession could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also describe Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been elected as a leader in the professionals from youth players, debutants and just from vacation, but he.
You prefer to distribute sugarl to those who you trust a lot you want to keep.
Thus, whoever has been embraced to join the inheritance of Lahm can only use a small extra motion well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday the 22-year-old fled as a mini-lam over the field.
Right back, that's now his position, the white bond on the arm you did the other thing.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this starting formation like the one who can take the ruder in the best hand.
He gave instructions, attempted to lead the unleavened troop.
He had the view for all, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness (fought hardly); Renato Sanches to knock out on the devil to the performances of the Asian journey (which was only working); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not to be negative in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot.
That always worked well.
Sile ran next to Kimmich, Rudy before the warrant, both acted sovereignly.
The pleasantly occupied Napoli storm was often difficult, and the pillar also tried to succeed a few times in the game building.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not the way we hoped it was."
But he also showed a regular performance at the debut.
Game shifting, tempo change: "For this style I was also taken."
How unusual this Bavarian world is still for the new access, it was seen after the party.
For example, Rudy did not give one or two in the catacombs, but definitely six or seven interviews.
Kimmich, after a few knocky statements, adopted himself in the back of his new players.
There he heard from Süle a interesting sentence: "What's happening here, I've already noticed.
You just have to win every game with Bayern."
But he doesn't have to teach the new ones.
Alaba motivates OFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our OFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer reported about Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all good.
The Bavarian legionary is a quasi club colleague of ÖFB-capitänin Schnaderbeck and fevers with our ladies.
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champions-League winner should be a special motivation syringe.
The famous Bavarian dusel might also need our ladies well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Pfalzian Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often uncomfortable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Pfalz.
This appears after more than a year when the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Triererer Company Association (VTU), says: "Wissing takes the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked".
The biggest turn is Natus in the infrastructure policy: The gap of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes that a planning procedure will be established until 2021.
A role in the country's plans also plays the West Climate Trier, which is in the premature need of the Federal Road Plan.
The aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020, says Ministerial Speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a guide to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Industrial and Commerce Chamber (IHK) Trier, as instructed by Wissing, seeks to apply a Rhineland-Pfalz label in wine to increase the sale in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been depleted for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, the IHK praises.
The craft chamber Trier sees in the new Master-Bonus an additional incentive for young educators, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A prize of EUR 1000 is provided for the master test and EUR 2500 if graduates make themselves independent within 10 years after master training.
The home tasks list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts are rapid, while the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, head of IHK Trier.
From 56 new engineers who want to set up Wissing mobility at the country operation, only 29 jobs have been occupied.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU-Fractionsvize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invests more than 20 million euros in the acquisition of national roads in 2017 and 2018.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country to address the lack of professionals in the region.
It is also enthusiastic for the broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed network supply in an IHK survey only with note 3.4.
They complain about stocking internet connections and interruptions.
On the other hand, Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of Wind Company.
The Green Group left Lemke to April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe, where she already left the field after four months of disagreement.
Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter-reaction
One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said that the company was of the opinion that "there is more intelligent options than driving restrictions", and thus related to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there would be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the businesses as a callback.
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with CO2 emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emitte diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for automotive manufacturers to install installations for neutralisation of the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increases, which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of enhancing the powerful car companies and to ignore signs of the problem.
The companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagens that were used by so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the requirements when a car was tested but ride back in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were accused of people’s cars, others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former thermodynamics leader was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put before court in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations in Volkswagens after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to violate emissions in Europe, and a question focused on the United States was extended.
Audi's involvement in the investigation could have a serious burden on Volkswagens: the luxury car manufacturer contributes overproportional to the profit of Volkswagens.
This message has the river on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to also join the Isar visitors, on Saturday morning, a river passes through Munich, which has a special message.
When it draws to the Isar on Saturday again, it will see a great fleet between the flakes and the Reichenbach bridge.
And that's not a usual fleet, with isar tourists.
Except the construction refractory wants to clarify.
On the fleet you can see a large information transparent.
It shows a wasteberg.
The record of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Wahre Love is ..." the understanding of the Isar as a protective wildflow.
Already last summer, the fleet crossed the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a thorough and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillos Knollennasen and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon signs, the knobnases of his figures are his mark.
With 85, the Argentinian still draws and works on a film.
His message: laugh, "for there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he, among other things, struck himself as a sign for lucky cards - which frustrated him.
"The most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he reached the end of the 1960s of the breakthrough: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China Mordillo found many fans.
Once again, the artist reads inspired of cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures are scattered in drawings with the tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
Early in the morning, according to his own information he is still sitting on the sign table today, working nearly ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, pleisters and watches continue to find much spread worldwide.
For six years, he has been working on a drawing film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a Giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousandfooter as a counter player.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say it's strange to me," says Mordillo.
It's not written by him.
That is why he puts more on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced anywhere.
Lavendel from Provence threatens climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavendel is reduced due to the drought conditions and insects transferring to diseases, which creates great headaches to scientists and farmers who try to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The Lavendel in Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This has an impact on the lifetime of Lavendel.
There is also a small cigade, a microbacterium transmitting dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot on the game.
Lavendel oil attracts not only for holidays, it is also very demanded for parfum and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with etheric oil."
The solutions considered include a better water distribution and slowing down the soil dilution, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of species resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the German Rhine celebrates its 1200-year-old existence.
Festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Creamers, tents, traders, Vaganten or a land servant camp should be experienced in the inner city on these days.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of Riodoce Weekly usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unstopping drug wars.
But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
It was told them that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with granates in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary to reach perceptions and stomach feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's salary list or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that put the chaos of Mexico in danger.
There is no rest of violence, and while the bodies are hoping throughout the country, more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto joined his office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and there were at least seven deaths in seven states this year.
Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His lack is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", hangs to the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smile face with glasses or his typical Panama hut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the dreams, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a special federal lawyer was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, it has, according to the Journalist Protection Committee, launched only two criminal proceedings.
Like most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime every year, journalists' murderers are only rarely put before court.
With Riodoce, they are still trying to treat Sinaloa's violence, although they are insatiable and even more treacherous now.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know the reason, we all distrust."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in Culiacan's capital.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - translated with "Twelve River".
The protector went away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Songs tend to fly freely around in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battlefields of the country, as rivalizing groups fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-piece mouseoles for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of rest if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the fault that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, a interview was published with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivalizing cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have angryed the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skios.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the decree of another newspaper, which had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalistism without struggling at the raid poison problem," said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper deserved a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and the sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-to-passing investigations without fear of censur, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Preis" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
He volunteered to admit that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ marking.
Drugs in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take the task that you like as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in view of so many dead people... why didn't you say what happened?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who could float like a port worker, the friend who was generous with embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar toward the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and live with it.
"You don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret start- and landing paths" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-scensor and self-saving.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "Get a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of luxurious jewelry routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. Days before it was known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-piece building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in the shit, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself described as unreliable.
It has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountainlandscape, where the drug bands are de facto under control.
For the edition of this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on the state expenditure focused on the governor's home city.
And there was a group who executed a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the state lawyer's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the governmental institutional revolution party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high-level cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this area, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source about kidnapping.
"We had already known what happened before," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body statue.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken down."
The office of Valdez was surrounded as a storage room for signs and stickers who protest against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they have never even expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the state lawyer.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.
In all the country, journalists have become more loudly strengthened by writing "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and killing them because they told the truth.
Since then, she has asked for the government to redistribute it because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "umring" of organised crimes, government officials involved and an unfair society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug bands, but also on command of politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with the organized crime.
The Media Guard Group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut up," said Ramirez.
Apparently, the murders have a horrible effect.
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was said to be signed by the Zetas map: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of Correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug cards with a lead article on the cover with the heading "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their country or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in a home in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.
For those who remain back and continue the work, it is a daily dance with riskful decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be poet, admits that drug trafficking scares him.
"Mexiko goes to hell, so I became reporter," he said.
At midnight, the last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat in the cemetery in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to summarize.
A number of shooters with band rivals and security forces near the bathroom site of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cardell messages in the region.
From the board edge, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The cover page had to be changed the next day.
Sirene grew up nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the police, who kept watching to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it.
Among the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"How can you just remember to close," said Bojorquez, "if the same day that Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to report on the street."
Dinosaurs used to deviate their enemies
At the first glance it looks like a statue, although a terrible one.
Researchers have now found out that the first incredible nosehorn of a Canadian miner was received so well that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs".
It was so well received that they could even find that his shoopy skin was of red brown - and they said she had had something of a "crazy past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" referred to him as "the best panced dinosaurs ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurier, which lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the criterion.
His incredible well-preserved state has been surprising by researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the panted plant feeder is the best-preserved fossil of his kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray, north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed wrong from the surrounding rock at the place, and decided to look more closely.
Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years exploring the wild beast within 2.500 pounds (1.100 kg) of heavy earth clumps.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it's been sleeping," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will enter the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have discovered that this plant eater, although covered with a armor and similar to a walking panzer, was probably threatened by meat-freshing dinosaurs.
The highly panted dinosaurer used a red and white tanning to hide from robbers and used a protective technique known as counter-shadow, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to interfere better in his surroundings and deviate to his enemies, experts say what suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature of the Nodosaurier family has made a headline in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild beast and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours in exploring it carefully.
The amazing maintenance of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of shoes and equipment over his body.
They discovered the conter estimation, a widespread defense method in the animal empire, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the conter estimation is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the size of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaurian was hunted with sufficient pressure by meat fermenting dinosaurs that evolution favoured the distortion of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the conter estimation - think of rehe, Zebras, or belt animals - are much smaller and harmfuler than prey, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Stark's robbery behaviour on a massive, highly panted dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs' robbers must have been in the crown time," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence about his life, including its preserved darm content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, came into a river and was driven out to the sea, where he was sank on the back to the ground of the sea.
At that time Alberta was as warm as South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far more in the country than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved skin but also maintains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early crown time.
You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just screw a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's sleeping."
The crown time was a time when huge theropods, meat-freshing dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the panted dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearful ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
The scientists whose most recent findings appear in the newspaper Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was weakened and mummified in the mummified mummed after the death of the sea.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray, north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-painted dinosaurs, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snauze to the hip.
The creatures were averagely 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that pulled from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the panted plant eater was swimed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaurian underwater reception preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The stoned remains of this special exemplar are so well received that the skin residues still cover holprie panter plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of maintenance is "sold as a profit in the lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confused it becomes.
The stoned remains of the skin still cover the holprie panter plates that wear the skull of the animal.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are sprayed upwards.
I can count the shoes on his soil.
In the thread: Mass Karam companies on A8: Many injured
Heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8: Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass caram companies.
There are many injured, mile - and gaffers.
At the Stuttgart-Münch motorway (A8), about 20 people have been injured at a mass caram company late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police's first information, by 5:00 a.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) connections were almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks.
The exact number of injured persons was not available at first.
It's about mild to moderate injuries, said a police speaker.
A great deal of rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was fully locked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a 10 kilometers long remnant was formed.
As one AZ reporter reports, there was also massive disabilities on the counterway - by many gaffers.
The firearm recorded the marks of the vehicle lensers, which now have to expect sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45 p.m., another second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue shepherd was on the way to the accident site.
German Bahn: Group tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone's ever experienced: Nothing in mind is sitting in the train and sleeping.
Or you're deepened in your work and just have a gentle thought.
And then: pufff.
Comes the creator and awakens an unpleasant or pulls the passenger out of the workflow.
Vehicle control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the universal vehicle control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and thus deprive the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"Come on the offer, we extend it.
It will then be expected to be available on many further distances in Germany early next year," said a train speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" the train calls the car card devaluation without creators.
To be able to use them, however, some conditions need to be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what the majority of passengers are doing.
It must also be bought via the app of the train that DB Navigator bought, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And at last you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You rise in the train, call your ticket under "My tickets".
In the case of the test customers, an electronic devaluation button appears.
The train managers will receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train manager arrives at the map control, he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which is to use the passengers again.
"Who wants to travel through our train accompanying personnel without ticket control, just checks in the DB Navigator itself.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personally on the train," says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernverkehr.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to deal with the individual customer needs".
Anyone who often drives train knows that, besides delays and missed trains, the driving card controls are one of the biggest troubles.
Because often you have yourself, but in any case one of the travellers do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the personal certificate or any other document you need to provide.
The result is endless discussions between trainmates and passengers, which leads to poor mood in the division or large space and delays in control of their own tickets and takes the creator at the end time to take care of other concerns.
Still, only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that is only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart dinner.
Other train numbers on the same route are not activated yet.
How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Who Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and rolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stole over a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said there.
As no one else had sent the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweet on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was involved in the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old man who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., lively.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," said Ferrell.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put her phone off to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police band and people who screamed, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who had a sign with the note: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a calling dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman unsured his gun and cried, "I'm going to kill you... animals all."
"This is not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we used to and we can typically call."
At that moment I felt castlefrost.
I was angry and weeping."
She built a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 o'clock, she picked her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the cinemas from 11.
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of people who live in the community and have filled the streets in order to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown, the two talked about a conversation that they had many times before this morning "over the black experience and the black condition".
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her," said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a peak of what happened in the past.
She must know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activity and organization, but also know the various layers of black experience and black Constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience exclating racism, she is not different from the next black woman kid.
I feel like I would show her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place toward the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-acquisition of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activity for Ferrell began to adopt shape.
"My activity has changed totally after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organising.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met during a evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-regisseurs of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were just trying to document what happened.
A question came to the mind of Ferrell: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepticism was eaten by many cases of human beings, often from whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already worked together with the co-regisseur Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism about death tractors.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, the team followed by "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary film is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We talk," said Davis.
"This was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because so I will be presented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - in order to show that the movement was "not a Messiah leader, but a community that meets," said Folayan - she proved to be the openest participant of the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life show how she loves herself and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I have understood that there must be some harm in this work and in the managing of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black-sweep women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, have influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, are identified as gay.
"Black, cheerful women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting at different fronts.
Black, cheerful women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it claims that "this is not an affirmative type of action", where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to its identity.
"She was the person who refreshed this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence, although she was at the front, because in a life on these crossings, a black, cheerful woman is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racic links between the municipality and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on award for 21⁄2 years due to the blocking of a motorway during a demonstration.
She describes the social policy atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home "a chaos".
Nevertheless, she climbs to a song and feels obliged to remember this since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Traum" to "Great Wayne": TV reader discussing bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the footganger zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold doesn't leave the topic one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While they say to the bit-galery, "It would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "It would be really classy" (Nicole skulptors), comes from the other side: "Don't take any man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simple: "Lars Scholz".
While the supporters build on a gallery dragging more customers into the city, of which the other businesses also benefit, the opponents fear that the footballer zone then bleeds out.
In addition, the gallery is planned precisely on the property on which the farm market hall, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
This will end with the start of the construction work.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and go to the Beda platform with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farmers are always very happy.
We also discovered the Metzerei for ourselves.
We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to keep this offer upright.
In other cities there is this too.
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "When direct marketers are sitting in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of the rent reaches.
But it should not be just low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Where are shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find it overbound.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is much more important that we at least stay at the market hall.
Because the product offered there is fresh, mostly directly offered by the producer and is priced above three.
As you see, shops in a shopping centre are only hired by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Damage, special businesses are almost out of the way, and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit for me together.
And the gallery doesn't match Bitburg.
Especially: Where is the farming market hall going during the construction time?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even on a permanent basis if the bit-galery is actually coming.
Or does the sponge bit-galery already make it possible to drive all businesses from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It's just not going to work.
And a shopping center that's empty doesn't need anybody either.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farming market instead of this gallery.
But for a farming market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - there are no more senseless construction projects in Bitburg.
When the farming market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."
An appropriate similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery room in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown that are almost unnoticable - that hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the cuts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former Secret Service Analytics infringed a 35-year-old prison sentence after she made a secret diplomatic report on WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition opened on August 2nd is called A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transfrau and dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithmical analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as anyone could look like with these genomical data, sharpened, though also some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also the identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six breaches of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one picture - a grain-white, black-white self-fie, in which maning was clearly inappropriate on a driver's seat and wears a platin-blonde perücke - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of foreigners from forensical artifacts such as cigarettes and rubber by extracting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artists and her imprisoned museums became uneven lettersfriends, who exchanged several letters over two years.
They even created a Comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would transform and could see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama would in fact only a few days after the book was published, demand Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against intellectuals from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, twiny paths to escape the stare divisions he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the weird Timing of all these things, she said that "that happens for a certain reason".
In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with its large signature below (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) demanded an end of the "automatic breakdown, whose foundation has been sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand football of Cs and Gs and As, is written in leadstift.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all by the involvement of the 200 letters (or nucleotides following the highly developed scientific literature of the artist).
"What people hopefully will take from it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, too.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition that is stored in a private room is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears with a freephone in the hand from the disciplinary casinos of the United States like King King.
"If they colden your speech, they won," it says.
"Never keep your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia.
"I still get gansheat when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if she should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomical simulations that are together like horns of protesters.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 "2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplo groups were written with leadstick.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of people," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford for killing
A country-wide human hunting is underway for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who is searched for as suspects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been engraved with fatal injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) warrants were issued for murder because of their claimed participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Office Court of Cook County show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority indicates that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead in the place of the event, and detectives investigate the boots as a murder while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an outstanding professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University Relations, said in an e-mail declaration that Lathem was now admitted and had been excluded from joining the Campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter, which is examined by the competent authorities, and the Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior Treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker at the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail explanation that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and willing to help the US mediators in every thoughtful way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he urged the suspects to take up the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate it are strengthening," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a ridiculous tip that said that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place also on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants: "The police are currently working on the timeach and the background of the victim and explore a variety of motives, including a possible home event."
"We will complete the WADA driving plan in the near future" - the Russian Vice-President Mutko
The Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a certain stage of compliance with the criteria of the driving plan, RUSAD has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA driving plan was updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA's driving plan to comply with the code describes the criteria for the re-installation of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to worry.
"All things were announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on claimed State-funded dopings in Russian sports.
As to the matter, Mutko said: "We carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no public programmes, and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Mutco's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
Nobody wants to accept this report unconditionally," added Smirnov.
In November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the WADA from the implementation of doping controls in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the headquarters of the Organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be re-established.
Aldi does not sell eggs before
This was notified by the company groups.
It is a pure precautionary measure that no health damage could continue, said the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fipronil-containing anti-electrics.
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency in its customers.
The startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employees' luck at your e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software with the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to carry out surveys, address specific groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow Whistleblowers to deal with C-Suite leaders and direct to the Management Board.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Rerett said that they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.
In addition to the snap-up surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows on a glance which units have most complaints and which leaders have low consent results - so that you can navigate, why.
Companies come to see that you need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber that has been involved in Skandale since an ex-worker has published a blog mail that describes a environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a luxurious business option.
Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion value in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Fall in miscredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send tailored "Puls" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and see the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that employers can report bad behavior.
And if the main manager is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and manager of Convercent.
If a company is found that is ill-treated or unethical, it can experience expensive consequences by consumer boykott, employee flow and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have a simple way of reaching their business centre.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company centre, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.
Well, since the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by leaders who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, infringement or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed faster.
"I can get closer to this wholehearted 360-grade view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after the bookkeeping company Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical infringements through the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.
But it took until the "Social Media came to their right" that companies realized that you couldn't prevent their dirty washing to go online.
"From the use of technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charges companies with returning fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thus increasing the entire capital to $47 million.
Glashers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than before.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only inputs.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that belongs to their voices and that the work you do is worth it, they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both convercent and Glint.
Investors reach remuneration when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If the Analytics Tools promise third parties to increase commitment and employee use, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on the employee engagement is important to the experts in the employment culture.
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or at all not, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have relied too much on the collection of data.
"For if you won't follow employees, ask yourself, "Have you really heard me?
Do you care about that?
And who you don't care about, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so Rerett.
And after the collection of feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long term this will lead to a better bonding of workers in a industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It goes on at 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus.
Some have pulled out their tricotober parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camper.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are registered at the summer courses will return to their final tests after the three-hour exercise before returning to Waterman Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
"This is a real tretmill for the boys the next three days," said Bruins Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 19:15 p.m. to meet the player's already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the browns moved the beginning of the camp nearly one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras' six playtimes in Westwood performed practical exercises.
They should be held during August 18 exercises. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their date against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported NCAA's change of rules, even if it adds another point to the player's many business routes.
"We put this huge burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they've just pressed it, they're placing on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, in view of the clear perspectives of its fields from a nearby parking area and the nearing Luskin Center, a hotel of the raised class, which has already been cast with footballs, which have cleared a protective network behind a gateway, will not be a easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it is not far removed to think that people hire a room there and then set up to record a exercise.
If you have the video tape from an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
That's why I don't worry too much.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify facts verification in the fight against false news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third-party verifiers and then show their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to fight the so-called Fake News.
In an opinion on its website, the company said that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false messages and send them to fact auditors, which may show the results of the fact testing from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called Fake News, many of whom believe that they have also influenced the US Presidency elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters in front of the presidential elections in May overflowed with false stories, and Germany supports a plan to be punished after the social media network, if they are not able to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that a test of the new fact review was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"After the knowledge of the stories of fact reviewers of third parties, people want more context to make founded decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the "connected article" and work on other changes in its news feed to reduce false messages.
Creation of a Comic Roman: a Castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the small Scotney Castle was in a Squeeze music video and was a slup hole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaary Yorkshireman with a favorite for historical documents.
"I like to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says hurtfully.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documentes the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotionally.
"I only responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobines," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters are always smelling for smoke, for at that time a fire was burned for the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if it was himself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who has been so hit with old papers that he is supported by National Trust and Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have a little overevaluated my welcome"), this seems all too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the weightorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyene heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape careers, gardeners and sometimes also to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
The intime history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as "Hunderd of years in which aristokrates said "Oh, throw it on the roof."
Daybooks, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent who had something: "You might think land conflicts would be bored," says Rhodes, "but there was a bear to fight the two families.
Kids, let all go his way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pop into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labour', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farming rebellion of 1381.
"There is a record of a rebellion that appeared in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The farming rebellion began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe they're connected to each other?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit pater who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, represented his own funeral by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery made only years later when his sarg was buried out).
Darrells are the Rhodes'Lieblingsfamilie of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty gauners, to make debts again and to spend money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crisiss by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to acquire interconnection."
After the end of his operation in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He left a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic roman over Elämannmäki, the land of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been requished back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like, "Ach, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf hiding
With the shelter of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roofmark (Donderdag's Roundschau).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a peak of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?" asked the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't think that (naturally!) really," they write on their last released website.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
We are fundamentally convinced that as a bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is true to form a single promise, one that gives the city an indispensable unique feature."
Finally, they are in competition with other municipalities.
A average five-digit amount can be charged by the city of Bad Honnef with its new roofmark and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of army
Each year at the beginning of August in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and transportation in the official corps.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the pocket attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but at the office of the Prime Minister.
Under the presidency of the Head of Government, the five vice-presidents and the Ministers for Defence, Internal Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the discussions.
The civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government attracts the slopes in the military.
Head of General Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the marine were suspended.
Since the failure of the coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the series of the army - mostly because of supposed connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a wire trainer of the putch attempt.
On 486 people who have been directly involved in the pocket attempt have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the Putch, Erdogan had called the attempt to refrain as "God's gift", as he gave him the opportunity to "refine the forces completely".
But is Erdogan really in charge of the army?
At the end of February the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unpleasant in the military headquarters".
In the General Stave there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the renewal of the headwear ban on soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
The great cleaning of the army and the security forces are going on anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan made other 7395 civil servants fire by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan tempted the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the real men of the country.
Three times they appealed to their role as guards of the world government.
After his 2002 election, Erdogan step-by-step pushed back the power of the military, not least calling for the reforms of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan treiber is aimed at the islamization of the forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" a namely unnamed officer warned, seeking the pocket attempt of fear of persecution in abroad asylum, the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, such development could not cause the NATO to be cold.
There is no doubt in the Alliance after the cleaning of the Turkish army's willingness to use.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "saved," says Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides for a reduction in legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules for the obtaining of visa for a temporary working permit and limitations for family-oriented visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft legislation will be discussed in the two Chambers of the Convention.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way the United States' citizens from other countries are spent Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
The Ministry wants to sanify route for Rennsteigshuttle
The future of the race-steigshuttle has been struggled again over the past few months - now it's supposed to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is planned to be built on the marijuana route on which the tourist train runs.
In order to ensure the future of the race-steigshuttle in the long term, the Ministry of Transport has stated that construction work on the route is still to be started this year.
"With the decision to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is acknowledged to this link, especially important to tourism," explained Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of restoration of the route amounted to around 2.5 million euros.
From this sum, the country overtakes 75 percent.
The Treaty on the basis of which the shuttle will also be ordered by the country in the future is currently finally voted, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and the South-Thüringen Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"This means that the driving plan, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The proposed contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be concluded for an eleven years.
For this purpose, the Rennsteig-Shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular train between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations, especially for tourists.
During the course of a pilot operation, the last few months had been tested whether the route was used by enough people to order them regularly in the future.
The route is also highly constructive in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it.
Just as you thought it couldn't be more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots will come.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are now a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emerited professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of chest wrist and the type of fingernail.
"The people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report.
Modern sex pups have developed from their spraying partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" its robot according to his convictions and select everything from the robot's eye color over the shape of chest varts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing because many robots have the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex pups have developed robots with a silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find attractive, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex-Robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which brings the impression of hypocrisy and "Wild Wendy" with an "obviously" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible," the website of True Companion weakens.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods over the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fitted on conversation, or she can be "in mood!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subjective female properties, the suggestions on rape, when you go a step to Frigid (this is: contradictory) Farrah, worry you most.
On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just keep a different sex toys.
Their origin and its increasing raffiness point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as an optional grant.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they remain provisionally at the edge of consumer culture.
But what passes through from the border zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not weird or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has presumed to have attacked women sexually.
The most terrible aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of Magd') is not the graphic pictures, the swelled body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but in the moment this does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, at the point when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can't separate yourself from your companion or just go away.
They have no compilation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
Otherwise, you are pleasant slaves.
Or to express it in the way of 2017: Service Girl
Trump's great performance?
He makes Mitt Romney a part of the healthy human mind
It has become a conscience of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US election have also split families in small formats.
There were newspapers in the United States around Christmas and the crop festival with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump relatives.
We're all supposed to stick to our filter bubbles.
The power of Trumps to bring families together is less noticed.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed poet, who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, has visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican family with whom she had struggled for decades because of politics, is suddenly and very strange on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I find it in a further context that this also brings significant risks.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disappointing effect of his Presidency has the power to move us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and "trump", we refer to the horrible possibility that his girls will no longer kick us off one day.
However, there is an even more terrible long-term scenario in which the Trump Republican of the right wings "normalizes", which suddenly appears as an ingredient of reasonableness compared to its standards.
I find myself encountered by an active nostalgy for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy one - the dog on the autodak, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked) - which both were actually a very mild crime compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans only needs to be spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immense improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the Carussell in the Central Park, the largest carussells of the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a coffee.
The horses are huge, the fiber glass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are clowns and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music brings this in a strange way.
So many clichés a city disappoint: The views of high buildings become old, the Skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be justified to the dream.
Five and thirty years later, and I'm still not all over the day when I discovered that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large circuit in the north of London.
However, the Central Park Carussell is still a strange magical experience, as two years of age, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carussell, I would have given him the full score, but luckyly, no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced in a shop to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% drinking money - this to buy something over the store table.
This leads not only to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also to exercise pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation in which no need is necessary.
The poor woman in the shopping house stood excitingly laughing while I was tired of reaching my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved to the hospital with chest pain from prison
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuttings to his handles, which he said he suffered to prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal of the state lawyers against a first death sentence.
He killed the Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shot them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly invader who hid himself in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to present this time against the six-year penalty of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too negligible.
The National Criminal Authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk that his punishment will be increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth dressers were released from Fütten and Epfenhofen to the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the graduates will go to the gymnasium, four to the real school.
The school director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental Citizenship in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, headed by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle, who grows up in the chicken court, but then released into freedom.
For this purpose, the gentle lady brought a musical with the title "The Adler in the chicken court".
Bauer Arnold found a remarkable egg, and let it out of his chickens.
Instead of a chicken pants, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him broke, and the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and turned away.
Afterwards, the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's study.
The chickens danced with the young gockets, the cylinders wearing, to the bets.
The eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.
Although the virgin animal is different from the other virgins (cows), it belongs to them.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every four graduator that he felt accepted in his new school.
It was followed by thanks to the colleagues, former school director Michael Müller, who repeatedly enters at classes, and the parents' representatives.
The chick time was now over, explained the class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
After two years of lesson, she was very unhappy to leave her students because it had been a really great time.
Finally, she could have relied on the fourth dressers.
To the end, all students made a song of summer time and holiday.
There was great joy in the children.
For the new school year, eight first-learners have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted from television, reported.
On the morning of August 1, Sithonia, the police arrested a group of illegally counting people, including the two bulgarians.
The same day they were released, while a study is being conducted.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have intensified control over the free camping and put significant penalties on all those who are found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court could impose a penalty.
Software Updates for Diesel Vehicles: What the affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should Diesel drivers participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the behaviour of cars of emissions categories Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin by the ACE Auto Club Europe estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The compulsory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their reconstruction has arranged the power station (KBA).
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the next months, but no exact date has yet been mentioned.
Daimler has told us to write to each affected person.
If there is any inspection, it will be done in their framework.
How long should all the equipment be drawn?
"Swere to say," Smetanin says.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
"For we have seen, the automotive manufacturers haven't acted on the environment until now."
How long will the update take?
The reconstruction itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
Time-builder could be getting a date.
What do car drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
Probably foreign producers would retract, so Smetanin.
Are we threatening a massive price loss of Euro-4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where driving bans are threatening.
In the rural area there is no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the pricing don't want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) gets one of the desired awards of the renowned Kennedy Center as the first rapper.
As announced on Thursday, this year singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the Carmen de Lavallade choreographs (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honors.
The awards will be delivered at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, the US President Donald Trump will arrange a reception and participate in the rental together with his wife Melania.
Lear, known with progressive TV series, already announced that he should not participate in the Gala.
The New York Times said: "This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the art and human rights - even to dismiss the resources - and that is a burden on me."
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her views.
The Kennedy Centre, named after the former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Among the former prizemakers are Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city lifeworthy
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city building champion, is going to retire in the next year.
The body is already written out - suitable candidates are, however, rar.
For 31 years, Wacker has been city building champion.
And the work still makes him a lot of fun, as he's presenting in the press talk.
He reports of varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers.
At the same time, he wonders that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the nearest possible time.
This means that, taking into account the regular notice periods, there will be enough time for the operation.
Since Haslach acts as a sub-building authority for the administrative community, the applicant must provide the relevant conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they could no longer fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Openburg for advice.
But nearby citizens are important to the city and to him himself, Wacker, who reports about a good operating climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, some important projects have been collected, which wackers look back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the construction office and his employees.
But also in the future, varying projects are on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla-Areal and the Niederhofenparkplatz is about to be encountered.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bolllenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stage is still the subject.
Only the latter will be put to book with around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my followers.
The work here is fun."
Spiritual is available for a city building champion.
With Haslach's own building and gardening, many things can be reacted quite flexiblely.
"You can move a lot," Wacker said, and the design of green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is under monumental protection, it is important to have a "eye for what fits purely" when new buildings are approved, the separating city building champion emphasises.
Withouthint, the city building champion has a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "at the end everything goes over my table."
In the case of care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been present for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.
Also that his follower remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
For continuity is not only important for a good operating climate but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to provide a completed study as a diplomatic engineer or bachelor with a special structure of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and planning.
The City Building Office is subject to high and deep construction, construction management, basic employment issues, management of urban property, urban farm with construction and urban gardening, as well as under construction laws, including monumental protection.
Bicycle on lines thrown: South Railway locked
According to the police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad transfer in the field of Leobener Road (B116) on the lines.
These were so severely damaged that the approaching cargo had to be stopped.
The mediators go from two male killers and have been looking for them since night hours.
Near the place of the crime had been observed by witnesses by a rose roller and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a Lausbubenstreich," said ÖBB-speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The person or the offenders would have put themselves in great danger and also threatened the traffic.
In addition to the damage to the closure and the plant as well as the delay minute and the cost of rail replacement traffic, the train customers could also have access to the deactors.
Overall, the speaker said that it should go out of a "superior" sum.
The damages were re-established on Friday afternoon, the railways on the southern railroad could be carried without disabilities.
Nearly ten personnel trains were out of the Friday morning, two of which covered television.
Trails did not fall out, but they had delayed.
According to ÖBB-Speecher Christoph Posch, some 200 meters of upper lines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to reduce IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products could reduce the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The unhealthy state, which affects about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, causes stomach cramps and bleeding, returning or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the affected are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products in order to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote an tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrouillating in the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced from cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harmful tissues.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory intestinal disease.
In experiments, a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell has been found in mice carrying a particular bacteria in their inhabitants.
And the bacteria needs Tryptophan - one of the building stones of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacteria type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the darm microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich diet of Tryptophan toleranter, less inflammatory darmmilius if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoktor Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the darmcrobioms of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the stomach drum tractor.
The domes of the mice were sequenced DNA and six bacteria types were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Muses were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a darmcrobioma and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - to unresistant immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-producing cells.
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be an additional product of the Tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the traptophane values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-producer cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach drum tractors.
It is not known whether tryptophane additional products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high teptophane levels at the present of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a genius with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic signed a genius, Jose Mourinho believes, after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds signature by Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last presaison game, before the UEFA Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the Holder-Rolle, when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira pre-arranged for popularity.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues' Preparatory Assia Tour and created only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
Besides Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva city when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he claimed that the club had already done a "fabulous work" to fulfil three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three of four, thanks to the association," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've made great effort."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing started in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved over the United States in the form of a dreamliner, which are several thousand kilometres.
The action took 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens, the form of a dreamliner was to be.
The whole was a persistent test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such advertisements.
So the number was painted "787" and the Boeing logo to heaven.
New Depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD-Chair, social-democratic Prime Ministers always looked at elections with some concern to Berlin.
If there were no storms from the party centre, just no opposition from the covenant - then the most important desire of the election fighters was.
Since Martin Schulz's leadership, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt House have seen the events in the SPD-regulated national capitals with growing disappointment.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach.
They were depths.
And one after another.
The Federal CDU, after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, sees a general signal against the coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red Green can't simply rule reliablely," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany (RD).
The surprising part-session of a Green Member has collapsed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country-day election, his red-green coalition lost its one-stimm multiplier to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Greenen-Bundesgeschäftführer Michael Kellner has invited the abstinent Dutch Greenen Member Every Twest to return their mandate.
The violation of the CDU means a clear distortion of the chooser's will.
Each Twest must return its mandate immediately," said the Federal Business Manager and the Greens' Chairman of the Greens to the editorial network Germany (RD).
"It must not be true at all," says a SPD fighter, when the new Job message reached the party center on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Niedersachsen, is there after the violation of the Green Members Every Twest to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crisiss in SPD countries associations.
And nobody knows what's next.
The Misera began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland Val in March.
A blue eye, no more, calm down the cooperatives at the time.
After the landday elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It was then - and everything became significantly worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite slaughtered the party.
In the weeks afterwards, the cooperatives reappeared hardly.
Then, when they had new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him the next depth came.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD Head of Land, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmony while his city burned.
And because in the crisis communication afterwards he made so pretty much wrong everything you can do wrong.
Since then, Scolz has struggled for his political survival.
So now Stephan Weil too.
Because of the VW gas industry and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
These survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just why, because in the past weeks, because they were increasingly trying to put in the covenant accent.
The attempt of the former Mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin also remained not hidden by cooperatives in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They gave him as they promised for a Stabilisation of the Party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Because at the inter-party tvist of the Dutch Greens is not in fact guilty.
And Schulz hasn't at all.
In some cases the cooperatives strive to keep their own lines closed.
Their anger is directed to the Greens, and above all to the abstinent parliamentary colleague Twesten.
"It is impatient and democratic harmful, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests on the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of party links in the SPD Bundestags Group, the editorial network of Germany (RD).
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament, not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the country list of the Dutch Greens, according to the Dutch Member.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Head of the SPD Bundestags Group, complains to a "and-democratic manoeuvre".
"The voter's will was clear four years ago: the people have made Stephan Because they are Ministerial President," says Oppermann, who leads the Dutch SPD as a top candidate to the Federal Day Election, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the electoral outcome," Oppermann continued.
He asked to explain the backgrounds.
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funds for local cereals III
Anyone who wants to sanify his house in the years can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG informed city development on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a reflection on what has happened.
Since 1991 there have been renovation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Baden-Württemberg country took over two thirds of the total amount of funding.
In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For shindlers, the sanitations in the past are a "resulting project" - it is finally important to promote internal development, not only new building areas.
On April 4th, the presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a renovation area III.
The sum of the aid amounts to EUR 833 333, of which 500 000 would be from the country, the rest of the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a renovation area now arise?
You will continue to investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role to sanify whether there is any interest in the planned area.
If necessary, the borders of the region may also be re-established.
The STEG retired on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Countries Programme "Social City", in which the sanitations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of interior cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out objectively, i.e. per land.
The renovation area would then be established as a statute.
The granting period for the funding has run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September of this year, the recording would only be carried out in the context of which the participants in the renovation area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, the Statute's decision is to be taken as far as possible so that the sanctions can be initiated in the next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that every municipality had to carry out the preliminary investigations.
It is about to evaluate urban abuses and decide when to be renovated and to what extent.
It will then also be entered in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come to receive again and make a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a major success factor for the project was the involvement of the participants.
That is why there will be questionnaires that can be sent postally to the citizens in the coming weeks and filled out to the end of summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and landbow", which includes the constructional state and the renovation purposes.
In the grey questionnaire, the "containment and housing book", information can be made on size, division and residents of a living room.
The blue "operative bow" should be filled out only if the building is operated in business rooms.
However, Gotzel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time.
Furthermore, reconstruction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funding is working according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, paints first.
You can't retain funding for later "reservation".
In conclusion, further photos of the project "Place Carnacle II" were shown to make the attendant a "smart" renovation.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the small chip between thumbs and point fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a consulting Anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is conducted according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, everything for a cost of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built up both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on tax.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayers thousands
The White House's decision to fly a marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American production in the last month, taxpayers cost up to 24,000 US dollars, according to the information of the military left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Vice-President of the White House made a round of products from all 50 countries.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a firearm car from Wisconsin and a mississippi giant.
The White House's Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware, because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of HMX-1 on the evening before the event of his supervisor, the Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation.
The news showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 a.m. for the event at 15 o'clock, and remained until the race was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 a.m. that evening.
The note adds that, if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the service hours, a second team would be required for return.
The original flight crew was at the event with the helicopter, while the security staff of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane.
The records provided for by the TIME did not clearly show whether a second crew was finally required.
The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could injure the destination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"It sounds like you're locked," replied the Deputy Commander.
The event "Made in America" was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political upper tones.
At the event, the President induced the reform of the health reform, which was underway in the Senate, and propagated the efforts to impair government legislation.
The use of the plane known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.
But demanding their use for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted a study in February when the President's plane carried out taxi services in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the President's plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic by the show "Made in America" - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said Lindsay Walters, Vice-Presse Secretary of the White House.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to cancel the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimeter rates.
When Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an official.
Helicopter units flew 11 hours on this day for "Non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took the burden for none of the other receipts presented at the event.
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in postponing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the President's flights and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event.
However, according to hours rates of the US Defence Ministry for the financial year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour.
Recordings of the unit record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
"The costs for taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates are most misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual resources."
According to a RAND study from 2015, the refund rates for DoD do not include the staff costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contractual closure.
At that time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked inadequately.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his round over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a firearm car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and screwed with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss for tricky task
The second tennis-Bundesliga's top ride is at the Tabledritte Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss arrives in Kiel tomorrow at 11 o'clock at the tabled searchdorfer SV.
In spite of five parties, the second Tennis League's top ride has still been given the sense of reality.
Team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Right on the rear positions I find the team very good."
For class and stability at the Searchsdorfer SV, mainly imports from the high north.
"Their dances and Finns can even refer to the Davis-Cup's interventions.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finnland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Søren and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"It's gonna be hard for us as always.
You also need a good portion of luck."
The new team for the trip in the high north stands practically.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If it does not bring it to the Bundesliga Party at the Challenger Tournament in the Italian Biella, the Zdenek Kolar (Tschechia) who is currently playing in the Czech Liberec tournament comes to its first operation in this season.
The Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo, who had been unconquered, was still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball yesterday with the Whiterussen Andrei Vasilevski.
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandsc help, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at Alster, Máté Valkusz could also get back to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, which was still the number one of the Junioren world ranking list in January 2016, someone from the trainer staff around Marius Zay fills up the box.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not really work when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law on the strengthening of sanctions against Russia.
"In his urgency to adopt the law," the Congress packaged a few "constitutional irregular rules", he said.
The Moscow reaction was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels swept against the U.S. proposition.
Nevertheless, the draft proposes to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the domestic OMV, together with other European companies, have been concerned with the construction of the Russian East Sea Guide Nord Stream 2.
The threats are huge.
Nevertheless, it would be too early for an estimate of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump had to bring the sanctions to life by executing order.
Twelve weapons are for his choice.
"The press" has looked at which the group could resist and who could really hurt him.
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is drawn to the center in the heat series of Netflix
Despite the second staffel of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix has not been over for a long time.
The Staffels three and four were already confirmed by Streaming Service, the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad weight of the show.
With the third staffel, the DEA has focused on the richest organization of the world’s drug trade: the Cali map.
According to four powerful patriarchs, they operate "as a Fortune 500 company" only with more governmental decorations and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, who invites American and Colombian criminal authorities to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third staffel of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Role backwards: The city sets 46 kitchen aids
The city reorganizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With firm contacts for the children and a assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban children's days.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the city children's facilities (Kitas).
For Sonja Pommeranz, Vice-President in the field of Youth Assistance, this is a good news: "We've all been very happy".
Cooking continues outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooled on.
The city operates in the Crefelder area 46 Children's Day sites, in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch.
During the last year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables, and the needs are growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours in the Kita at lunch," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour care when children stay until 14 o'clock."
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service from 1 September: they warm the foods delivered, supplement them to salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out, clean, dish and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven-grouped facilities - decides over the length of the hour.
"The kitchen helpers now belong to the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"They are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for the Kita management."
Because this is also the case: healthy diet and cooking lessons.
"The children are to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of kitchen power to the team is useful.
For the kids too.
"You have a well-known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the cuisine forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self-request and foreign supply for the city as the most economical, says the press office.
And that, although 46 part-time workers are re-established.
"But these hours do not get so much weight in about 750 people in the education area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
The Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN.
Elections can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, said the Head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, official leader of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be admitted to the Council elections in the provinces. Three women candidate for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered electorate are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said on Wednesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and included in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the Presidency elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has published threats against a election process that are associated with the transition of international fighting actions to a consulting role.
This year, for the first time, elections will be handed over the power peacefully by a democraticly elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan independent election Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered in total of 3.6 million voters.

According to the police's information, the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends on the Kolping Street at 14.55 o'clock because they wanted to phone the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old rejected the request, and continued with her friends.

The duo fled without a sausage.
The two young men could later be arrested by the police.

GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wishes to make sure of the long-term commitment to production in Glasgow in managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVisie.
GMB Scotland said that the company had swept over the future of investments at the Tollcross location.
More than 500 employees work in the work that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea Cookies alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employers and trade union representatives would be "experienced as first" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch leader, GMB Scotland McVisie's urged to "commemorate that funding for the modernisation of production lines would not be predominant".
GMB-senior organiser Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot clarify the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross, our members are deeply concerned.
Generations of families have worked here and the workers are strongly focused on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar of humanly worthy employment in a area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of the Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic production reduction, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie".
One speaker from Pladis said: "The branch leader at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly, since we appreciate the continual commitment of employees and trade unions representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic climate, we continuously checked our businesses - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross location, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the inheritance of Tollcross as a production site. If our operations change at the site, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this."
Did the PSG Barcelona warn before Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not leave in her persecution of Neymar after she has made a offer of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the World Record Attack?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record to more than the double of the previous brand, while Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world's highest-paid professional player. PSG offers wages of more than 5000,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source is near the Catalan board that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG president three years ago of this view?
When Manchester City in 2014 showed interest in the signature of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any association that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, we'll stand in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG medium-field player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.

To an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Lese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because he met a car on his ride, the driver had to depart from a VW Touran and touch the guide plank.
On Thursday night, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW was on the B 215 from Stolzenau on the way towards Lese.
In the area of the local surrounding of Stolzenau, a car met him on his road, so he had to deviate to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guide plank.
In the car, there was cause damage.
The driver of the incoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had pulled over a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident damaged person, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the consuming vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau at Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen Report discharged Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on abuses discharges Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what writer and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on abuse candal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," explained to the German press agency, he expected an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerging Pope Benedict XVI.
It would very much serve the view of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret of their own leaves or their then false assessment of the operations.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized that in the reporting of violence in the domespates, "two degrees" were measured.
With regard to the assaults in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shaming and shameful" acts that must be punished and prevented in the future; however, it is noticeable that the "greed median manipulation" is, according to author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to think that is normal," writes Scaraffia.
Forstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxa also said in the interview with the Bayerian radio: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "slay was a very normal educational means" "to get done with delightful children, like I was one".
She found it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In the context of the reports on abuses, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Feel wrong, writer and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorial band "My Brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," Hesemann says, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he admires the results of the final report.
What is precisely stated in the 440-sided report, which was submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was responsible for informing the Bistum Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatents were abused in the midst of 1945 and early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of transgressions, 67 courtpates were sexually abused.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says: "There is a summary that Domkapellmeister R. used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.
Especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be more intense.
Nevertheless, in contrast to many other accusations, many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore even connect positive memories to him in many cases despite violence."
In the interview Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is discharged.
Mr Hesemann, the 440-side report on the "experiences of violence on protective persons at the Regensburger Domspatzene" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholester and perfectionist, who often became handy when a domspatz did not bring a top performance musically.
How do you become this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages of the report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He is just eight sides dedicated to him, and he is clearly released by any suspicion of compassion or conscience in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside its scope.
It is possible to suggest that it is too late or not to take the first arguments seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by virtually all the respondents as - so literally - "relief", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the wide majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also represents an excellent witness, describes him as "hearted", "beloved", "heartly", "competent" and "understanding", as extremely gracious teacher, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cooks and Bonbons and "everything of grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has also led to angry outbreaks.
That he not only knocked with chairs and threw the key bond on the ground, but also distributed earfishes and drew too cheerful boys to the hair or ears, he has admitted himself years ago, deeply regreted and apologized.
However, to his honorary rescue, it must be said that such education methods were widespread in the period in question, in the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as with teachers.
Do you still know such discipline methods?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a worldly school, a state gymnasium.
Compared with what is actually going on in this report, namely the desolent sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, this are obviously Bagatella.
There you are wondering if it's not more to do with his knowledge and role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media just collapsed on him.
On the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him still work zealously.
But the truth is: the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, much has been reported in connection with the report on abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzens.
Does Georg Ratzinger, in the final report, also put any involvement or consciousness in terms of sexual abuse to the burden?
Michael Hesemann: Very clearly no.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claims to have trusted the dome chapel champion.
Not even the parents were invited.
"I never trusted to talk about it to my father or my mother," said one of the affected representatives of the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in clarifying sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.
If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would certainly have been a co-worker of the offenders.
How, then, do the Domspatzen Schooler Ratzinger's role with regard to abuse?
Michael Hesemann: A student in question formulated it as follows: "In relation to sexual abuse... I see no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had intelligence in time and could have stopped the respective killer.
I think it ... also is really absurd to assume that he is calculated ... Bubes have been more inspired or more clear or opened than to their parents, international leaders, trust teachers, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... - unthinkable."
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students and/or their environment were concerned before him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
So when it comes to sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak from any consciousness.
In this way, he cannot be precluded not to prevent him or have brought him to an advertisement.
Therefore, there is no reason to link its good name with these inevitable crimes, as has unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, there was a lot of "waltexzessen" reading at the Regensburger Domspatents.
The former dome chapel champion Georg Ratzinger is presented in the "Wegschauen" report.
Does he have to live with this presumption?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is, again, a misuse of the report.
Because there is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the domspates, between sexual abuse and violence excesses, and, let's say, other objections.
The report also deals with events from the time since 1945, also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not chor leader of the domspates.
The whole horrible princess pedagogics, the cases in which boys were regularly scrambled and painted by sadist teachers and suffered disgustingly, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pilenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have dominated.
But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys to face only when they were already at the Domspatzen gymnasium.
On that, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the subject "preschool" was tabu.
You were just happy to have escaped and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even "paradies" conditions.
What else was there on the Domspatzen gymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: Although there was discipline, there was no sadistic violence.
And that is just the case with Georg Ratzinger, who concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore even connect positive memories to him in many cases despite violence".
Thus, most of the presumption remains to have looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which the situation in the preschool was reported to him.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just started to set up and the pastes at a school where he was just not working and responsible (so the Witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then not until around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger close the ears consistently before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, for already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this he pointed out that "to continue practicing the penalty in the preschool".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when criminal penalties were already prohibited in Bayern.
Before that, they took place in a legal cruel zone, as everyone of us probably knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected might have overdated or dramatized and where the allowed limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't even say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
Only in 1980 the penalty at schools was officially cancelled in Bayern.
Forstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "fall strike of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The presidency's right.
Of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times and also not to what has been breached in the preschool of oppositions and violence on innocent seels of children, which is far beyond what was normal at that time.
That's all terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ears and to hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also kept strictly on it.
What picture of his Regensburger's time has Georg Ratzinger given in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the topic of penalty also speak?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedicts XVI., tells from his perspective, since the doomspatches played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not swear that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without calling for absolute discipline, it would probably not have been possible for him to form a institution of world priority from the nationally well-known rainburger doomspates, true cultural messengers of Europe and his musical tradition, which went twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and Bonbons alone, there are no big singers and successes from reversible boys, no matter in what area, but always discipline, passion and self-defeat.
As a person, you've experienced Georg Ratzinger in the discussions about their book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really knew Georg Ratzinger very well and repeatedly experienced as wonderful, humorous, solid, deeply believed, and hearty people, of whom you can't imagine that he could only suffer a plane.
I regularly get to know how many former doomspatches are still today, 23 years after his emerging, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
So those who do not forgive him until today that he was once strict to them are clearly in the minority.
Most doomspatches thank him today for enriching their lives and bringing them close to the world of music.
And that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, surely, that could be - but was also a loving person of respect to whom they still look up and worship them right now.
And please, again quite clear: everything you want to do is education methods that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time for a long time.
But it's very unfair, a man, just because he's prominent and has a even more prominent brother to make a median sinbock.
There is the evil intent that stands behind is too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published discharges it.
Now, the claim would be to let a 93-year-old man who acquired great earnings without the outside of Bayern and perhaps nobody of Germany know the rainburger domspates finally in peace.
