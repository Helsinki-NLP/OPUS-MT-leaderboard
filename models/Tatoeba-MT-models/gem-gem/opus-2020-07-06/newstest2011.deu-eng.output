What is she supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, nor the "conditory".
The new masters of the capital of ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has made members of the new Council from the ČSSD a little "cloud" as they dominate the notoric snake that has inhabited in the past years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the Ruder.
The codated vocabulary, which was introduced by the Prague political elite in the elected era of supreme mayor Pavel Bém, has been rejected by some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils showed that these new concepts were dipping somewhat in darkness.
At least they claim that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I'm rather a new person in Prague's policy," Lukáš Kaucký, the new Cultural Councillor, responded to the test of the "Paten-Wordschat".
But also Mr Karel Březina, a political veteran, responded in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfhole".
"That's the only expression of those you present me here that I use. "
Otherwise, I don't like snake.
From the vocabulary, which the journal Aktuálně.cz published in June before the ODS election convention, the editorial picked out six terms, especially those which are notorically associated with the Prague Magistrate.
Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "greatest Prague Golfhole", "go into the conditory", "Stiernacken", "Verrat der Hauptstadt" and "verbals".
Three Prague Councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague School - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even take off the hearer.
The fifth Councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the front.
"These things don't matter to me and how civil Democrats talk together, I don't judge it."
"For me, how we understand ourselves in the framework of our programmes" he commented.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the above headline claimed not to recognize that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-bourgeois Bém, Roman Janoušek, is the talk.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing but Kaucky, and the only term he correctly said during the test was "the largest Prague golf hole".
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, adding to safety: "But I know more about this from the newspaper."
And funny, "I'll probably have to have a language course."
The "Golfhole" is then not only depicted by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Director of the Council for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
Both social Democrats, however, also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even knew where to find this figure and thereby what it means to go to the conditory.
"I think that means going into any Prague gastronomic operation," Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušeks companies.
In line with Březina, however, he insists that he has given these knowledge out of the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
To judge the participants, there seems to be no similar inhabited snake among the social democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there's nothing like this with us."
"We call by name, occasionally we also use shortcuts or nicknames," says the Chairman of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - by his party partner salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that way," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and see - he works.
Ratsherr Weinert is friendly to the parties of the "Opa" or less friendly of the "old", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who made attention to the elections by makenships at party sponsoring, by some colleagues called "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figur).
In this way, nicknames are the only ones that allow social Democrats in domestic language use.
Hulínský doesn't seem to like it when he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague President.
His nickname "Doctor of the Gummiknoble-Recht" claims to do so that Petr Hulínský acquired his title Doctor Juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "Hexen" and gave out a brochure
Women who are stamped to witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They belong rather to the elderly generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are unmarried and have no children.
If one of these women becomes "to the witch", she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Mans are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women remain saving this, as they help and feed children in the work", one Ordensschwester describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home of more than a hundred women who have been expelled by their communities.
The local government now decided to act against this abnormal "social action".
And for this reason gave out a brochure to stop the "hexen persecution".
But the thing has a crack.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper referred to the dilemma of the written information.
But to be accused of witchry is also in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they surpassed them with Petroleum and simply burned them.
The BBC server also reported about this incident.
However, the offenders claimed that the matter would only have been a meeting of unhappy circumstances.
According to your version, oil is flames, which is used for ritual salvations.
And after the group tried to "drive out a wicked spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here without consideration for their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Fresses of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least strives to extinguish the witch hunting, the Gambian President of the President himself has been regularly joining the President last year.
"Präsident Yahya Jammeh, after his aunt's death, discovered a monstrous witch hunting, as they claimed to have a share in their death and now try to kill the president even by black magic."
"He called Shamane from near Guinea to help those who, in conjunction with police officers, soldiers and the President's bodygard, electorally arrested women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the farm of the President in Kanilai," said Amnesty International in their report.
On the farm, the inkirted people were forced to drink a suction of plants with hallucinogenic effect, but which also caused darm and kidney problems.
Two of the armed people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of international pressure, the nearly a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bakala: he warms in the oven - still pays higher rent
An elderly underlying man just leaves the client centre of the company RPG Byte of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rent apartments in Czech Republic.
Under the arm a catalogue with three new rental contracts to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who just ruins a prison sentence.
All three were just increased in the context of the so-called "deregulation" rent.
Instead of 3500 crowns of monthly rent, the son will take over the next year for a 2-room apartment with a kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns.
"And there isn't even hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he tips up with the finger on the new rental contract of the son to whose signature he has a power.
"But something - I signed," he says half voted and half resigned.
The Civil Association ByteokD.cz, which referred to the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral" advises the tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, where it intends to publish a instruction on how to act against such contracts.
But the man just turns off.
"One says this, the other one that," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region becomes the big "deregulation laboratory".
After a new year, this deregulation is ahead of most rental apartments in Czech Republic whose tenants do not pay market-favourable rents.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is full of one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning on that Tuesday.
Just next to the door, the bodyguards of a security agency and a calling device are standing with her.
"Clean 2011", so a special button on the touchscreen lights.
Shortly tipped and the device already spucks out a numbering list.
We have hardly encoded the number "157" and already piep it on the big display on the deck of the waiting room.
Half a second later you're on the row.
Sometime later an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room does not seem to apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and similar.
From mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the Kuverts with the new leasing contracts flats most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio into the letters boxes.
The RPG Byte suggests a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent in writing.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client centre has been opened since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, that's the beginning," the ladies react after a moment when the "Klant" evades as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala's former mining apartments are a brilliant topic.
Before the elections, Parliament's Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek had taken this subject quite loudly, no wonder today the newspapers are full of them.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not once. WC glasses could change them," the man mentioned at the beginning air.
To date, the employees, above all, are on the switch to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised leasing reduction promised to RPG when they sign the special offer in time.
In the benefit of a half-reduced February coin, the other tenants who sign the new leasing contract will also come up until 15 December.
Up to now, however, "Degulation switcher" in Havířov is everything else than overloaded by demands.
"From the 360 clients yesterday, only about 40 to 50 of the rentals in 2011 were here," the switch officials estimated.
RPG offers individual rental agreements, where necessary, both on their websites and wallboards.
However, if the tenants do not agree on the new rent, they are determined by an independent court.
"This is not to be threatened, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on its websites.
"There is no one going to court here," one of the employees of RPG bytey and a man on the street in front of the client centre gives her at least part right.
"I have 13,000 (Crones) pensions, of which I remain 5,000 for dinner, where I should take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee will be insecure.
"See me."
"Her Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign, and so the people are still waiting," they think.
The regulated rent ends most of the Czech Republic to the New Year 2011 and RPG Byte says that the rental increase is an economic need.
"The existing amount of rents is not even sufficient to maintain the residential fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the RPG Byte's home portfolio and - just the negligence of the housing fund criticized by the tenants is the main reason for the rental increase.
While RPG has been able to invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is estimated to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling against the polster seats in the Havířov waiting room, a few red lighting information appears again and again.
"The rental increases in 2011 with 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter and month", is read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increase the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, the increase is extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre", RPG argues.
At 2600 apartments the rent remains at the same height next year.
RPG Bycy promises that the deregulation does not drive the rents jumping upwards but gradually take place within four and eight years.
More - the company has a further commitment: All revenues from the rental increase (see diagram) want the company to sit back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in the heat damping.
But - primarily these are to benefit those who sign the agreements on the rental increase.
The architects saw - the office also belongs to a children's garden
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a minibarn garden with all that belongs to: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outside terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the employees of Arch.Design last year.
The Arch.Design projection and architecture office, from which ateliers come from a number of famous brenna buildings, accounted for the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the spaces for its mining gardens.
In a wiser perspective, because most of his 90 employees (in their own) are in the baby tree age and the company is inclined to return to their work as quickly as possible.
Together with the possibility of working shorter, the children's garden is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social programme.
The construction engineers and architects have so easy to bring their demanding profession and childcare under a hat.
The Minibargarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of management, they managed to win funding funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-children gardens are financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operation Programme from the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (subsidies of 2, 8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment could be obtained and for the duration of 2 years have been provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the exhaustion of the funding (2 years) the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the mini children's garden 3 further years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took place for a whole year, while the Economy Rating Society provided effective assistance in the implementation of the application.
The children care for fully qualified staff - a nurse and a children’s garden teacher, children’s gardens can visit children without an ageal limitation, although most of them are more than three years old.
And since this is about a mini children's garden, only five children may be present at the same time, but the day is changing over several children.
Children's gardening is flexiblely agreed to the needs of parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the children's garden, without regard to the company's hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini children's garden is still similar to the preschool framework programme.
The children play not only here, especially they are given excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool, they also learn English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
At any time, parents can take a look at the children, so the stress is missing when the children get late from a far-reached kindergarten.
The parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder there are also natural and loyal employers' relationships here.
Arch.Design is part of the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in the application of new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programmes.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. See the interiors of Gaudi
The roof mutes in like the back of a prehistoric grain, the stairs like the turbine pillar of a dinosaur and the balconies are ripped fish mills.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants the house with its organic forms got the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Organic forms, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splitters and mosaics, the remembrance facades and all-day soft lines, all these are typical characteristics for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamy lines, delicious colors and textures that remember nature and living creatures.
Only when you look more closely, you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
In the night the whole facade still works plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the glossy of the colors.
The same swinging lines and swallowed forms also dominate the inside of the house.
Welllikely shaped wood copies the window frames, lands, cider elements of doors, even guck holes and performances.
The house Batlló in the Eixample quarter on the live shopping road Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the conversion of a house from 1877 by the architects Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the prosperous industrial Josep Batlló, was originally on the departure of the old building and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to Gaudís' idea of an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, the Casa Batlló rental house did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade were his idea.
However, many other artists and artists also worked in the design of the Fassade.
The joint work on the designs of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in Güell Park, where there are further works from Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the house received from the local inhabitants of his organic forms because of the nickname "Knochenhaus".
Others again called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "like house".
It is also said that at the top of the building the sword of the holy Georg, the cartridge of Catalonia, is represented.
But also other sculpture elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the house for then time with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces.
Something bizarre already mutes her 45-grade density.
In his creation, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations at that time and was not allowed to fail.
Although he had received the appropriate construction permit from the city before the beginning, the information he made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so disappointed from the result two years later when they finished the process that they demanded relief.
Among other things, the councils also supported the fact that construction with its pillars even intervened in the public cemetery.
However, there was no change, quite the opposite - only fifteen days after the call for the city district, Josep Batlló made an application for the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was immediately submitted to him.
The household owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the galaxy on the second floor, there was a company salon, on the third floor, the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was defeated on a jewelry shop.
The entire six-piece building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
By the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and swinged walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern approach to mutual interconnection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors, so a larger society could easily plead without having to refrain from certain intimity in the case of confidential conversations.
The house was received by Gaudís reconstruction except for a new facade also a quite unusual roof and two other floors.
Impressive is also Gaudís game with the light as well as the blue and white glassed tiles with which the interior is dressed and the lighthouses.
The game of these two colors gives a maximum of light to all floors of the house.
He simply made the principle to use that white reflects light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight in the opposite way.
The house Casa Batlló, which was included in 2005 in the Unesco World Heritage List, can visit everyone today.
On the first floor, the spacious and most magnificent apartment is made available to the public.
The owners of the house decided only in the year to this step and this from the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was discovered that this is a fairly insignificant business, the visits were maintained, yes, they were devoted to more common and the roof floors, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building monument is not a cardboard steel, it is 16.50 euros, students, retirors, groups and holders of tourist exhibitions get 20 percent reduction.
This amount exceeds the entry prices at other Gaudí bouts in the city.
If you want to know the real atmosphere of the house with your dragon towers, try to make a friendship with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed roast? Women have other wishes than men
Not the finest bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rose make the good bed out.
However, these must be harmoniously supplemented in order to meet the desires of the specific user.
In the selection, many things play a role - weight, size, health and, not least, the gender of the sleeper.
Similarly, the interior in which mattresses and roses are subjected is also important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where no regular heating is not suitable, latex mattresses are not good because they need much longer to be "what".
In addition, they are significantly more difficult than usual polyurethane matrates.
And - they should be used regularly.
Because if they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and still lie on a fixed plate, humidity is at stake: so it is not excluded that under their fungus forms.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used.
If you have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses are common with soft layers, you will be able to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Would all the yashockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"They simply need a soft layer of Visco sham (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer) for their shielded shoulders, ferses and hips."
"I also recommend that sugar-cranked people suffer from an disturbance in the nervous system so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, specializing in polster furniture.
That's why I've been worried about many yashockey players years ago, but also other customers with Visco Shaum (Memory Foam).
"This is no longer a problem today, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily need to be a famous icockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco shame.
This "wonder" actually works very simple.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise said it is regularly swallowing to the warm body.
Nowhere is it pressured, in the night you don't grow around like after a heavy struggle.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viskoelastic foam also provides protection against Decubitus (Wundbrand).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles, that is, about 21 to 34 cm.
A man like a woman who is sized at the 180 cm needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeve should be available at least 90 cm, i.e. 180 cm together.
For single beds, such as singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
The comforts half and for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bedwidth: "If you're on your back, you should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the champion of the polsters and space utensils, who have been dedicated to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for years and also to professional schools.
At a double bed, everyone needs its own rust and its own mattress, but be careful when buying, so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing remains left but to mount the rose in different heights and this is not long possible at any bed frame.
Shoes should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which should be at least three centimeters on the shape layer and the fine pole star.
"With the hand or at the place, the feathers must not be felt at all," Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Full-cooled beds with mattresses and suburbs like folded siam twins have nothing to look in the bedroom.
These mattresses can't be ventilated and the reference can't be washed what is already running and being.
And since one night you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress becomes slow to a huge (and stuck seven).
That is why professionals reject advertising logs that promise a life span of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee.
Every thing has her case and but.
And therefore, a practical advice from traders: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not scare the hygiene of the washable, removable bearings, yet it is recommended to use a mattress shoeer that you can easily pull off and wash.
Although today typically mattress bearings are manufactured with circular scratch closure, so you get two half after opening (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially carried out alone, is often like the inequal struggle between David and Goliat.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a rose?
Get out of here!
Or most for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
They should also use the plate with ventilation holes (if not already in it) and mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pockets and fine poles.
Polyurethane matrates are not included on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. combinations of latex and cocos) are suitable for non adjustable latten roasts with 14 to 18 feather bars, i.e. 28 and more feather bars, with Lordosen supports in the lender wrestling area and the possibility of regulating the latten hardness.
No mattresses with feather skeleton are included on adjustable lamellen roses, as they do not respond to the ergonomic performance.
Besides setting the steep of the feather bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fixation of the feather bars that enables them to impress or even angle the feather bars so that they can make it possible to point in the shoulder of the sleeve.
For men with broad shoulders a important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "herrenmatrates".
The ladies are also in mind - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, punktelastic wing feeding systems (lattoflex) or rusts are determined with pointelastic contact paths with so-called multitortion fermentation.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too large and filled) head cocks to the right mattress and the right rust, most advantages are lost again.
Here too a fist rule: the head cocks are to support their heads, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm large cushion, such as the Scandinavia.
In the side position, the head cushion (in conjunction with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate the shoulder height.
Something we have in our modern mattresses have been common with the ones (filled with how) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their intersections.
The new magic word "Bio" is also used in mattresses.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, it is used to produce polyurethane shoes more and more often natural oils - such as rizinus and soja oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called for mattresses, which consist of their core of materials purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress bearings - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also take micro capsules that spread fresh forest or lavendelduft while sleeping.
Here you also make a difference between husband and woman.
While a "cooler" plant extract is used in men from bear leaves to absorb the heat and cool the body, the amounts for women have "heating" effect.
Extractions from red paprika shots induce the blood circulation, so the weaker gender gets well warm when sleeping.
What about today's favorites?
Mattresses of cold foam (he has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different steep (heart) of cold shades and Visco trees produces more zone mattresses, which know exactly where the head, hips and hills are located.
However, for a high-quality mattress, you have to take 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aid.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
It's not easy to save on the mattress and the rose.
There are occasionally special offers of manufacturers and traders who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
Thus, the Magniflex brand offers the duofreeze mattress with decorated Visco Schaum Memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets you free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that launched the era of the viskoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at nearly cosmic speed.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to huge overloads at the starts.
Tempur is soft when warm, in cool environment it is reconsolidated again.
Thus it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal not only to prevent pressure fire, but is generally increasing sleep comfort.
But viskoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for other health products, such as for special foot poles to facilitate the legs and vessels.
Domestic manufacturers, for example, use the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have the kids under control
The fear of your own children grows and thus more and more parents consider to monitor them via GPS.
The system, which was originally found to find cars, can be as good as people, which would also be helpful in such cases as recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is now about as large as a cigarette bag, but soon it will not be bigger than a bracelet clock.
Many people have moved the case of the disappeared Anička into fear and fear and thus keeping their children looking out for means and ways to protect them better.
Also for the price of a reduction in their privacy.
"We're trying to say to everyone that it's not about spying around here, but about a effective means of reducing the probability of the tragedy," says Petr Pilin from the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that in individual cases there can be abuse of such devices, for example if you put it in your pocket without knowing about it, but we haven't ever had such a case."
" Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
But he believes that the child should always know what purpose the "bag" serves and how to use it in an emergency case.
However, children's psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child doesn't like to wear such a thing, it simply dissolves him.
"Also very little children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they do not want to be controlled."
"Although the phones at first raised great expectations with the parents, they are as easy to turn off as these new monitoring devices," says Mrs Bočková.
Their opinion is also contested whether such an institution in the event of an attack really helps.
"In planned kidnappings, the kidnaper virtually always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be placed."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were found to be more widely used, they would also seek them, since their sales would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always a step ahead," the psychologists say.
However, it admits that similar devices can be helpful in a sudden attack by a pedofil.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services both for cars and for people, the existence of such a device can also help if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted in such a way that it is reporting the respective position in certain intervals."
"Although it would immediately be destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In more expensive devices, even an inclination meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain unmovable, the device will immediately send a warning with an indication of the position," says Mr Čech.
He believes that similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, but you only need to play a specific software.
The problem of the current location devices is that it is either about devices in wooden box sizes, similar to trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There's always a danger of losing them.
Mr Pilin from the Macro Because, therefore, in present, devices that look like normal digital clocks are tested.
"This has the advantage that any attacker must not at all realize that it is a surveillance or location device.
"Even if he notices what the police give a time ahead," he adds.
No matter in what direction development is going to - to bracelets or trailers, it always uses the same technology as in the vehicle ordering.
So about the combination of location function using the GPS system (like the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many tooth knees that you could reconstruct all the Czech Republic but only two years
The Czech Army has bought 445 kilometres of dental knees, burned with plungers.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defense had delivered 224 kilometres of teeth to the army camp.
It is reassuring to know that the forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the teeth knees - two but not more than four years.
The army bought the tooth core from the STV Group, a. s. for lips 40 million crowns.
In his reason for purchasing this huge quantity of teeth, the General Stave MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometres of teeth.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, MF DNES responded to it, this indication shows that the whole army has to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnical training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and pruning women.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Armegeneral Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way, the remarkable annual consumption of sixty miles [60 km] of tooth corpses was halfway justified.
This length also corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But then these army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies to training every new professional soldier in full, the army has created a calming stock for the 225 years already mentioned, even under the view of the increased need for pioneer and special units.
In this context, soldiers of the rapid input brigade recently complained to Minister Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for hand-fire weapons, so shooting of the missing means is severely restricted.
Quiet from the shortage of subsections.
"I don't understand why they buy such a lot of teeth from us."
But that is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we mostly want to meet as dealers," says STV Group Jan Děcký's sales manager.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defense, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of teeth with this army covering itself for at least ten years with this "munition".
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year use of the teeth and police and army pyro engineers only of two years.
"In perfect storage, the four years mentioned are possible," one of them admits, but wants to remain unnamed, not to be accused of the criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not for nothing but cost more money.
Another argument from the Ministry of Defense is the quantitative discount for the 445 kilometres of teeth.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometres", speaker Pejšek informs us of the position of the Defense Department's buyers.
Only to compare: The annual consumption of teeth cords by police pyrotechnicians, the liquidation of ammunition from World War II or the Soviet brother army has been over 1,500 meters for a few years.
And the police always order only the amounts of this ammunition that they can use before it expires the duration of use.
As a result of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable tooth corpses is also open.
The Defense Ministry still has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of munition from the Warsaw contract, when the two hundred thousand coupling Czechoslovakian people army prepared for their campaign to Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who spoke to MF DNES, the Czech forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old teeth, which she has purchased so "favourable" today.
Until today I find the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition
The victorious placement in the competition "Little entrepreneurs of the year" helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell the franchise of his hotels.
The winners of the last year's competition "Little entrepreneur of the year" became Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success mutes as a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun was happy to travel.
First in abroad, he realized that there is no good night-to-night accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his vacation work in abroad and with a bank credit, he found a building house with five apartments.
Recognizing that he was then a university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous capturing.
"The price-quality ratio at that time was irritating me and so I tried to do something against it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he hired to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the whole profit in the house, which he then gradually rebuilt to the pension with 54 beds.
He has been able to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in just seven years.
The most convenient of them was recently the "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, which we sold our Franchise concept and other interested parties on the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already reported themselves," says the entrepreneur Number One of the last year.
"Great part of this license sale for the operation of hotels just had the victory in the competition "entrepreneurs of the year," Mr. Pytloun admits.
The victory brought him greater knowledge, even popularity in Liberec and the surroundings.
"The people recognized me on the street, often they congratulated me even afterwards, and I have to say that was really good," he recalls.
I really recommend all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't have to win at the same time, any visualization is good.
He says that he has benefited from the contacts and communications that it wouldn't have otherwise come to.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I have regular business relations so far."
He believes that the glory associated with success is a little striking on each of his employees.
And that's where he's got the seventy.
"I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that will be granted general recognition."
I do not really see this as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name has just come to the front," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
My followers I wish a more quiet year when we had it in Farmet
The victory was quickly dissolved from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goals, Farmet has the worst behind itself.
The price for the first rank of the competition Vodafone Company of the last year received Karel  _ _ _ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The jury at that time appreciated the efforts he made from the small tool building in Česká Skalice a company from the ground, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this assessment not only encourages myself, but also encourages all my employees and strengthens our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the company history of Farmet, the effort was to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel Žárský as a compensation for the property conveyed by the communists a small workplace for the pact, he was not hesitating for a long time, left his career in the company where he was busy and founded with a few of his father's companions a company for the manufacture of plastic weapons.
Shortly later, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have risen as the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success of the competition mentioned and its medialisation, it has also entered into the consciousness of non-financial publicity.
"Not only that our customers now see the brand Farmet significantly more intensely, our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country to give greater value," says Karel Žárský.
Last year, however, farmet was not only in the sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at that time was even less shaking the citizens, but especially companies, just reached their peak - many companies had been forced to set up their investment projects and to limit the purchase of new institutions and technologies.
Of course, we could not escape this situation.
"The sales decreased by 40 per cent, we had to restrict production and even take on dismissals," explains Karel Žárský.
A viable company may also have to take such unpopular measures.
But it was possible to handle the situation and to keep the company in the black numbers, even with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to cut off - in investment in research and development.
"From the grant we built a research and training centre, we strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired main prices in domestic exhibitions," says ŽŽárský.
Everything shows that we've overcome the crisis.
The sales grow again and with them also the number of new employees.
"The new winner I wish a lot of joy in the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," Karel  _ _ _ __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A question of opinion which is cleared by unwise regulations
The question of the "absorbity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some unwise regulations have already succeeded in creating out of the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next anniversary of the opinion "Absurdity of the Year", the obligation to create documents on authorities available online.
Thus more than one third of not more than four thousand entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the social security administration requested a paper withdrawal from the trade register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the question of opinion, this is now changing.
"In the future, the Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require excesses from the trade register in the checks of social security payers," said the speaker of ČSSZ Jana Burařová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion survey "Apostacy of the Year" is to take all the regulations and regulations to be taken into account, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to lift the unwise ones.
This is part of a business competition for the fourth time this year, organised by the second economic newspaper (HN) and enjoyed a growing popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, there were four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to impede business activities.
"For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we take a leading position in the world," says Karel Havlíček from the association of small and medium-sized companies and traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activities in recent years is the proclaimed objective of all governments.
However, compared to the world, the situation in Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank's data, Czech Republic takes the 74th rank in relation to the corporate conditions, compared to the previous year, an eight more bad place.
Competition dissurity of the year was called out for the first time in the year and acts each year according to the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic uncle from April to the end of September.
For registration, the web address is www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the contractor selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and allows the public to vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It victories the absurdity that most votes get.
This year's opinion survey has already been reported more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and orders.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finanists" of competition, for example, are provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to pay to the ground or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to provide every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of competition.
The call for competition at the Prague Wenzelsplatz in early November is part of a strike which regularly involves personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, was Eva Sobodová, the director of the Association of Small or Medium Companies and Professionals of the Republic of Tsch. and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commercial Affairs of the Czech Republic at the peak of competition with the party.
"Where the state casts the entrepreneurs between the legs, there can be no real economic swing, so my goal is to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessarily difficultying the entrepreneurs," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create unwise orders from the world show effect.
In 2007, most of the people disrupted the entrepreneurs' duty to report three days in advance to the business office at their permanent establishment in advance to have an exhibition or a Kirmes.
This duty was revoked by a novelle of the commercial law.
The obligation to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Office of Employment Services for up to 30 days - was removed by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdity of 2009, the regulation was elected that physiotherapists had a mirror, a refrigerator and two guards in the speech room.
This Regulation was somewhat relieved by the Ministry of Health this year - the cooling duty fell away.
A new category acknowledges socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sport projects
A new one in this year's fifth year of competition in the economic newspaper (HN) is the category "the most responsible company of the year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair businesses.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the impact of your entrepreneurship on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the Vodafon mobile company, is the caller and guarantee of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year".
For this year's first year of this special subcategorie of the main competition Vodafon Company, companies notified for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspired and fine enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrally with regard to the subject of their activities, their efforts still have a common necessity - support and consideration.
These are, for example, disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among their employees, which then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports types.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, who has been the principal sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady is also an example of their disabled people who are 70 percent of their staff, for which they were acknowledged with the title "The most responsible company of the region Mittelböhmen", and in the competition of Vodafone company of the year, she proved the third rank in this region.
In the region of Olomouc, the accounting company was defeated by MiRyz Soft, which introduced a flowing and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week and this without a relative pay reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly purchases from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in its surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recruit as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our entrepreneurial activity and administration on the environment as possible," explains her manager Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region is again located in the health of his employees, so it has created them to all notebooks ergonomic seats and keyboards, and it also promotes homework in their employees and uses cartering services in business activities, which are provided by a locally protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Distress", which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Not least, the activities of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbader region are noted, which contributes to their pension insurance to their employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We give our employees contributions to the catering, the working path, their qualifications and holidays," says Joseph Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Morais-Schlesian region.
For the category of responsible company of the year, all districtfinalists of the competition Vodafon Company of the year were automatically notified, replying to the questions of the questionnaire attached to the notification and sent it to the organiser at the latest until 15 August.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the assessment by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the contesting companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "the most responsible company of the year" but they were not disqualified in the main competition of Vodafone company of the year."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible because it is only a subcategorie of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman from the organising agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrested at a public invitation
In the building of the Boden Fund in Pilsen, the Anticorruption Police held arrests in the last days.
The local media operator and real estate dealer Luboš G. was dispatched by the detectives in handcuffs.
This person claimed to have tried to manipulate a competitive public competition in order to reimburse refund rights so that the property offered in competition would be subject to a specific interested person.
This would have paid Luboš G half a million for this.
"Then I can only confirm that the police persecute a person because of the delict of fraud in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, head of the Pilsner State Attorney of the Právo newspaper, not to give further details about the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police again.
In order to manipulate public competition, it is only possible to speculate about it in view of the restrictive official information.
The speaker of the Gulf Fund Lubomír Černá pointed to the question of this matter by Právo that the police had actually arrested in the Pilsner side of the ground fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and co-nine about one of our employees," she concreted.
According to the public competition, Mrs Černá had the correct term "Request for tendering claims for transfer of property under the ground law" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons offer a higher value of their refund rights to be paid by the transfer than the procurement property value."
"In accordance with the claims offered, the order of potential acquirers is set, the ground fund then transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the speaker of the Fund.
Luboš G. was obviously available for information who had registered on the request and because he was a legitimate person, since he had purchased a number of refund rights, he offered a property interest to withdraw from the competition.
Apparently against a fat absorption.
This would also be an adequate explanation for the reason why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota Fund, which was criminally persecuted because he issued lands in replacement refunds, which had already been made of site decisions on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. from the Boden Fund also acquired lands intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, in the place where the construction of the access stations was planned to the trade area of Borské Pole.
Later, he exchanged this very favorably with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which exceeded the value of the lands far.
At that time, the city house had to give a heavy heart in order not to compromise the construction project by blocking the property.
The housing costs of households increase by some hundreds of months
From January, the households have to expect not only higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and waste costs, and also for remote heating and somewhere, the rents will also grow.
From January, families will have to draw several hundred crowns more monthly from the portion than before.
Electricity gets up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and somewhere also devour the remote heat supplies.
Only the electricity eradication costs the housing households some hundred crowns more each year.
The strong current prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so it is due to the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely photovoltaic systems.
Although gas only becomes moderately expensive, this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here is a few hundred crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas get expensive throughout the Czech Republic, far heat prices are different from city to city.
Especially larger places plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové must pay more for remote heating monthly up to 50 crowns, more than 1000 crowns more a year paying families in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague again threaten 9 percent higher water and waste and this in case the city increases infrastructure rentals.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains the lowest compared to all the Czech Republic.
In the northern bums, where prices are already one of the highest, water and waste should increase by 7.4 per cent.
Strong rental price increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments where the so-called leasing regulation falls away from January.
For example, the CPI bytey apartment company, which has 2500 apartments in Ustí nad Labem, plans to increase rents with a hundred percent from January.
Whoever does not agree with this leasing increase will be interested in the company.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with Fernet and rum beer is out - it simply works too slow
Fernet, Rum and Wodka, exceptionally even a good whisky that was stolen from the housebar to the father.
These are the beverages of which drunk Czech teenagers have to be treated most frequently under fifteen.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep out of their cat in the hospital repeatedly.
This is seen from the experiences of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the inclusion of children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine is completely out of fashion, because it simply takes too long until you're drunk."
"The trend today is clearly harsh alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the head of the child department in the Middle Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds in removing a bottle from the housebar to the father, and if not, at least distance or wodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing him with juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief.
The speaker of the Faculty Disease House Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"The most common is farnet or room."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibovitz, which is taken from home," said Mrs. Jurinová.
According to Chef Pelikán, 13 or 14 years of drinking in the hospital are no exceptional appearance.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he has been working for ten years in the paediatric department of the Hospital Motol, where the rescue cars had dropped students from Nah and Fern.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began at 12 years when she was delivered in the blood for the first time with 3.5 promilles of alcohol and in combination with "Extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice at any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't seem strange that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," wonders the chief.
Especially the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance in attacking their own sprayers is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, a real dependence in the true sense of the word is not in the case of children.
"Alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependency on alcohol and all associated phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is characteristic," explains Chef Pelikán.
According to Mrs Jurinová, the spokesman of the Hospital Motol, about 40 drunk children were incorporated into the home department for children's and youth medicine until mid November.
However, only cases with heavy alcohol poisoning that required hospital stays enter the statistics.
Trunched children who are brought home by the parents or, where appropriate, by the police after ambulant treatment are not registered.
Besides the cases where children only drink such a bottle of snaps in the school bank, Mr Pelikán believes that there are three years of amplitudes, which are hundred percent leave: Walpurgisnacht, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The last mentioned for two reasons - either for sadness because of the bad testimony or for joy at the holidays."
"In the Walpurgis night I also experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better than a child who the next day only has to fight with an unpleasant cat.
The headaches in the following morning, which are dominated by the dehydration and the glucose deficiency, can be dispersed in the hospital with a liquid infusion with glucose and nutrients lacking the organism.
"They are clearly better on it, for after the "good" experience in the evening, they wake up with good sounds, without doing anything hurt anywhere."
"They're only a little confused about where they are," Dr. Pelikán admits, in which he sometimes degrades the good sound to patients by telling them the costs she'll cost the treatment.
Because the transportation with the rescue car and the night in an acute bed comes well and enjoys a few twenty thousand crowns.
"Hin and again, I used this as a educational tool, when I directly predicted the children during the visit, what cost their drinking and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays over to earn the money for one such feather," added Dr Pelikán.
However, he believes that the hospitals do not take action according to regression procedures to demand the costs required by the parents for healing the drunken children.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighting aircraft L-159 of a total of five who exchanged the Czech Defense Ministry against the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, fled to the Spanish city of Sevilla, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS sits.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
They have been seen in abroad only in manoeuvres or flight shows.
This is the flightable two-sitting version L-159T1, operated by the Czech Army.
The other three planes are L-159.
These are still conserved in Aero Vodochody, the intermediate of this business - the company Omnipol - took it last week.
When she expeds the planes physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, according to the Defense Minister, is not yet known.
In turn, the once-in fighting aircraft L-159 were excluded from long-term airplanes and this without further deposits and investments from the Ministry's Ressort.
"The double-sitting L-159T1 were exchanged in current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to come out without two-sitting fighting aircraft, as the Defence Ministry signed a 200-million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the conversion of four overflowing L-159 to a two-sitting version.
A new plane has taken over the army in July, the second will take it until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS is obliged to implement the fighting aircraft in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The Treaty clearly states that the company EADS is the operator of the aircraft L-159 and that it is intended to serve for the training of pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore the customer's matter in which way he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange trade of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further planes for 3.5 billion crowns was still approved by Mirek Topolánek's government last year.
At that time, the Ministry of Defense had not written a tendering procedure for the purchase, but spoke directly to EADS.
The Defense Office then argued that this change would support future exports of L-159 to abroad.
The Czech Army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only used 24 and the rest wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the aircraft Casa may still have a legal reputation.
The European Commission accused the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three planes Casa, the last is to land on the Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer point finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose point finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosteron.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, namely in men up to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Mrs Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she persecuted more than 1 500 patients with prostate cancer with her colleagues in Britain, while 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study, the right finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same prostate cancer prostate was likely, as for 19 percent of the men whose ring fingers and sign fingers were the same.
However, in men whose point finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to 60 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which are already in the prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of gender hormones exposed to the child in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer point finger.
Earlier research showed that testosteron is just increasing the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former Chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said that ČTK was known to him as a refugee, yet he did not think that the relationship between the length of the finger and the risk of cancer has been "voluntary".
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like the most part of Europe, Czech Republic is also under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walkways are mostly invasive snow, the winter ministers were on the axis all night in many places.
The D5 motorway between 89 and 90 kilometers towards Rozvadov is blocked for some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the central automotive club (UAMK).
At miles 91, a truck crashed, at miles 93, two trucks collapsed, in this accident there are injured.
A few cars are also in the street grave.
There are also problems at miles 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks have also collapsed here.
The drivers should ride right behind Brno at 190 kilometres or drive through Brno and drive up at 182 kilometres at the village of Kyvalka.
It is a mile-long steam.
Also on the D11, an accident has happened, and this is the same when it travels to Prague.
In Prague itself, a multiple centimeter thick snow cover is located and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns form in Prosek City, including the road Štěrboholská is completely consumed.
The safest means of transport is, at least, the metro.
The roads drive with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peace Square.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Stab meets.
There are also problems at the railway and on the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven quick train connections due to snow slopes.
For example, there are problems on the route of Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beround.
Travellers should be informed about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m. in the morning.
Most streets in southern marrows are only with increased caution.
At Vyškov, three adjacent roads are completely unmovable, in the vicinity of Brno there are still snowweeds and in the surroundings of Blansko you are forced to use snowfruits on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here you will also have to use snow-snee freaks.
When they get ridable again, it cannot be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is given in the area of white carpates.
On the roads that are allowed for natural protection only to be sprayed with internal sprays, a thick snow cover is up to five centimeters, ČTK suggested.
In Czech Republic, the new snow fell from two to ten centimeters, most in northern bums - up to 18 centimeters.
In the Mauritanian-Slesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it stops slicing slowly.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops used a new "intelligent" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, which is known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon influences the conflict with the Taliban there and moves the force ratio to their favors.
The new gun is like a super-good gun.
Their projectiles are led by laser with a meeting security of just a few metres into the target.
The special shots of caliber 25 mm, designed for this gun and containing high-explosive explosive explosives, work practically like small granates.
The shoots can be programmed so that they can explode on any point of their ballistic route not only when they fall to the target.
That means you can use it against an enemy who hides behind a obstacle - a wall or in a protective grave.
Because from above it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splitter rain from above can easily put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new weapon is the first infantry weapon that makes "intelligent" technologies useful.
"The soldier is in general doing so: he adapts the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins a precise point of vision after which he corrects the increase angle, then he only needs to print.
"Let's say, you've measured 543 m."
"If you press, the gun is invited and shoots the gun to the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are transferred
Fujitsu Group transfers its establishment in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will transfer their work from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu transfers its establishment in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 women and men will be assigned their work from the previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on the Lyoner Street in the Frankfurter Stadtteil Niederrad.
A spokesman of Fujitsu explained that there should be 100 more jobs in the group in the medium term, which have been distributed to the region.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the large space offices in the Astro Park were better countering the work of the employees.
Fujitsu had also been a tenant in Bad Homburg.
The responsible manager Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Nederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment of the losers yesterday.
The Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezernt Markus Frank (CDU) said that again a "Global Player" was won.
This is a "great location confession".
Fujitsu passed to the city, the settlement was an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bath Homburg mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early by the management of the intention.
"We of course offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at the Marienbader place.
Finally, economic reasons would have given the outcome.
Now it's about preventing a long space in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building will be cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu at the city hall and the neighbouring "Small Vertical" were one of the most controversial construction projects in the city of Kurstadt ten years ago with the rest of the buildings on the Marienbader Platz.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the railway station and the City House, which, due to the massive construction of the previously used areas as a parking lot and the height of the buildings, was critical.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, the start of Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, who was still connected to Siemens, included the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were purchased by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group in 2006 together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and continued to be sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
Fujitsu's home in Tokyo calls himself the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides businesses with computer and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The foundation in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees count Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions enters into Frankfurt-Nederrad, the other subsidiaries are supposed to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
The Astro Park was hired 7000 square meters in the office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-formed base rice -, among other things, the Central Association of Electronic and Electronic Industries has its seat.
Amazon locked server - threats against axis
Wikileaks are increasingly in need.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the distinguishing platform from its servers.
Possibly there is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange claims to stay in England.
The Wikileaks distraction platform is increasingly shaking in the United States.
The Internet operators lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American senator Joe Lieberman invited other countries and companies to the Boykott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol discovery list, is supposed to stay after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks of Amazon servers are forced."
"Free speech in the country of the Freedom", the defense-activists communicated Twitter by short news service on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet-Activists had reapplied the Amazon Web Service (AWS) during the publication of the secret diplomatic covers in order to manage the high numbers of access to the documents.
Per Twitter continued Wikileaks to the step: "Prima - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon had such a problem with freedom of speech, "they were supposed to stop selling books".
Amazon stopped the use of his server by Wikiileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman's research, the television broadcaster CNN reported at the office of Lieberman.
The president of the Senate Committee on Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a Boykott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would have wished that Amazon would take this action earlier in view of the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman called on the platform to reject the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unhealthy and unrespectful approach is at stake in our national security and threatens around the globe of life," said a communication from the partyless senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks-Grunder Assange, who is searched for rape suspicions by the authorities in Sweden, is on the list of findings by Interpol.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in Britain is holding up, the exact place is known as Scotland Yard.
The Internet-Activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as the entrance of his opponents.
Wikileaks speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls after Julian Assange's murder."
That is why Assange fears his security, said Mrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Mrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had called on the person responsible for the Wikileaks discharges to be accused and executed for treasure.
In Canada, a consultant of Head of State Stephen Harper said - apparently ironically - on television, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
The White House and Assange, therefore, burned out a stroke exchange.
The speaker of the American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "suite and absurd" that Assange had requested the withdrawal of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently announced spying calls for diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The American government now puts the protection of its databases comprehensively on the test level.
As a special representative, the Vice-Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Actions, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House informed.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" which had become necessary after the release of the news reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to see how the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American government also announced that they would want to ensure the security of dissidents and the most active ones, they should be at risk through the Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything to contact them," said outside official speaker Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that should be necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice scandors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest chance and visitors from all over the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
From Gelataio and from Gelataio.
The Geatier, in German a little older than the Iskonditor, produces the cream in accordance with all the rules of Italian Eismacherkunst.
The Gelataio picks up the ice cream from the refrigerator, strikes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice, he won't pass the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University has established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest coincidence and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several days special courses around chocolate ice and practices in the housey ice parts.
Some dream in the Midlife crisis of a new career, others simply dare at the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial Ice Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and after years in a nervous job wants to spend something own.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a piece of ice in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in her bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste is decisive but also silent flavor and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget in his training the sanitation of national and even Southern overbuilding: "Italian Gelato is just the best - and then there is a lot of romantics."
The first step in manufacturing seems very simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, salmon, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixing device that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools up to four degrees immediately.
Then he turns a hook on the machine and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, foundation for all milk ice.
Instantly, the teacher is stumbled with questions: Can you only produce ice cream with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you leave your own experimental desire free?
Luciano warns about being misled from the spirit of time.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only of natural ingredients" may have still used stabilisers - mostly a natural product, such as guarantor meal from the guarbone.
Of course, you can also produce ice without a stabilizer, only it must be sold within one day, otherwise it sucks in itself, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
More exciting with the flavours.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes for the taste in ice between the ingredients purchased in the fruit department or in the sweetnesses of the supermarket.
There are also powder and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn you on dozens of aromatized additives."
"But you should just experiment."
either in the fruit sorbits with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just at the ice cream from the white ground mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder for all possible chocolate transfers.
Now the course participants are allowed to get the ice machines.
Luciano allows it to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnus ice with or without eggs in the ground mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subjected to the fertilizers.
More flavors, more fruit pear - it's not necessarily better.
Haselnus-Ice doesn't really taste nuts if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice produces the working group that uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the taste of a gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Eish production is a calculation task: If Pfirsich pear with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
For lemon ice, an extra proportion of sugar is required.
Luciano draws a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit species (Winzer thus measures the ox in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate the machinery.
Making ice no longer takes as much physical use as before.
Not only the device for automatic production of the ground mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is at the same time brilliant and cooled at minus temperatures.
In spite of all automation, small pans do not stay out.
The Brasilian Gustavo climbs himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fertilizers when the overdimensional stab mixer does not control him.
"In every course," Maestro Luciano says, "it's just a matter of time until something like that happens."
Inspectors in twist light
The European Food Authority Efsa has been undermined by the genetic industry.
This presumption now forms the expert group Testbiotech, which is the independent institution for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Dan on Wednesday in Munich.
The leader of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract for years.
It is paid by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to the Efsa testing regulations for genetic plants and is therefore in a clear conflict of interests, then criticized.
The Efsa regulations are decisive, however, with Ilsi's position papers and thus devote the manuscript of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech is having an interest class.
This is how a high-level Efsa manager has recently changed the pages without any obligation or transitional time to the Swiss Agricultural Group Syngenta.
The Middle German Radio (MDR) has also recently revealed personal links between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobby, which has made the Environmental Confederation, as well as the EU-Parlamentary.
However, the Efsa cannot detect any conflict of interest.
It is a opinion that we reject all serious data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high quality of professional quality.
Of the experts who work for Efsa, they do not demand that they have no contacts with industry.
But you have to open them up.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) to the United States.
This itself refers to a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including the risk assessment of biotechnology without lobby commission.
In this case, independent experts like Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently authorised without any animal feeding attempt and the reaction of genetic plants to environmental impacts is not tested.
"We want to know, for example, what genetically modified maize does on the farm," then says.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't find the risks, how should you find them?" then ask accusing.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
The scientist has been researching gentechnology since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
Industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this field as well as in the US.
There are therefore hardly researchers who are not cursed with concerts.
Critical studies would normally not be published for companies.
"Industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The track of the stones
Uli Gsell also worrys about some 400 pounds.
On Monday evening, he was formed Stuttgart Train Station, Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
Cut it.
The story is known: in September the baggers had been pulled up and had started to break a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgarter World was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the billions of depth of the railway station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wings was in drums.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft grove stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in East Fildern, 43 years old.
He's got some of the pieces safe.
"These stones are reliquies."
"You can't go away."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he sucked one, he smoked to cigarettes.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the pieces yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The track of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest at Tübingen to a former municipality depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his rock line.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those who attacked at the abriss in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would be painted in Scotland or disappeared in the depony," he says in his office, a wooden farmer who once was a guardian.
He was insulted and threatened when in September he was in the newspapers that he bought the remains of the northern wing from the break-up operator.
But he talked to the S-21 owners for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything for the abrass.
And if it happens, then it would be the most reasonable if the stones were used.
Approximately 200 S-21 dealers took one of the 80 kilos heavy quadders in the cut, piece price 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but some also in the hope of returning him when rebuilding.
500 tons had bought rongs, 25 large truck loads.
About half is still stored in the forest, the rest is long sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, housebuilders.
From everywhere they had come and dragged away what could wear cabinets and trailers.
The Stuttgart stones of the offense have long turned into "mayerle" or to limitations of herb beetles.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Don't be the political component."
He rises in his archipelago, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great empire.
Jura has studied and cancelled, later biology, then he has been interested in computers and has finally become a stone dealer.
And stone lover.
40,000 tons of stones stored.
He carries his treasures together from all over Germany.
He says he's the largest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's bremsed.
In the snow, artificial sand stones are located.
"They once belonged to the Dresdner Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he's swarmed.
"My favorite stone."
It's going the way up through the forest.
He shows a bunch of red sandstein, formerly part of the Karlsruher Train Station.
And continue.
"Great Travertin."
The Quader belonged to the Tribunal of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstater Traverter from the Stuttgart police presidium, red granite from the Dom Sankt Blasien, tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were crocheted by hand and moved with simple bottles and ox cars, he becomes totally honorable.
"It would be a shame if you were to screw something like that."
He hasn't become rich, not at all.
But 14 people are working the stone dealer today, also have left themselves in the top of the forest stone metze, a sculptor, a smied, a glass blower and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the remainder.
Tomorrow, he'll have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
High-Pottials Competition
There's a real andrange on the buffet.
16 Students are pressing for salmon, tomatoes and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideological competition, they are to meet with VW developers about the car of the future - and alongside people's cars.
In the struggle around the smartest heads, many companies are now going into the near fight and, like VW, put on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: The most talented graduates are to recruit at the hearing halls as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are relocated by others.
And because the universities do not give out statements about the performance of their students, the exceptional figures are attempted to sped up and bind to themselves in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group is running around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ball writers, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful youth-talents of practitioners and student jobs and shows them ways in the concerts.
Nico Selle of the TU Braunschweig supports the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students come in contact with the industry and gather experience."
"VW can learn students at the same time, look at interesting candidates and think about who would be in question as employees."
Such cooperations, such as cell, are not unusual.
New is that the students are so offensively boasted.
"First, the focus was rather on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably become even harder.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to choose their employees from a large number of candidates.
In particular, they have to prize themselves and pay particular attention to highly qualified workers.
Especially graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Deutsche Ingenieur VDI, over 40,000 engineering offices remained unsettled in October.
And the so-called engineering gaps will be even greater according to VDI forecasts.
For the KPMG business auditing and consulting company, Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunting.
He organizes exciting recruiting events such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern snail hunting where the participants need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want the company to pass through the United States next year.
In addition, participants can look at KPMG-files and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to join decide in two selection rounds in the front.
Only the Crème de la Crème of the many candidates fly to the United States.
At the hooking and sticking around the High Potentials at the universities, the protectors, according to Dykta, become increasingly larger.
"We want to get rid of the race from the mass."
"Only a simple sailing door was too little for us."
For talent hunters, Dykta seems to be invoked.
"We have contact with all participants of a similar action last year until today."
"Some people are in front of their conclusion and want to apply soon to us," he says.
Besides direct bolting at the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are also gradually on the pirsch at professional measurements.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Etwa on the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, staff leader of the Solar Technology Manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company employs about 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the afterlife problem.
At present, 35 jobs are written on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy regular positions."
"It costs much time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the universal professionals.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that you can do practices with us or write your diploma work."
Expensive advertising actions are not included in the solar specialist.
For this, the company is trying to advertise with other advantages for itself: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
"This can't offer a large group often," says staff manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job searching.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good rise opportunities are other key factors.
Solarworld proved the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany at a study of the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employers.
For this purpose, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and are looking at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff manager Stübe hopes of the placement also plus points for the job seekers.
"I think applicants are especially looking for external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler by the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to increase authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as employer leads over your own employees," he says.
In the industry yargon, the internal employer Branding, i.e. employer brand education within its own staff.
"Satisfactory employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, then they would be admitted to friends and acquaintances alone for their employers.
"This is like a game with a band," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drills
Apart from the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drills in the coming years.
A similar ban has been adopted by the government in Washington and thus finally revoking its previous plans.
New drills are also forbidden before the Atlantic Coast.
This was notified by Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The explosion of the drill platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April is triggers for the strict ban to apply for at least the next five years.
Before the unhappy that eleven workers cost life and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled his willingness to allow new drills in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico on pressure from opposition and industry.
The supporters want to reduce the US's dependence on aliens from abroad.
Whoever is responsible for the devastating oil fever in the Gulf is not finally clarified until today.
In the centre of criticism, the British Energy Group is BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
A Obama's investigation commission is intended to present its results in the course of December.
In October, Minister Ken Salazar had lifted the drill stop tied after the explosion.
Afterwards, various oil companies had made applications for new drilling projects.
With sharper controls and stricter safety rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.
Currently, the competent control authority, which has been in charge of many corruption proposals, is fundamentally reformed.
Together, Obama announced to close luxurious tax leaks for oil and gas companies.
The industry now warns publicly that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower by stricter regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the largest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry", the result of a current industry survey by the BDO consultant - before the wound drill ban.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "None knows what will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be pushed up to further - the burden of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the tank site: billions of litres of raw oils have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari's good.
"Don't take off," the ecoactivist reassures the journalists: "You're going to get enough oil slam from the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to dispose of a boy who is walking up to the breast in the water with the slides surrounded by it: in the rainbow colored water gloss, the scene is almost nice.
That brown raw oil swim under the surface is not to be seen.
Earlier she gathered garnels here, Esther Badom tells on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty-Fluss.
In the meantime, the flowing waters were completely dead.
Five years ago, a brushed pipeline flooded out Uncommons of raw oil into the huge moisture area.
Fishermen from the nearby town Bodo now have to rest six hours to get into fishing waters: the Ogoniland located in the heart of the Nigerdelta is considered to be one of the worst contaminated regions in the world.
On the drive through the mangrove pumps through the rivers, the entire extent of the devastation becomes visible.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat would pick up brown brown brown browns, who pops his hand into the water, pulling out odd fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees rage like black lacryts from the soil, sadly make palms hang their wombs singlely.
Bird swarms, as they are normal in moisture areas, are chosen in vain: as soon as the outer board swims, there is a spacious peace in the former paradise that smells like a tank.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," Celestine Akpobari window says, "We live in constant danger of health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni's settlement area is a battlefield that has been struggled for decades ago: here, more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe, organised here in the 1980s with the later exclaimed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is rejected to return to Ogoniland: While the whole Delta region pumped from the threefold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drill sources and 7000 kilometres of pipelines every day over two million faces of black gold, the oil fields in Ogoniland are too instability to the group.
All the few hundred metres of stealing sites like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian trees" are called the heads of the drill holes too warmly.
They are up to 50 years old, most to the brand corrodated.
Once again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant flow of raw oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres have been fled into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year by year the amount of oil, as they were in the Havaria of the Exxon Valdez Supertanker 21 years ago in the sea before Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the persistent eco-GAU is contested about it.
During the shell group sabotage and organised oil diets are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectors see brown heads and delicious pipelines as main causes.
Shell sets much lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner suggested to the Group in 2008: only the rate of defects in the directions is "a lot higher than elsewhere".
In a place that from the distance looks like a abandoned, oil-smalled workshop under free sky, appears from the mangrove designs: they are divided and swallowed up to the neck of oil.
Among one of the many vessels, which are partly connected to tubes, tend to be randomly distributed on the ground, a fire flakes: an illegal small refinery.
In the Fass, the raw oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline is pushing through the pipes into the capture top, later trapped at the end of the direction of cerazine and finally diesel.
Thus, Michael and four employees produce up to four legs diesel à 300 liters daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The Delta inhabitants use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one raffinery.
The ridiculously low diesel price of just 40 euro cent per litre can still undertake the illegal cookers: because their raw material gets for nothing.
It comes from "bunkerers", which pump the pipeline network across Ogoniland: In this way, the country, according to experts throughout the Nigerdelta, loses at least 16 million litres of raw oil daily.
However, only a small part of the temporarily intermediate raw material is illegally degraded: the proportion of lions fills organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-level military, in tankships and crushes it in the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is more due to the transformation of the population or to the lax production mode, considers the activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not seen as infringements and wouldn't have destroyed the fishermen's life base so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage or steel and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the relationship of Ogoni, especially with Shell, is so devastated that only a deduction of the group would be questioned: "Perhaps other nationalities, such as the Chinese, might be better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"Make time for you to disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil distributors are caught by the special unit of forces, they are not threatened to arrest, but a painful lubrication.
The soldiers, mainly from the country order, like all Nigerians, also want to benefit from the raw material.
"This fucking thing brought our country to the dog in every respect," says Akpobari.
Explorer discovers dangerous construction errors in A380 engineering
The A380 seems to have a great security problem.
Measurements have discovered a possible construction error in the investigation of a note-landed machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas airline is now seeking to accuse the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the landed Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November seemed to have been much more lucky than before: the Australian Air Safety Authority has detected a major security problem in its investigations with the drivers of some A380 machines - and now warns about possible construction errors.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil slaughter connection, it could produce fatigue and leaks, said an opinion published by the ATSB authority on Thursday.
This could have resulted in "a catastrophic engine failure".
Driving plants produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series planes.
Among these is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now launched legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
She submitted a complaint at an Australian Federal Court in Sydney which allows him to take further legal measures against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said that his airline would require compensation for the incident in early November.
At the fire of the engine, parts had been dissolved and the surfaces had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 drivers must now be exchanged worldwide.
The Australian mediators announced that further safety tests should be carried out on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation was the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem has been considered sufficiently important to inform all the concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of his eleven A380 temporarily on the ground.
At an A380, the Lufthansa altered the engine as a precautionary measure.
The double-piece flyer is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Land-wide snowfall causes traffic chaos
Germany whole in White: Overnight snow fell almost throughout the country.
On many streets chaos, trains and flights fall out.
In car accidents at least three people died.
The winter froasts Germany: At iron temperatures, nearly all the Republic is cut on Thursday in the night - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there are some 15 centimeters of thick snow covers.
On several motorways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was in constant effort, but it was not finished with the constantly new snow.
In addition, heavily soils fed over the Baltic Coast.
The Bundesamt für Seeschifffahrt und Hydrographie (BSH) is expected at the eastern coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning at storms with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, the snow sways on the motorways and Bundesstraßes led to significant problems.
According to the Meteomedia of the Unwetter Center, in Sachsian Switzerland, the alarm level of violet was due to the highest level at all.
Partly there, 30 centimeters of new snow fell, fresh and strong winds provided for bleeding.
There were several trucks and cars in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to steaming traffic and steam.
A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall in Thuringia.
According to Deutscher Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thüringen and northern Bayern.
Snow on the slides, crashed trees on the rails or destroyed upper lines and softs are the main problems.
In Sachsen, the distance traffic from Leipzig had to be stopped to Nuremberg.
In the German hall field, a ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemen and rescuers with clouddocks, food and drinks in the train.
Snow winds fought over the streets.
On large German airports, snow winds lead to numerous flight crashes.
In Munich, some cancellations have already been reported, according to one speaker of the flight information centre.
According to one fraport speaker, 40 flights have already been deleted in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service is in permanent effort.
Although only a few passengers are struck at the airport, there are still nearly 400 field beds for them.
On many streets there were accidents on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died at the collapse with a train on a railroad in Eastholstein.
The locker was easily injured.
In the vicinity of Nürnberg, a similar accident was caused due to snow-covered roads: a truck was also recorded on a railroad because the vehicle remained steady.
The driver died.
In the train four passengers were injured - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore locked up to the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after overlooking her car at Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
But the meteorologists have a good message: although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore already scattered at light soils.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is struck by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twinstorms
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its true sign: According to a newspaper report, the money house seeks buyer for the two office towers at its Frankfurter Hauptsitz.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property.
The German Bank has just made its concert seat nice: the twinstorms in the Frankfurter Bankenviertel have been modernised; in the meantime the bankers were allowed to return to their old work.
But now the financial group seems to want to recover the costs of renewal - and seeking a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" calls for a speaker.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it is more meaningful to own or sell property itself and then return," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution will thus return to its company seat in a short time.
The Bank had only taken the double towers for EUR 272 million from the investors of a domestic fund in mid-2007 and then renovated it.
Energy reconstruction was depleted by around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Branchen experts estimate the value of the towers that have been renamed to "Greentowers" in the newspaper to some 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund in possession of the Bank or to an independent investor, are still open, said the speaker.
Thousands grieve for dead friend
More than 10,000 people have thought in New Zealand of the shaken mountains who were declared dead after several explosions in one mine.
Still, the bodies could not be secured because the security situation in the accident bag is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth, there was a huge explosion.
29 mining workers aged between 17 and 62 were shaken in days.
A sin had been left down in the calamity, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could fall for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no survival chance for the mates.
The bodies could not be secured until now.
Now family and friends remembered the dead with a memorial.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island at the radiating sunshine.
They're swearing for two minutes.
In honor of the shaken mountainmen, 29 tables were set up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the companions were to be seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfbretters, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags woke half-mast.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the Memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not finish with the death of his son as long as he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was shaken in the grube.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the members of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial.
During the first explosion on November 19, mines of British and South African origin were also shaken.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire inside the coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were forced, they were beginning to cool down the glittering temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Damn it, warrior!
Does splatter fit the art cino?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn re-lots with his fighter epos "Walhalla Rising" old Genre boundaries.
Which audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A captive Wikinger warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his pitchers and ranks his opponents with nearly superhuman forces - sounds ideal for young male audiences looking for bloody action, just because our hero likes to use rabiate killing methods and his enemies once gets the hearts out of the living body when he has bad sounds.
On the other hand, Einauge says, as he is actually called, the whole film about no word, and also the other figures can be ripped up to one or two sentences or a few painful death screams.
Otherwise, it is swept and swallowed in the terrible beautiful hill landscape of Scotland, which the Wikingerwelt of about a thousand years ago offers the scenes.
Ideal rather for adult cineasts with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera trips.
Nice, if a movie has several target groups, only harm if they exclude each other.
Regisseur Winding Refn has been considered to be a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but it is stupid to refuse to make his works available to the arthouse with a little more humor to the mainstream or slightly less brutality.
Most artificial kino friends are likely to be disappointed from the spraying brain mass and the infants.
The action fans die at least before boring when inauge, for freely interpretable reasons, breaks up with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via a ship to Jerusalem and puts an eternity in flat and noble before the team apparently arrives in America and continues to sweep there.
No wonder that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has not found a cinema rental and now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially due to the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloody facade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this film it's not about dialogues or a stringent action, it's all the atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And there's no escape from that for the spectator.
Refn hardly takes him a moment of relaxation and cuts him with his irony pictures and the dark trance-like sound track very slowly to the throat, but especially with the immense hatred that strikes him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blonde boy, who is faithfully on the side, keeps something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of the lonely hero, whose motives are never explained, but who becomes a warrior from hell at any time to enemies and temporary allies, perhaps as an ambassador of the Devil himself.
He means corruption, but perhaps only for those who are devastated.
"Walhalla Rising" is a ridiculous film that you can hate and admire, to angry, excitement and stupidness.
It's an experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new references to a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
But the country resists to take a position in this regard - yet it allows controls.
At midnight, 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighting aircraft attack a mysterious, spoil-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the next bigger city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria is supposed to have built from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a valley that goes away from the current.
According to a letter by the U.S. Secret Service CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also used under the name of the nearby village el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, the technology from the fifty is hardly due.
The CIA presented a video presentation with unclear satellite images.
By computer animation, she blew up where the reactor's components should have been before destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the nuclear center of Yongbyon.
In addition, she presented photos that show the building from nearby or even the inner space.
The reactor was standing shortly before the operation, it said, but had not yet been recorded with fuels.
Today, more than three years after the bombardement, is hardly known more than then, yes, the puzzles became more larger with time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly found that there was an active nuclear program in the country.
Some secret servants in Europe prefer to be more cautious and speak only of a "reactor" even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomat answered only lapidar in summer, which IAEA has "good material to ask questions".
Although the Syrians quickly created the shot of the so-called "unused military building" and planned the land thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team found Olli Heinonen former chief in el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from time to time directly after the attack that might be more significant than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - bought it exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always proved to have never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, explained Damascus.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after the analysis of particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as did the satellite images.
It also refuses the controls a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the drums of the bombed building.
But also Israel is silent to iron.
"We will never comment," recently confirmed the official position of the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
As a result, the investigation of the case has been unresponsive since June 2008 and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the Authority", as a high Western diplomat at the site of the IAEA in Vienna acknowledges - finally a serious violation of the nuclear weapons locker contract in the area over which the IAEA is watching.
As a key to progress in the information, the IAEA appears to see three other facilities that are to be "in functional connection" with the suspected reactor and still exist.
The inspectors have not yet revealed what installations it is, what function they have or what they may seem suspicious.
According to the South German newspaper, they are called at the IAEA internally as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and made a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be in or right next to a military base - precisely with this reason, Syria of the IAEA refuses access to the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the United States to preserve military installations.
Because the nuclear detections had become focused on the facilities through a tip of the U.S. secret services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quadder of the Euphrates material has been transported.
A high western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the installations could be "related to fuel production".
However, there are "no references to sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or rebuilding; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium should later be separated for the bomb, there are absolutely plausible suspicions about these central issues.
It is also unclear whether drummers that could mountain valuable traces were stored at the three places.
As if the hundreds of truck loads had disappeared from the ground, nobody wants to have information about where the shoot stayed.
The salt mine al-Tibni located on the other side of the Euphrates, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar, which in 1998 studied Syria as a stock for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently contacted her in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review with the reactor.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria did work on the three suspected places of earth and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be coincidence, but it has hardly contributed to eliminating suspicion.
In addition, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - only showing the effort of the inspectors' interest.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
If western diplomats in Vienna have still emphasized a year ago that the reactor was indeed destroyed, so the matter has no high urgency, such as U.S. messenger Glyn Davies has been playing for a few months so-called special inspections, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna Atomic Authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who had to suggest these inspections, has already spoken of "a option for which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitating.
There is a high risk in this way: firstly, there is a majority in the Governing Council of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are everything other than a escalation.
Secondly, how a diplomat can be considered: "What if they don't find anything at the end?"
Love in the Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her unnamed government debut in summer, there are troubles.
The screening book wrote herself, a story of love between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's already enough for unrest.
The rumour, the woman, a Muslimin, remains in love during the Yugoslavia war in her Serbian rape.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some of Sarajevo's planned turning days were moved to Hungary short-term.
In the meantime, the film has been rotated in Hungary and in postal production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of women's war sacrifices wrote about the UN refugee aid work to Jolie and requested a meeting with the actor, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is even ambassador of the UN refugee help.
She is not diplomatic - she has offered women a meeting in Hungary a few weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting had to take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolies' attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the screening book.
According to the UN refugee aid work, your organization has recommended that Jolie be released as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received her diary, has, after some time, granted a rotation permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not yet come.
The young author himself admits, they do not pursue any political intentions with her film, have worked with much effort into the Yugoslavia conflict, want to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all sides involved.
However, it remains vague at the content.
Thus another second synopsis to the film in the network, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew about it before the war outbreak and met again when they, a Bosnian Muslim, are transferred to a Serbian camp in which he works as a guard.
What sounds quite different from the variant "Atrocity sacrifices fall into torture slave".
That Jolies film actually begins before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on them, Jolie says, is "unfair and based on error information".
Now you may only be able to provide the hackers of Hollywood peace: by putting the screening book illegally in the network, like so many before.
Nothing like away from here.
This evening, it's finally going around again for the Irish.
No trace of distress.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans shout for joy at cracking loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey pub shakes in the Southern Cork because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-metre distance in beer cups - and meet them.
"Bierpong" calls for the bizarre spectacle, there is 500 Euro win premium plus air tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this screaming drinking game and the restraining computer, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
On his plan, there is no gambling gambling in Las Vegas, he will lead the application talk in New Zealand in January.
"I have a mummy feeling," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I don't have work there."
After all, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "she had no time to see her wish work as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and laughs.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of Tanner's three brothers have already sought their luck in abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has an office as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will probably leave the country next time, says experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a huge loss.
The forecasts are similar to those under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of the swelling that brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse is now again spreading.
In particular, the economic crisis insecures the young, well-educated irons, for which it has only gone up.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the trees.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under thirty are without work.
In the Irish Times, there are a number of readers of young immigrants who complain: "All things are going down the bach in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country will lose a whole generation."
"The last one, please turn out the light."
Jura student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future, because the government is only engaged in eyewashing and the young people no longer offer future prospects.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how their comilitons turn from an unpaid practice to the next hang.
Her greatest concern, she says, is it to have to emigrate in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressive."
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to take the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair offering a round service to work in abroad.
"For professional beginners, the work in abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career elite," says the manager.
On his website, photos of surfers in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada are shown.
The message is clear: working in abroad is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they just pull up a fashion house.
In January, it goes on to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home sees O'Donovan only rarely now because he makes extra layers to pay off the credit for his house at home.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, when after a long time, he goes over the threshold of his house for the first time.
"I deserve money in Germany for a house in Ireland in which I am almost never again."
He laughs something and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with nursed gardens, in the entrance parking large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros four years ago - 100 percent credit financed.
"There were crazy times, there were simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could be wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan considers for a while, pours up hot tea and says: "I have no children I have to feed through and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from new ones."
The construction engineer doesn't like the complaining that he is often hearing.
"Nobody needs to hungry - our situation is far not as dramatic as in the past here on the island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it's not the only way we feel like Irene."
He laughs and then tells about his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Let the future open and just look at how it is going with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London he's already behind himself, and why wouldn't it run well for him and his friend in New Zealand?
One thing, however, is still there that disturbs him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it could get into a life well-being party.
"Don't be too many emotions," he says and drinks a large swallow of his beer.
"Well, that sounds scary."
"Let's rather call it a road party, very loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobarometro survey carried out in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly in mind in this year's survey of September and October.
First of all the good mood in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democratic prosecutors increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong breakdown last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Diagram 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents explained that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust the convention of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% or 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crisiss undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This also continued during the global economic crisis may be the fact that Latin America's countries experienced only a short recession phase and recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(Reports of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America of this week in 2009 have just increased the poverty rate in Latin America slightly and have fallen by 32% again this year.)
But from land to country there are strong differences in voice (see Diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the divorcing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflects a widespread progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and has increased violence, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the beginning of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see a bigger problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Diagram 5).
Approximately 31% claim that either they or a family member have been victims of a crime last year, but 38% last year have decreased and thus reached the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: approximately 71% of the respondents overregionally indicated that the private economy is essential for development, in 2007 there was 56% (see Diagram 6).
Approximately 58% explained that only market economy can make progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, states many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, the interviewers in Mexico and most countries of Central America see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A electoral league
No one had expected the elections would be perfect in Haiti on 28 November.
But the facts exceeded far the fears of the electoral helpers who were eager to help the country.
Overfilled electoral horns, multiple votes, electoral cards in Rinnstein, destroyed electoral spaces and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Election room opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, struck around looking for a choice.
Some finally gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspicious leaders, demanded the withdrawal of the election results due to a alleged fraud.
There were partially violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission in Haiti, referred to the election "as quite good in many interests".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community ", these irregularities, as seriously as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is claimed to be obliged to the unwanted divorce president René Préval and its candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected choosing is available for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial infringement complaint.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no consent with the voters, explains from the voter to the winner of the election, this could cause problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earth’s victims still live in tents, a small participation in the election was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by lack of organisation from voting.
Shortly before the beginning of the election, about 250,000 certificates needed for the election were not distributed.
There's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in rebuilding Haitis.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
During the weeks after your husband's sudden death, Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave of sympathy that drives her popularity rate by 20 points up to more than 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether it helps you to re-election next year, depends on whether the deliberate cristina Fernández is more compromising than her dead husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also directed the economic policy after his wife's election, often set up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President-in-Office to issue the extra revenues in accordance with its own terms.
On the paper the Fernández government lost the majority in the Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further infringements.
Some regime critics from the series of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (which a parliamentary encountered another, and others accused of the government of the decoration), the Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also applicable for the next year, which will give the President even more opportunity to spend money on his own goodwill.
The economy is running hot: it will probably grow by 9% this year.
The official inflation rate, for example, is 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of trade unions - are at nearly 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the Office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crisiss, explained growth and poverty to its main goals, not the inflation reduction.
He refused cooperation with the IMF, insisted on the private sector, and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Country INDEC, which then enriched the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a moderate path now?
It has called on the private economy and the trade union leaders to talk.
According to official statements, wage increases should be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
However, inflation undermined growth by a large devaluation in 2002.
Cristina Fernández may, for this reason, want to join the rest of the world financially.
At the beginning of this year, the government concluded an agreement with securities owners who had rejected the former reschuld of the country in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to have a deal with the money donors from the Paris Club that they owe about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a verification by the IMF, as otherwise used.
However, in the last month, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund will provide "technical assistance" in the creation of a new national consumer price index. It seems that this is the first step to clean the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after its term of office, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, which is mostly enough from the churcherism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of the symptom that has been brought to her will be evacuated.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether she silences and silences many political decisions of her husband.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters slowly approach a closer connection to the mainland.
What do Taiwan think of his big brother beyond the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all voters, made up to choose in the five districts of the city mayor and councils. This is considered as a broad assessment of the President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building break-up business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol for relations with the continent. His policy has for the first time changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland since 1949.
Ma's been testing, but just hardly.
Although his Kuomintang-Partei (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports Taiwan's greater independence, received nearly 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In the case of a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's votes have fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the KMT in the city councils.
During the election, there were common events in Taiwan such as truck convois with crawling makers, flag-switching mass turns and only dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the Chief Chan of the KMT, spoke to a KMT candidate on the evening before the election,
When a man shot in his face from the multitude. Lien was wound and killed a surrounded spectator.
Bizarrist is not clear whether the protector wanted to kill Lien or to bring up a conflict with the candidate.
Independently, the attack according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has impaired the choice and brought the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has provided more voices.
China may have been the largest winner of the campaign.
It is noteworthy that relations with the mainland were not being thematized.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their real independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, KMT does not like to focus on its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also avoided to cut the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new consciousness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
On the other hand, Ma wishes to be confirmed that the majority of the Taiwanese people support China's policy.
The Government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to relocate Taiwan with economic incentives into the Community.
China immediately sent a distributor to Taipeh to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration, but the most important first.
It prefers to wait until the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has now refocused.
She was strongly weakened two years ago: the former leader Chen Shui-bian sat in prison because of corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he accepted absolute independence.
However, under Tai's reign, a new generation of gradual politicians developed, and the DPP fights for the voices of professionals and youth.
Tsai, as a presidential candidate of the DPP, received great consent, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything to show that it is also able to build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea smed as a contact point between the DPP and China, but this requires non-profit discussions.
Tsai publicly explained that her party offered a "confidential alternative" to Mas faster approach to China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to stand on Taiwan’s independence.
He even invited Pragmatic Su to refrain from the presidential candidate.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is difficult to choose its possible candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; KMT candidates wanted to lead their election fight without it.
The main reasons for his inappropriateness seem to be unemployment and the increasing gap between poor and empire.
According to a KMT speaker, he will transform his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is limited to reconciliation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese view economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no return anymore".
Grammy nominations: The Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly excellent in the Newcomer category of the year
If you appear on request of a President, the people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to take place at the ceremony at the Nobel Prize rental in 2009. Now the 26-year-old Jazz Bassin and Sängerin were surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star since its album "Esperanza" in 2008 in the Jazz scene, the nomination appears a little unusual, but it corresponds to the Grammy rules, which a artist may have released no more than three albums before he was published in the general public.
Your ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its conspired voice and a good feeling for Pop, Funk and Latin Music, you can easily compare Spalding with Norah Jones in 2003, whose great success as a Jazz interpret in this category of nomination Spaldings comes next.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category of instrumental albums. This was a giant result of this favorite of critics.
One of Iyers' competitors includes "Moody 4B" of the experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the Contemporary Jazz category, where you can find albums from Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret Societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well deserved attention in the category Large Group. He thus acts against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurely Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads in classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53th Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five votes, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an organic orchestra work, with three votes.
Among the nominates with connections to South California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles" has been ordered by the Los Angeles Philharmonicists, and in 2009 in the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The LA composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classic producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckners Symphonies No. 3 and 4 by Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the Opera category, Bergs "Lulu by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wandererer" by the Orchestra and Chor of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales nominated.
As composers, pets for symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wandererer" for a Grammy nominated.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was recorded and recorded on 4 January in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The about 30-minute piece wears the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnet Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline concert" received nomination in the Instrumentalsolo category with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who conducted the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," explained Dorman in a telephone interview.
Dirigent Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category orchestra offer for recording the works of Strawinski with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental solarists, the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, Geiger Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
This year only women were nominated as vocal soldiers, including Anne Sofie by Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Precisx and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, the Sopranistin Jessye Norman was nominated for its recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Moskee in Temecula wins approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Criticals promoted the project both terrorism and transport.
However, according to the Commission's statement on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre meets the local provisions and will become an aesthetic viewpoint.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As Americans, this makes me proud."
"It shows that righteousness is ruled."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"You're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre took almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides, according to press-Enterprise, were quite equally distributed.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," said a comment.
"It's another planet of the monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on 11 September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violencelessness.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a larger and better place than the camp they rented together with a manufacturer for water filter facilities.
The new mosque in the Mediterranean style is about 2.300 m2 to have two minarettes and become about 13m high.
It is supposed to be created on the about 17,500 m2 large property on the Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbes could allow new forms of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacteria, which can live from arsen, opens new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements considered to be vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online release of the magazine Science, explained: "This makes it very special, although it is almost a kind of 'a strange' life form."
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake continues to grow even if it replaces arsenic phosphorus.
"Then you wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, so Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, caused too widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "hows that in other planetal systems organisms can be activated with other elements of biochemical processes and that the 'standard elements' that we believe are absolutely vital are not necessarily defined," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novum, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiological Institute, who conducted the study, chose the Mono Lake due to the high arsenal content.
Since arsen and phosphorus are chemically similar, they assumed that microbs that are both exposed may substitute one element with the other.
"The arsenic toxicity is primarily based on chemically similarity to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so large that arsen works differently than phosphorus. It comes into our biochemical system, where it almost embraces everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers put the bacterium GFAJ-1 out of an increasing arsenal concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can also survive in arsen, it shows that an arsenic life form can naturally occur, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsene occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, teacher for microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that Phosfor can be replaced by arsen is not new. But there has not been any functioning example yet.
Arsen occurred more frequently in the early earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to assume that life could also have developed differently than in the early age of the earth," says Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
Research was supported by the NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authority.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition dogs stolen before a bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff of Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, as unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express Van where the animals were placed before a Bellflower Motel 6 nights, the authorities stated.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well-being," said Whitmore.
"You're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legal owners."
Whitmore did not make detailed information about the place of the dogs yet to the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say more," explains Whitmore.
"We're following some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They took their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon in a district home in Downey.
Sheriff's representatives found the delivery car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a three-year-old ride, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were injured according to authorities' statements.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek wanted to present this week in order for their Japanese owners to compete, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city on this weekend because of the ACC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek the Times announced on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days before the ACC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the pair of dog views to dog view.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their cars in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer whale, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with in their motel room.
The dickful Akitas and Corgis stayed in the delivery car because it was cooler there.
They let the window open a bunch wide, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car to be stolen on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised a finder wage to anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, there was no idea if a finder pay was paid.
The lion reappears after the legal approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18-month turbulences and uncertainties, MGM finally received green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New Yorker Conkurs Richter officially blessed the "prepared" creditor plan to raise the debts of $5 billion and the 86-year-old entertainment company for new films and television shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of the US banking law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, will be in no way. Barber and Birnbaum will be present to the awkward studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually enters into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the Investment Bank, which itself imports $75 million, starts the company. Financing is supposed to be in mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the management of the company, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year, to help solve their financial problems.
In August, the manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and structuring experts known by his activity at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the financial concerns of MGMs and pay out more than 140 creditors of the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company for sale at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few tenderers and nobody wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring of this year everything began from the beginning of the MGM team with the restructuring plan, which, after months of debates and internal disputes, was finally signed by the believers at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co, which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid for the company's management monthly $375,000, receives a $4 million result bonus.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio brought out only one film and created a year plan with seven or eight films to come to the cinema early 2012.
They plan two films after "The Small Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate liability between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films that are to be created under the regime of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to fusion the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can get a significant hole into your gift budget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jump arrows or about 48 doses of play doh.
But you can clean your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year the technology toys are more efficient and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, is a broader offer.
There are increasingly more button cell-driven toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-yigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are pleasant figures, as large as seaswitchs that sing a note when pressing on their abdomen.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, you can play a song by multiple pressures.
Several Sing-a-ma-yigs sing in harmony.
Warning: If you have started pressing once, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of sending and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Prize $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo live technology developed last year, the animatronic pop offers interchange games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the new shaving foot with bicycle blockation, it dominate the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, your parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back there (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole lot of question cards with which a car ride can become to a lesson hour, with a better certified with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, there are three independent alternatives here.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games contained on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, lighter screen after Leaprogs first large revision of the leapster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for the games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Lastly, there is scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a string wooden box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together in words before the time is over. It is great for an improvised letter competitor.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important ones.
To give your child an online animal in the Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the Code Online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin Store for two more parts.
This can be rolling shoes or a puffle stupid animal.
The latest head cell-driven microroboter, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not greater than your tooth drill head.
The bug moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicon legs in any direction.
It's funny to send him through a miserable garden.
And he holds some things out.
Our man fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China become more gentle
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped through a urban place, checked his nervous submissions and gave commands with military authority and dipped voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary racials and their hang of violence - to impress the spectators.
"Stay right!"
"Look straight!"
"Tell them," he whispered them, "what beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, hardly grown out of the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and hooks stood stramm.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight row.
Four regular shelters sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white sleeves.
"For me they look averagely," says Mr. Tang minorly.
"Models are nice."
Several governments have already tried topolate the image of China's city inspectors.
In one city, all new candidates must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey green.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by low stars: In 2009, 50 officials surrounded a non-comprehensive imbis car and stared on the operator until he packed up after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have strengthened the urban police strips. They have been selected specially due to their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the violent police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad picture that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, that's the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials may apply urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province cried a spectator to death when he filmed her with his cell phone how they hit a protest against a garbage.
Last year, a training manual of the Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be scrapped without blood poisoning.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a hand volume of five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China when they attack street dealers.
"Chengguan scares the government," lamented the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy on tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics are the present approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district searched eight female recruits in October, a editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real tasks or only serve as optical distractions.
Probably both.
According to postal announcement, women aged 18 to 22 were searched with good figure and "harmonic facial trains".
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with reaching the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is too laborious.
"The most important thing is her image," said an unnamed district official at the quasi government website Rednet.com.
"When the candidates get the job, they first depend on their external appearance, such as size, weight, facial drawings, etc.."
Then temperament and "interior qualities" come.
"Women Chengguans are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond they have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, Vice-President of the City Administration of the District, does not wish to attend this description,
However, it admitted that in China, size requirements in position indicators for both gender are not unusual.
The same applies to even facial trains.
Whether this is equal to good appearance, it is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical dispositions do not need to apply.
"We are unfortunately unable to use lambs or buckles here," says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, patroled on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple bags and a well-formed mouth.
She did not feel sexist that her appearance is so greatly valued.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic view.
Her colleague with the groves, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their data, they do not regret the short attitude, since they have more ambitious career plans than simply shame dealers through the gases to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many bread and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on the bike before they are hunted.
"Here Wang, please get out of here."
"We have already told you this so often!" explained Miss Xu to a trader who had fled to foot and had temporarily left his nudel cake fixed on a bicycle car.
According to officials, the activity is more monotonous than effortful.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who is studying sales in leisure.
"All routine."
One reason is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of traders, such as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male supervisors.
This is intended to protect them from public enemy, which officials are often exposed to in China.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, after the rumour graduated, Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured at the night, 14 government vehicles were killed or burned.
Xindu has so far been rejected by such violence exhibits.
But unrests are not excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang site, where the female officials patroled this morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against the rules on the cemetery instead of in a workshop.
The owner cried Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of delay, the officials with angry face went to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, remained back. He turned his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained in presenting a clean image.
"Sometimes, we're going to be tricky."
"Sometimes but also physically," explains Mr. Li nüchtern.
"The most time people start with the fight."
State Attorney will not accuse Senator Ensign
State prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice have released Senator John Ensign from the accusations that, after his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to give her husband a lobby activity against him, the Senator's lawyers announced on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most difficult legal proclamation against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which provided headlines throughout the country and put his career a damper, he considered it as a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "goodly pleased" about the judgment after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate's Ethics Committee could impose another discipline penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign were suspended and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to express itself on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. You believe that there was sufficient evidence that Ensign had failed the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents opened for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, helped to luxurious orders to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as treasure champion during an election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to provide Hampton work. According to the documents and hearings, he took over for them after Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to take lobby work for a year for his former employer or the entire Senate.
According to Ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which was closely friendly before the Affaire, dismissed the so-called prohibition of the turn door lobby.
According to the published indices, "it appears to be a deal and a violation of the turn door states," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients who are in the vision of the government.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethican forests said that the Ministry seemed very cautious in taking up political charges after a variety of defeat persecuted by the media, including the decision last year, to drop the charge against the former Senator Ted Stevens for the failure of the state lawyer.
State lawyers "is obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington", a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign before court.
"This in principle means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Chief Defencer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a call from a state lawyer on Monday and another one on the next day, in which he was informed that the Ministry would not raise any complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defender had cooperated with the state lawyers to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a declaration on Wednesday, " acted in line with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not well going into the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Only so much is said: We believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to initiate investigations due to a separate complaint by the ethics group, after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensigns' parents to the Hamptons infringed the federal election law.
The election Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money had been something different than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found, thanks to Mr. Ensign Lobbyist's work.
An e-mail from December 2008 demonstrates that after Mr. Hampton had passed on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Staffchef, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was in the Ministry of Interior because of an "anklopfe".
Mr. Ensign was also attended to lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transport to reach a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had suspended for lobby work.
Last year, when the first time Mr. Ensign urged public information about this matter, he apologized his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had stood in the order of the Republicans in the fourth place.
After he had not noticed many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police research, his press speaker, Jennifer Cooper, said the Senator hoped that the ethics Commission would follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set up his investigations very quickly.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire call focuses on Twitter
A half dozen of them tipped into the crab walls in the courtroom.
They sent their reports about cruel witness statements on Twitter in the minutes' deck.
At the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully followed process by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end if the judge's speech falls on the death sentence that the jury has spoken.
But Mr Haye's lawyers have already submitted applications to the court, explain the reasons for appeal and which the courts will be addressed for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has resulted in a "cirkustopmosphere" and a so widely widespread, prompt breakdown of rebellious details, so that the jury had been inadequately influenced by public disarmament.
This controversy could cause the application courts to consider whether new technologies will be necessary in the courtroom.
"As I experienced during this process, I think it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects each individual's right to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye's main defender.
The Vice-President, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, gave the requests by decision briefly and thoroughly back last week when he said that the New Media would be "intimately controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But this was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court claims have found that the reporting on famous cases makes doubts arise in the fairness of a process.
In his historical decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States rejected the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Easteopath of Cleveland, who had to kill his wife, and said in his decision that there would have been a "careval atmosphere in the courtroom" due to the New Media.
Some people believe that the television series and the game film "On the escape" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court proceedings, which Mr. Haye's condemnation considers for a half century later, could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communications paths from the courtroom that were still unpredictable at the time of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to worry about the influence of the New Media in processes persecuted by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is randomly committed.
Professor Donohue said that some apple courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter issue is only one of many who present the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss in years and thus delay a condemnation.
For example, the defenders also claim that Mr. Hayes could have been prejudiced when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel tattoo photos during the jurors' selection.
Some of the Jurors have said, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their poet, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with awe.
The defendants say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution, and argue that the judge falsely exchanged a lawyer who had been a critic of the State prosecutor and that he had unacceptablely exercised pressure on the judgment when he had taken the unusual decision to release the Jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of the detailed reporting on the process may draw the greatest interest.
In a ruling which they submitted last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and had been discussed by the candidates during the campaign for the Governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously re-established the flames of emotions over the case.
"So a day-to-day inclination of the mediapieps, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "has one not experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even abroad."
Your focus on the reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct news were more spectacular than reports that are slower replacing, is a technologically hostile view that strengthens the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that application courts would often face the argument, social and technical changes needed the adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers are strengthening this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard was repealed due to the reporting, and made it clear that the New Media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "sheppard represents Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the divorce?
After a campaign of shameful words and negativeness this week, little courtesy has been breached out in Washington.
Is it the omering of a real two-party co-operation or a moment of illusion before you return quickly to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the Heads of the Congress did not bring a breakthrough into the major issues with which one had to deal with during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no more decisions were taken.
After all the things you hear, it was not a courteous discussion between two different sides or a respect for their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a party point collection.
The public meeting of the President's deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems to be clear that a close interaction over a period of months gives rise to mutual respect, which wipes the ideological gap, which continues to separate the members from each other.
This is hard enough to claim that it was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one is invited by the other sign of cooperation and compromise, while one is trying to consider the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a re-party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep as if you could expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that dominated over the past two years.
Whether it is about taxes, donations, health or quests, both sides are miles away from each other.
Lastly, the November elections voted in Washington for at least a short time.
"No question that the sound case has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections raise partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially in those which are on the agenda of the "lame duck session", Republicans and Democrats have hardly a choice to find than a solution."
Bush's tax reductions end the end of the year, and nobody supports this.
Both sides want to find a way to obtain some or even all, whether it is temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on the increase in unemployment benefits is expected, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favoured tax reductions for the rich while they refuse to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that you can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the new START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brooking Insistance warns that successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session must not impose a permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is called on in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even indispensable.
"After the things that have to be done, this short-term psychology will be transformed into confrontation," he said.
Weeping is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - leads to genuine cooperation.
"I see a lot of things that happens from today until 2012 as a pre-kamp, or shadowbox, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
How worried the Republican leaders may also be that they are too high poker, they know that they have to try to fulfil their promises to reduce the government's expenditure and to put off the health reform.
In the first reactions to the recommendations of the Commission on deficits, these lines will be clarified in the first reactions, which include tax reform and abolition of some taxes as well as the increase in pension age and the reduction of public expenditure.
The Vice-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have so much urged to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan for an official recommendation and they are fighting very much to come close to this number.
The biggest resistance is found in the chosen representatives of the body, as in financial matters, at least today, is little space or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans at the Congress.
The first struggle will take place next year in the form of party confrontations when the Republican Obama challenges the state budget, the taxes and the health system, followed later by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of the Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a sack gas as it has happened in 1995, then both parties must be careful about the public response.
Anyone who is condemned to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be a optimistic viewpoint.
Partiality and polarization are now larger than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Congress republics than then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties in 2010 view as a pure predecessor for a much more widespread choice in 2012.
As a result, many Americans may welcome the courtesy that is being shown this week.
On both sides, however, it will require much more effort to find a common necessity in the issues that are still separated from each other.
Transmitted US document ports Moscow as the port of corruption
The city's control is located in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it gives a part of the deposit money and the protection money it collects to the Kreml. So the American message in Russia reported in February in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are pressing high protection money so that they can keep their expensive living standards in Moscow, says it.
They collect money not only from legitimate business but also from organized criminal bands.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "Vertical of Authority" - takes its part of the money that the leaders are moving up.
The memo sent under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle to Washington was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names were edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the Mayor of Moscow, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that it had been cleared in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption claims over years, and he has won many blasphemy complaints against such accusations.
In September he explained to a Russian television broadcaster when he was asked for a documentation that suggested that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredible number of Russians believes that their society is corrupt. This has caused surveys.
But it is unusual that, as happens in the report of the Ambassador, individuals are called, and it is unheard that this is happening by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between the Government of Moscow and criminality has led some to call them "crashed" and conclude that the government acts rather as a clementocrate than a government," said the Memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "cryshna" (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, meaning "Dach" or "protection") that is as wide as the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-level structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Lushkov is at the top."
"FSB, MVD and Military are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lower stage."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues that the FSB cashes money from the largest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
One source, is said, "explained that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to get the protection of MVD and FSB (and not of organised crime), as they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs is no longer as requested as before."
The Memo notes that while the collection of the money is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don't pay find their business very quickly closed - due to some presumption.
Medvedev talked several times about combating corruption, but at the same time noted that he had made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go to the Kreml with bags that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucracy," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow Expert Commission, recently in an interview.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of violence, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Around the country, according to Indem, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked at place 154 of a recent study on the global perception of corruption by the NGO Transparency International (countries are listed from "at least corrupt" to "the most corrupt".
The revelation of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened after Moscow time late in the evening, will certainly cause failures within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be an opportunity for the Kreml to claim that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angry to the discovery that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to happen with such an arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a weakly illuminated, stressed classroom with dirty and deploying walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it, at the later Khmer Rouge Leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he cared for his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its grossity during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the slaughter", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodja, where he builds hospitals and bridges, which has developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer Rouge against the government, long-term followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims the public confrontation with people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that for the first time children of former soldiers tell the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community tribunal of the UN and Cambodja sentenced for the first time a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former chief of the famous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With all of these developments, the fear of the Khmer Rouge Veterans Alnlong Vengs grew, difficulty in their efforts to reconciliate and reintegrate into the Cambodia society.
"There is still refusal and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For her life was glorious under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of the wicked."
"It's splitting families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, rehabilitation or hunger.
When the Vietnamese attacked and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remains of the regime and his military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread distress until December 1998 when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla War from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodja, Ta Mok moved the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement supported by the UN in 1993 led to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to run over to the government, resulting in the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not abandoned, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in the prison of Phnom Penh in 2006, where he was waiting for his trial.
When their goans no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the decaying poverty of the rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although some of the elitary officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they put down their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have only very little benefit from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, struggled in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he moved down in 1998 to live as a poor rice builder.
"The life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is difficult because we have to take care of ourselves."
The running Khmer Rouge Tribunal has awakened concerns here too.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to put Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, before court.
The court's order is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the horrors, but it is not said whether it will pursue further actions beyond these four cases.
This has not contributed to relieving the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on In Chaem, 64 years of age, which had been district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007 she had told officers of the Cambodia documentation centre that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening, Chaem returned from work on the fields to their wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the dried grass, In Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court charged it, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has fled by the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would be more suspicious, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to go forward, Chhang Youk said from the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means merging the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put together these broken parts so that as everything can understand."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-sided "History of the Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are mistrust because they are not sure how many people are sentenced by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are getting somewhat influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
On top of the Dangrek Mountains, a bushes overwhelmed and with plastic damped road leads to a rectangle of black rust, covered with a roasted deck.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile seller at the edge of the street, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last rest place where she will put a busch mature bananas - in the hope that he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to collect non-wapable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for the global security of nuclear materials, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that one will no longer collect high-riched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Gipfel.
For years the US government had tried to persuade Belarus to gather unriched uranium and seemed to have reached a barrier last spring.
However, officials of the US government told the Washington Post that in the last two months two secret agreements with Belarus had been made to remove 187 pounds of weaponsable uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official staff who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Central Security Summit of the 47 Nations" from April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit of 2012.
"I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they want to have a seat in the Nuclear Security Summit (from 2012).
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation will never give up their uranium.
"As preserved high-rich uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is fundamentally weaponable, and less enriched uranium," said Lukehenko at the time.
"This is our raw material, we will not make any dirty bombs of it, and we will not sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first approach to removing the Uran Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly radiated, says officials.
It was loaded into a special train, which is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, says officials.
The second approach was decided on Monday and was carried out by aircraft according to the officials.
The US government pays for these efforts $14 million, with a large proportion of money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very cautious coordinated and agreed to build confidence" which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy working on the Global Risk Reduction.
The James Martin Centre estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of gun-fed uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of high-riched uranium.
According to the Joint Agreement, Belarus wants to resolve its camp until 2012.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, primarily because of the harsh disrespect of human rights.
But the statement from Wednesday suggests possible approximation.
"The progress of these global security issues welcomes the United States of America and Belarus to announce that increasing respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a key issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections of the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners over Spanish state territory to Guantánamo, as a telegram of the U.S.A. Ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents which Wikiileaks enclosed and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (per cable). It is added that the former Vice-President María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft survivors of Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which aid to dismiss human rights practices was charged in a thousand countries, including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken Zapatero away" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objections to the secret service flights across the Spanish state."
"You just want to be informed," not to be "unprepared surprised," reports Aguirre per cable.
The former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out that the Spanish Government "does not want to pay great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since it is in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, Vicente González announced the message that he would not block the judicial initiative to declassify the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Defence Minister on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdenful or sensitive information," said the ambassador after a discussion with the state lawyer.
Nevertheless, the United States was more concerned about the "evident coordination between the Spanish state lawyer and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Defense Ministry.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to act discreetly between governments," Aguirre complains.
At a lunch in March 2007, at which the Ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "though the Spanish judges were incrediblely thought of their independence and do what they consider appropriate," he instructed his employees to avoid "blazed rhetoric comments to let the tension run away."
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the approach of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the government of Zapatero, which could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, will have tolerated or deliberately ignored capital, even if such disclosures could negatively affect the government of the United States," he pointed out.
The child murderer confessed that she complained on the Internet about the "moving" of the motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in Galicicic Art"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she leads from small, she stops contact with a cosine and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
To understand this, you need to know her love life that reconstructs the daily ABC on the basis of witness statements of your family members.
In 1998, the 30-year-old Galician took up a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial woman.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, she became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his former man never let him perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she made a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Loyalty, a neighborhood.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the labour market, the young man stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their news, it can be noted that their relationship was breaking out and they separated.
In March 2008, she is on Menorca alone and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came to work."
"When I told him, he found it good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy for the whole day and not to be free, do and let what he wants."
Later she mentions a message that she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to which I can send you to the boy."
She complains, "If he doesn't like I'm leaving the boys with my mother, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May she speaks of the return to her village: "This week I'll go there, but I'll stay there until the 19th, because on 20th, I have to imagine a job if I don't want to lose it."
She explains she's taking her firstborn when everything's fine.
"He will be with whom he must be with, that is, with me. Never in life I will leave him again with someone except with my mother", a doubtful intention to consider their bad relationship.
There is another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was murdered on 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and the place likes him a little, but on the other hand, he needs to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"Where he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenses for the child girl."
On 17th, memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail.
On the 30th, one more: "The boy is fine. He's going to a summer course to learn Catalan."
By Víctor, her current partner, there's one: "He's shooting money for me."
On the Internet, in Anime and Mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called Muki, the prisoner.
"Terror a la gally (heading)".
The last man who lived with her, a hunted hunter overseer, explains to have consciences because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she hadn't told him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred to the province prison of Palma to Menorca by the Centre for Criminal Infants yesterday.
The compulsory defender, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the outcome of the case, "and she did not intend to harm the little one."
However, before she had been able to drink César in the bath and have stuck his body in a bag.
Defense and State Attorneys requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in the Congress and lost PSC 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following the significant increase in the votes and Members in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking at Parliament's elections - or not - and its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party has achieved in these elections is usually twice as high as those in Catalonia.
Thus the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 31.6.22 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this ascending trend - the result of the turnover of the PSC's share of vote and the commitment of the PP's electoral position - should continue, the PP's analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congress Members in the elections, while CiU would also win four (the PP has now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 Members (of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - at present she has three - while ICV could keep its Members or win one of them.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date of the municipal elections in May 2011. Even then the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to end the socialist presidency, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the City Council of Barcelona, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists do not achieve a majority or take back to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the republic debakel, it is not disregardable that this party will lose its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona where it has to reach 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its share of vote in the four capitals of the province and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's turnover, where they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida lies the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The Mayor, angel Ros, has a good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election struggle they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party could have a significant growth.
The PP is currently represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and seeks the formation of lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell concerned Al Qaida thousands of travel passes
Besides the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanians and the Nigerians who were arrested by the police of the Police Office of the Police of Barcelona were the thhihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different al Qaida groups, including the "motion to liberate Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - last was author of the attacks in Bombay, who demanded 106 deaths in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister gives these studies a great significance that goes so far that he is assured that with the "Operation Campai" the al Qaidas falsification device has been "saved" worldwide and "some of their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified and subsequently sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "fighters" could unlawfully cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The detected cell is not the only one of the Djihadist network active in Europe, so other European police units have also been involved in research, except the Thai investigation bodies. It is not excluded that in the EU's field, in the next few days, similar attacks will come to the same as those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanian Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another was executed in Thailand where the Pakistanian Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested, as well as the Thai countries Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They had led from Bangkok from the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - a part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - particularly stole tourists passports according to the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to show stamps.
In research circles, it is stressed that until now there were no connections between those arrested in Catalonia and the attack in Bombay, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the travel passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that several days before Catalonia's attack, several thousand dollars had been sent out by a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, later used by the members of the "Commando", which ended the life of 106 people.
The police have defeated a lot of documentation.
PP calls for a meeting of the tax agreement by Mas
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to present its conditions personally to the support of his office as Minister of the General, which do not differ from the ones already set during the election struggle and can be summarised with the priority of economic recovery and the failure of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial balance agreement that the regionalist leader proposes at the peak of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 Members who won her last Sunday - a number that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable. Because the candidate of the civil-regionalist Party CiU is required to have at least one of the opposition parties to vote at the time of its entry into force of the vote.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to join in the coming parliamentary elections at the Congress depend on a possible end to the PP. However, the discussions that are currently conducting with the other party leaders are about Catalonia.
As regards the PPC Party Chairman, it demands that "all discourses relating to Catalonia's sovereignty and independence" and an agreement on the financial balance between State and Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - and which the party leader of CiU would even submit to a referendum.
Both political leaders are meant to make the upbuilding political device of the regional administration smaller and to cut off the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the entry into force of Mas cover the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Care Home confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old home in Olot do not exclude that their nurse killed over eleven older people
The responsibilities of the old care home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they showed the damage to the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people he was responsible for during his work - to the institution.
The head of the old care home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced, "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible person (for the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only take a social loss because it had not detected the career's criminal acts in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé said that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and that he has continued to kill since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the Old Care House - because he suspected that no doctor had studied the dead personally, but the formalities due to their ages and diseases were phoned.
The leader of La Caritat disowned this point roundly and stated that "remaining measures could not have been the reason for the events at any time."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the dispute there were no indices for negligible acts of a person other than the accused person."
The dead angel was already baptized last 11 murders and explained that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and that one and a half months later the second old lady was murdered.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of different relief agents.
The director of La Caritat explained that the access of the staff to the medicines is only difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the refrigerator cocktail used the nurse at six of nine committed crimes to free the patients from their suffering by death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila lies and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them out from inside by giving them bleichlauge, as he said he had done in three women, who he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, the statements of the nurse are not believed, not even regarding the number of murders that could be much more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before court and that it does not make sense to change his procedure after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say they made themselves available for this reason and to inform the scope of these cases of justice.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
The risk deposits of the euro peer countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself and has hardly added the euro to points that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which recovers in the extent in which he reconsiders, but due to the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to withdraw our liquidity measures, which the ECB must make a withdrawal for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to purchase State debt, as it was ineffective, as well as the repeal of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and to maintain the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the programme for the purchase of bonds to continue and deliver a strengthening signal.
If the creative expectations are not fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets is rejected from yesterday and if we are strongly persuaded to withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Like the ECB meeting in May, where the Bank confirmed that it did not consider the purchase of State debt documents and collapse the markets, this history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed the teeth, and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, with which she provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government’s assets administration spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basic points throughout the curve and thus reflected a change in the perception of the markets according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated to be about 10 000 million short-term and possible further 15 000.
Although Ireland has completely lost his credibility after it had not recognised the problem with stress tests in July, the figures are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty in the framework of the rescue plan.
However, on the next Tuesday the government must receive parliamentary approval of its new budget, since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate in terms of the summit of the Heads of State and Government on December 14th, where political unity is asked to show that we play the same partition together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the nineth Sinfonie Beethovens.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the action plan to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Rental reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, degradation of state deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and employment procurement measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has added by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stocks.
Compared to February, the government and the Spanish central bank reacted quickly and convincing, and we benefit from the surprising effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year state liability that will benefit from the Trichet effect, so we are looking for a strong demand, which will eliminate all the doubts about our rehabilitation.
For Spain, the application of an aid plan would be a self-saving offer.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need, the treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March, and the interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without delay.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to Caesar's wife's motto: "Now it is not just the being, but also the shine."
Just courage, we'll do that!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen appealed to Vega Sicilia's Assembly at the request of his children.
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not float.
David Álvarez, founder of the company's cabinet, will fight the company meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on request of five of his seven children on 16th, as he considers it "absolutely necessity". His children will try to receive a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia wine.
David Álvarez and his children Jesus David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new legal chapter in their dispute for the control of a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not seem to be willing to give up the control of El Enebro's institutions in his case.
He was dismissed from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders meeting of 18 January of this year, which has already been registered in the trade register.
The Association of El Enebro, which was invited by Judge 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has created a new thunderstorm in the gun of the Alvarez family.
The call of the Judge to the Assembly is the only legal path that ensures the call for the Society.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is designed by David Álvarez as a "disappointed means of the applicants - his five children - to accept the unfairly declared congregation of 18 January through legal spit-findings, fraudulent acts and misuses", as official speakers explain.
This argument is the foundation for the contest of the congregation in the afternoon to explain it as "absolute insignificant".
In June, the same protagonists who swear in discreet silence tried to invoke a congregation on a judicial basis.
With El Enebro - assets company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of capital.
On the other hand, the founder of the service group, according to family protocols, demands the right to use more than 51% of capital.
This is the actual background of the matter that the judge has to decide on in the hearing to deal with the complaint for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been characterized by the speed of surprises and successes in this read universe.
At the beginning, nobody gave attention to the newling, and despite his steep ascending return during the last season, at the end track in the last November all sat on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without trying to reduce the ability of the German pilot and World Champion Sebastian Vettel or the power force of the Renault Motor, the "home weapon", which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in hands, has become a legend and thus created a victory team.
In fact, it is a powerful software for simulation of processes that the German company brought on the market in 2007 for purposes that do not have to deal with authors.
This computer program called PLM was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and highly precise instruments.
A faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid such errors and overflowing costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the aircraft of Sukhoi and the most famous Nissan use vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, director of the Siemens Industrial Department, explains that using this software in the Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that are detected on the race and in the tests.
Russian worm argues that 1992 worked at average ten technicians who were able to introduce up to three or four improvements during a season.
Today, 180 highly qualified young people are busy in Red Bulls team. With powerful EDV systems they carry out analyses and all possible changes in the race car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the components of Red Bull's race cars, except the engine for which Renault is exclusively responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are altered.
The changes, thanks to advanced production plants and high-tech autoclaves, can be transferred into reality by the virtual reality of the simulator within less than 24 hours.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that may spend a Formula 1 team for its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and production of its racing cars in a place located 50 kilometres from London.
It is two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The crew includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the World Championship Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the Energy Drink Producer puts in the services of his participation in the races, other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their knowledge is zero.
The engineering director of the work, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago, it was still possible to say that the progress in the F&E area contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share value has changed. The technology is 85 percent of success, while the pilot contribution is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV, because they are "not predictable gladiators".
HP will open its own stores with local operators in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) dedicated his first exclusive store in co-laboration with his partner Ront Reyes yesterday in Barcelona.
It is the first of a sales network of twenty businesses with each 80 to 100 square meters, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in the multi-market operation, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Deputy Chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, named the reconstructed store at Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which HP has worked for thirty years.
The North American Company Group intends to set up 200 sales offices in Europe by 2010, of which 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bukarest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbian). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to tell the coming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next goal.
The Deputy Chairman, also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for the opening of stores is always the same. It is based on a local operator with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American company group advises this and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products for touching). In Europe all shops will look equally.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the store staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchising system and pointed out that the exclusive sales network was intended to optimize "the customer service and the advice of small and medium-sized enterprises when buying and afterwards, even the packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes which sometimes take up up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as for private customers, because large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herroro explained yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rival in three years a million customers to 'cloud'
The management member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and prophesys the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it provides for a breakdown of the interest rates that the banks are trying to compensate with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to catch a million private customers in three years - an even existing professional.
Sabadell has found the way to take out the next three years and thus survive in a very complex economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guide plan in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without taking advantage of public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share of one million private customers - 700 000, if you withdraw the customers that will lose the bank - that is the great challenge that this bank faces, because it has so far dedicated more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their share of the market in private customers is 3.5 per cent, while the business customers are more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, speaking austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish goals during these difficult times, as the financial crisis has interfered with all the plans of the banks worldwide.
This year Sabadell will complete its four-year management plan Optima, which was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the Sparkasses are the main goal of the bank.
On a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed, in 2011, a "slow" year "with great range".
The manager assumes that Spain would only be "slowly" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to create "work" in two or three years - basic for the survival of the banks.
Although he assumes that the war of liabilities - which punishs the interest margins - will run away, the risk allowances which banks and savings banks must pay for their emissions to obtain liquidity will already be reduced to the price of loans.
"The subjects of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exercise pressure on loans."
"We didn't turn the hahn off, but the interest differences are very high," confessed Guardiola.
On Thursday Banesto already issued the order to their branch network to limit long-term loans and to increase interest differences (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently following the Stategie "to increase the fees", however "in a framework characterised by competition".
Sabadell's guide plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporative transactions.
He is not in vain assured that "greater companies are necessary in Spain".
"In the next year everything will change," he assures.
He emphasizes that the need for capital is currently rising "small" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will break down in red numbers.
He is of the opinion that the FROB can replace the money market in case of captain run-ups.
After assuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he dismissed the argument of some bankers who already prophesied a new liquidity crisis.
It emphasizes that nothing can be circumvented, but in contrast to the incidents in June, short-term funding can be achieved through repo transactions and thus the crisis.
CECA excludes a second merger wave of spare funds
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility that a fusion wave of the spare funds could be achieved and stressed the speed to restructure the industry.
When the concentration process of the Spanish Sparkasses began, several spare funds were not involved in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassen Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers are completed. Cajasol's involvement in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was rather adjustments."
"The most part is finished. It may be that we have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all the operations."
On a breakfast organized by the Aragonien Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process was "to be carried out as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limit, which was established in earlier times, not now, within the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings funds with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with each 75 500 million is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Baseler Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta explained that "there were a number of unsatisfactory opinions on the slowness of the process that revealed our idleness and insensitivity" because "Banco de España urges us to complete the process timely before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financial systems of Europe and "probably" in the world and added that those who doubt this were doing this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic economy we need to be "no concerns" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be carried out as quickly as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had carried out the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time conditions for the whole European Union.
The tensions on the markets have resulted in a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, regulation of time-working companies or repealing 426 euros for unemployed people who do not pay unemployment, up to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of Baraja and El Prat airports and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the responsibility of the current crisis.
How are these actions to be understood?
It should be precluded that Merkels' position is not a mistake of their public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective for the design of our future, which collides with the maintaining of the old traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the oppositions in Europe, Germany begins to speculate about three possible paths from the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south, had to leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of the Deutsche Mark - although it is currently more like Science Fiction - is supported by a large majority of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
Thirds: a conversion of the euro according to German proposals. This means more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that are violating the requirements; possiblely the payment of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been drawn up for a while, so there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, as well as the IMF as the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German Government took a constitutional reform from the army to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of distinguishing between what Germany considered necessary (strenge tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the central European country as Merkel was painfully pushing out the decision on the rescue of Greece.
This was strongly criticized at that time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion was absolutely against the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last October, Merkel has come back with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union agreements to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time obliged private borrowers to carry part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it promoted the Ireland crisis and all the following.
But her proposal, although something is lost, has been adopted, and in the next few months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed it.
It tells everyone that, even though unwanted measures are now to be taken, the old way of functioning the euro will no longer exist from that date.
In 2013, the year of birth of a new currency will be in which the counterfeit countries can be severely punished, forced to declare themselves unable to pay and, in this case, to take part in the private sector.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, measuring consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and positive external salads.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the payment balance, as stated by Spain in bombing times, will simply not be taken.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad to not understand it.
It is not only about reducing the state deficit until 2013 to three percent.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will move into more peace.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood that too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis, to create order in their own house, has prepared itself their way.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it doesn't look like it would change something.
Among the possibilities considered, we have to leave the euro area fully stopped with few serious countries is not to exclude.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulations
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to deal with a sanction.
The presumably excluded by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink was forgotten about whether it was an unportable action or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before playing (your team had already gained clearly) and played several fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will fulfil the prescribed sanction in the next game against the Auxerre and will thus enter the next game without cards.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished the trainer of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provokation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather often found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but in this sport - rules.
Part of the incoming debate on the presented case is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (which in his hymne preciousness and honor and in other times had punished his players for similar events) played the main role, and to the dramaization by Mourinho, which added a episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provoking technician.
In any case, the debate concerns whether this practice does not explicitly contradict the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions constitute a rule-sharing. In fact, this approach is consistent with the statutes of sport, but it seems to be a way of dealing with its sense.
In this case, the damage caused by sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical inverseness of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the unjustified benefit of the opposing players from the opposite team.
The paradox of the act of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under false gambling or rule-sharing, because the survival of the rule has not been carried out secretly in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as noticeable as possible to be punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and accepted the sanction joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage the opposers have drawn from the deliberate fouls.
Here it should be highlighted that the rival has not been brought into an unfavourable situation or benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is not also a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, as the team could at any time exclude. In addition, the players receive a sanction with this approach and go to the second card cycle in which they are excluded for card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle.
This does not make it clear whether it is really a advantage.
Finally, such practices do not contradict the sports spirit, which also involves strategic decisions in order to benefit from the regulations as far as possible.
In this case, the players did not want to deal with sanctions (that would actually be a clear case of regulation), they would rather choose when they were subject to it.
They made a strategic decision to escape or flee without a punishment.
Although the limit between invention and regulatory environment is blurred, I believe that this is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that the polemics have been caused by two factors: because it was about two self-exceptions and because of the type of provoked rule transfer.
The damage to the principles of sport is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offensive for customer catch for group Christmas evenings in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops a lawn of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December.
The self-payed celebrations are widespread. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turron and the Christmas lottery, there are also groups evenings that lead to Barcelona's restaurant and recreational oxygen. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they solve an open price to capture the customer segment that represents the great mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirm the entrepreneurs and associations in question.
In order to make the booking even more complicated, the calendar (Silvester falls on a Friday) has left all orders in the week of December 13, with the result of a lawn of dinner reservations on two tops (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped the group evenings for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to quit this tradition, many workers pay it from their own pocket.
As the economy is, lowest prices are demanded, the Chairman of the Gaststättengremium of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs, confirms.
Until now, the representative of the Dachverband is unable to predict how the holidays will look this month.
"The people are thinking about it for a decade before booking."
"They want to go out, but they pay great attention to the prices," he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who " offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers save in crisis times, which is why prices are most demanded by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it is found that the evening of December 17 leads the supplier to collapse.
The Soteras group says that the demands for this Friday with a view to spending less than 30 euros would be trees. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
In another leading group, Andilana, who has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the ownership of the calendar has led to preferable reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for each taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which leads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, optimism will not be lost after the revenues have been flown back since the second quarter and good, although in a few days concentrated views for the Christmas business will be seen.
Sources of the company group point out that the 18th day will also be overactive with friends who celebrate Christmas.
A Christmas menu was added to the six group menus for 30 euros or more than price heat. It has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in turn want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, you can also see green sprays spraying, so the employees are invited again, which makes the impression that the group foods are again in the upholstery.
Apart from the Dachverband Fecasarm (with mergers such as the Kneipen, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the Deputy Chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel, and notes that the reservations in total are quite "living" although the customers "take out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebration had not fallen down, no matter who pays.
The Pakistanian nuclear programme causes great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Disclosures of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department revealed by the Internet portal Wikiileaks confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistanian nuclear programme Washington.
On the edge of the clarifying and safty details that provide documents on the content of the discussions and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between both countries is not strengthened in nuclear safety, but, on the contrary, "reduces" and that the instability Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster Rhytmus than any other country".
Especially the nature of the Pakistanian nuclear programme - that the weapons are not composed, but are stored in order to impaire their destruction in a possible attack, Washington prepares sleepless nights.
The following risks include the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the former Head of the National Security Council, James Jones, "The nearness of some nuclear installations to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable distribution of nuclear material and the appreciation of transport of nuclear materials".
The large number of persons imposed in the nuclearsenals and the rocket programs is not only considered by the United States but also by Russia to be excessive and reason to take care.
"Pakistan has to set up strictly believed personnel to monitor nuclear plants; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to advocate people who cooperate in nuclear or rocket programs," said Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his North American official colleagues.
New documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that cooperation between the USA and Pakistan is leaving behind nuclear distribution and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message describes communication with Pakistan as "fruit-responsive" explains: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive any answers to assistance offerings or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "through the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as soon as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit to the chief army leader General Ashfaq Kayani to "clarify to the responsible person" that "Pakistan's army has to set up his silent support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new entrances.
Interpol gives a red warning for the persecution and invention of assange.
All that hangs with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are only difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" for the "invention and persecution" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrangement for arrest.
Moreover, it is not new, it comes from 20 November.
It has nothing to do with the last release of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australians have to face in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, insists, "the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
Already on 20th, the international police authority established in Lyon, France, issued the order on request of Sweden, but it was not announced by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after receiving the power.
So the things are. The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find assangs, "to arrest and deliver it provisionally."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person affected by a red warning, many Member States, according to the organisation, consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as it is the case of Sweden and England where Assange is likely to stay.
Assange's lawyers, who published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the exit from Sweden and was compared by the state lawyer, who was awarded the lawsuit of Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security director of Stalin, who received the appropriate approval.
"This is like a hunting, not like a legal persecution," is charged in the letter.
While the world looks for him - and his mother from Australia is innocent of her son - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday he gave a interview to the head of the magazine Time via Skype from an unspecified place. He requested the withdrawal of the US State Secretary, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be demonstrated that it was responsible for the order of North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus breach international agreements signed by the United States, they would have to withdraw," he said.
His opinion was sentenced yesterday by the White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, who referred to the request for withdrawal as "smart and absurd".
"I am not sure why we should put value to the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the sender CNN.
Obama himself has a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new documents.
The attempt of President Barack Obama's speaker to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions that the conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming in these days.
The Congress Abgeordnete Peter King, who will be chaired in the National Security Committee of the House from January, has invited the State Department to examine the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "to convey their funds and to follow anyone who supports them or contributes."
Tom Flanagan, consultant of Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to withdraw his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama had to turn him into a target disc and use an unmanaged plane or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former governor of Arkansas, and possible candidate for presidentship.
"Everyone who has sent through information in the government, he is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not executed is a little too mild punishment," he explained to the sender Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with an eyewitcher
The Republican leader authorises the party to have a secret vote on his continuation in the Office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the General Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe in order for the twentieth time of an internal upheaval in the series of elf Members and half of the votes in the elections.
The Chairman of the Party is aware that his threat of withdrawal is not sufficient to the nearby members of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is weakened today as its Mentor itself and will not control him the same head breaks as other former streamings.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra, with a eyewitcher, attempts to win the new critics, which would ensure his position until the next municipal elections.
At the beginning, yesterday, the ERC's more than 200 regional members would be able to express secretly on its remaining in the Office.
With electoral notes, not with lifted hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss a penalty to the president, they could do this without having to fear repression.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of splitting and the impression of submission among his person.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel with half of the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added without mention of percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod neighbours require more from the president than only the party to make his office available. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós controls the top body of the conventions.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Board of Directors on a plan of action from now to May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the direction will be presented to the Council on 18 October to vote.
Their intention is to pay for Puigcercós. On the contrary, he promises to post the Congress in the autumn of 2011, what the party's head already thinks is a fact.
The Chairman of the ERC believes that the "Polyphony" harm of stability and he seeks forever to enable the organisation to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the official Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the holder of Innovació thought it was a fact that the Chairman of the Party was supported "in exchange against different goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the forefront.
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the involvement of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally give up the principle of the whole assembly as a functioning method.
In this way, he fights a reform of the Statutes which will allow the conventions to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcercós' team, who already struggled at the last two conventions, is as busy from the end of the whole assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the 2008 preliminary meeting, the party leadership was commissioned to review the principle of the General Assembly at a convention to address the reform of the Statutes.
This date is still out, as information about the internal rest of the past years was not advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors on the ground, the time could have come to retake and finish this matter forever.

China maintains its objectives to reduce greenhouse gases
China's representative at the COP16 stated that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at the COP16.
In his first public appearance on the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country would have made enormous efforts to reduce carbon tracks and to change its industry.
He argued that in the last four years his country invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but would work in this matter together with the international community.
He explained that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, the establishment of institutions and supporting pilot programmes.
In all aspects progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which included the objectives of reducing emissions of gases.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China the authorities of the states had cooperated with those of the Central State and the communities in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
He also carried out, has already launched or completed several years of plans, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those that received money from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme for effective use of energy, which has been introduced over the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
It also runs a province-level project on climate change, another project to exchange traditional glue bears through energy savings and further to weaken and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government consultant on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be far greater than generally accepted.
He showed that the per-head emission of greenhouse gases in China covers six tonnes per person, while it is 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a total of nine percent contribution to environmental pollution.
Similarly, it makes unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent over the last five years, and a further step will be made by 2020, he explained.
Legal Excludation Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former panist party chairman has the right to turn to the National Commission of the Rules of Procedure and to demand what the right to him was to do.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion was Manuel Espino Barriento's right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and to demand what the right confided to him.
In an interview that took place before complaining Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision made at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Herr Espino has the right to apply to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case to a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance with the candidates of the Presidency had never been sitting at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened from the internal vote on the next 4 and 5 December, where his successor was elected.
"The (a alliance in 2012) is a subject that was never on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a suggestion for the municipal election, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he explained.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back to 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the or the best chairman, the Acción Nacional for the next three years, and therefore surrender the Stafetts "to those whom the Council would decide."
"I'm completely unanimous and open there. I would be proud to delegate each of the five to the office of the party chairman."
He predicted that in the last elections of 4 July the party's breakdown would reflect in the next elections, although "it is not time to think of 2012."
"Now it is about supporting the governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments, which came from allians between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, were to bear the flags and watched throughout the country. Therefore, "many hopes and desires are put into them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the requirements."
When he was consulted about the criticism of PRI at the president Felipe Calderón for his disc course in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called on the followers of the PRI to think about the six-year period of the former president Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the cabinet," he confirmed.
He believes that the holder of the Federal Government expresses such expressions as those he could make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there is no mouth ban and even less a censur.
Obama uses Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and insist on the adoption of this Law", the President of the United States twisted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported country-wide mobilisation to support the Dream Act - Law on Legalisation of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, call your senators and insist on the adoption of this law," twittered Obama.
Its short release contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document, which invites the public to enter into contact with its senators, as the voting of the law is at the earliest.
"With your voice we wait for, the time has come to listen to you," he emphasizes.
The message was distributed after the 42 Republican senators insisted to block all votes for every law, except the extension of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Concerning the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said that he trusted that, once the tax theme was solved, a timetable for the other projects could be set up.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that tax matters must be dealt with before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and afterwards we can plan the run-out of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would ask for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - Law, with which the initiative to legalise undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from the next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American dream, would legalize about 800,000 young people who emigrated to the United States when they were not 16 years old, during the last five years living in that country and registered in a higher educational institution or army.
But the defendants of the Law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, so they are required to vote on the votes of a handful of Republicans. At the moment, the organisations of the speakers of this project organise an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats of whom the majority support the Dream Act have 58 seats.
However, one of them said, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defendants of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to turn the initiative back.
Among the most conquered Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who backed the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained not to support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken for the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his attitude.
Although the representative house has another version, the analyticals agree that the Dream Act in the Senate faces the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger into the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used the subtitle of her question at this occasion (on another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "takes us into trouble", the Argentine writing office spucked sweet to the audience, which was mainly composed of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round of table that was moderated by Marisol Shultz, at the Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and the Shultz then marked as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for to learn what is a "wound", and goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not receive any answer, but suggestions for the guides of her story.
She leaves the infectiousologists, "Thulding is not my strength, perhaps it's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approximation to the traumatologists who robbed the breath in the middle of the walk, and who explains that wounds are not a scientific concept, the psychoanalytic is the secret: "the wound is really open, the symbolic is the narbe."
The main figure of the story sweeps lightened and concludes that "from the wound only learned that it is really open and not existing". However, it is convinced that the desire to the language and their traps are mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful story he called 'Lob of invention' and in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound, but is discovered.
With suggestions of magic realism, he tells about a famous magic who touched the clouds, brought far-reached men back or restored the deed lost by a girl. The story made a turn of turn and reported about America, the great Roman, which was not missing from the beginning of his own chronists, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the flood of the stories that the conquerers were told.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers) ridiculed the presumptuous witnesses who appeared in the true stories, but in other ways, the history of America would never have been told - with instructive power that even came away from the embarrassment."
However, he emphasizes, "is it the crazy and liars who think things best", and there, reality and lie approaches each other, where you no longer know what side the story belongs to where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the series, the writer commented and praised the diversity of interpretations to which the FIl's invitation to the round table 'The finger in the wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican devoted her contribution to the great wounds of social violence, which affects her country - like all Latin America - as a result of the fight for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, not intentionally planned commitment," she explained, after emphasizing that literature is communication and liability that builds up between the author and the readers as with a "chemical reaction".
On the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero decided, whose contribution also emphasized "these finger of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-living world, the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also run out to dogmatism, and will forget, "that behind any confirmation there is a little no and behind any disbelievation a little yes."
"In order to be in possession of our thought and reality, we need to nuance: And Nuancieren often meant to put your finger into the wounds and to laugh those who feel much better when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in advanced ideas without nuances, and also the mighty who prefer to divide the world into black and white he noticed and invited to discover the sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first track
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the Duell between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end game, two different styles, which are specified by their respective trainers, and whose meeting characterized by counterparts reflects in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he experienced Ops and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has stayed well, so this opportunity is of very special importance for him.
The Argentinian has played up with the medal to the second champion, he has remained a step behind the victories and surprisingly, he has carried out final games with the same team in succession.
The Santist Stratege reached the first final game as a trainer at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' when del Morelia had the tricks in hand with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duell that he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', when they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to reappear a relapse since the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went out after 210 minutes of play, but at the eleven meter he came forward with 3-1 and got two possibilities to sign his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted from the accident again and free from the evil magic to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to become champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection I am going to come to me, and therefore the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," commented the taxman when he was asked about the lost final games.
The last final game has remained strongly in memory of him, assures him that he has learned much from it: "The only teaching we can draw from it is that until the arbitrator doesn't piep the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared to separate with two 11 metres, and I believe that this is a doctrine until the game isn't finished, there's no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by eleven meter shoots, it does not worry, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the eleven meter shooting, you want to finish in the regular playtime, but sometimes there is no alternative, and you must be prepared to be prepared in the previous tournament, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervosity or the violent effort to keep the title in your hands, which left us something for this end game, and we hope that it will not come this time."
It is in Romanso power not only to be a second champion and for the first time to cost the glory that the titles bring.
The United States amends the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must present themselves before their discussion at the Consulate at the services centres for visa application; the costs will be reduced waiting times.
From 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying a visa are changing in the United States' Embassy and the Consulates.
In the new procedure, the majority of applicants must present themselves before their discussion in the consulate at the services centres for visa application (ASC, the initial letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which will be verified by the consulate before the discussion.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total costs for the deployment of the visa, because it is no longer necessary to pay the date agreement, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is delivered separately.
The applicant shall make only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterparty to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visa with application (including visa for time workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to talk in the consulate, they only have to imagine themselves at the nearest ASC where they are presented their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the discussion in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo must no longer pay the service charge of $26.
Further information on the new visa application procedure is available on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the fund of alien life
The North American Space Agency invited a press conference to present tomorrow a found that will have an impact on the search for living in all.
The National Air and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States announces a astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, which could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The fund is presented tomorrow at a press conference at the NASA seat in Washington by astrobiology experts. It is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When calling the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a surveillance found for the search for extraterrestrial life", which resulted in speculations in experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that it could exist in hostile environments so far considered inhabitable, human beings. The hypothesis was raised that they could transform into intelligent creatures - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it is a microbe found on the grounds of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in a environment that was considered too toxic for all predictable forms of life, as the lake is highly arsenic.
In any way, the microbie uses arsening as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, the chances are increased that other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere could have a similar life.
If these organisms alter the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is demonstrated that "a real life form, there is another life form that differs from the one we know."
The Space Agency announces the actual scope of its fund tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference.
At the conference, the Geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who examines the possibility of life on the Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the Titan (the largest moon Saturns) studying the question whether its chemical composition is similar to that of the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the Organ Law on the Convention, the two-party system was introduced, they complain.
The 60th Legislatural period had just started, and already a opposition block was installed, instructed by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who were independent. The four asked the following: the entry of the two party system into the chamber.
Before the start of the introduction session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the Organ Law, since it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled the convention.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, co-ordinater of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency cited by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-presidents.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political margin with these reforms.
He explained that in the next days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the schedule. They went out of that political will and if they did not have it, they would be unfair again by both parties, with which the opposition coalition would end.
"In this way (opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions which do not even take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were matches with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be established.
It cannot be authorized, he continued that after being monopolist, the Congress should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of the reform of law that in the Congress a eternal two-party system should be ruled."
"From the beginning, this group begins with five Members and they talk to other colleagues so that they can become more," said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained in reply to PAN and PRI that the Congress had currently transformed into a 'proof' for two.
"In the past, it was only one party, now they split it up to two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the Members and to assign them their place to the negotiating tables.
"It must not be left outside because of top decisions five which are likely to be nine Members. The five who are currently being seen as divided into different groups have decided to agree to take our place on the negotiating table, because because of the reform that has been carried out and devoted by the others, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 more peso for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check on some 200 000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This is the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical materials in the second half of the year, 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this check was issued on a amount of 200.144.56 Peso with number 9258447 on the last 16 November with the purpose of the use of "computing open accounts".
The treasure champion Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent in advance that more money from the community would go to this supplier. She is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sold for excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount that is still owed to her and consequently the number of cheques that are still issued for the benefit of Camacho Palazuelos.
"It wasn't bought with her, it's just paying the debts, as with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
In the last quarter of the year, the last cheques were "appeared": 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by the law, if a company is questioned by the ASE to prevent other administrations from applying for their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be re-established.
After the review of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers on July 25, the newspaper Noroeste was announced that from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of the Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also businesses with Jumapam where they entered cheques in value of more than 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the bad state of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the crash of a foreign tourist in the invasion of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán asked to pay particular attention to the authorities, the areas in a bad state and a bad picture to the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Sales Association of the Zona Dorada Zona, recalled that at various occasions, it was required to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that the tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the roads and walks had negative effects, as the tourists came to slope and saw the disorder, which they would turn to the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day, and they don't worry about how much money you lose. Otherwise they would not do the construction work in this way slowly and planlessly."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the crash of the tourist would have made attention to the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance work from the city's sides.
"The community must take over its responsibility and avoid this again. How to do so? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything in the afternoon," he explained.
"We are desperately waiting for a clean city. For not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, also we inhabitants have a right to a clean living area. The city administration needs to change its strategy to maintain the city in a good condition."
"There are other places that also look unpleasant and unfinished," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito by Mazatlán."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product needs to be offered, a city that cleanses its beaches and roads, and the tourist attractions constantly guns," he added.
"These arrangements have not been given enough attention, and this kind of incidents reveals what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, sub-secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be properly used and caused a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that had to be brought to frontman along with the city. To make the city clean, orderly and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural places, which first had to be cleaned and cleaned, to make them attractive to tourism and to implement them to the inventory with which we acquire for this destination.
IP requests results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that the Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business industry calls for a worthy Parliament, free from agreements between parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
Last night, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM. This is a total of 40 people representatives.
The new members of the Congress are expected to make a clean work, feel obliged to the society and to the different social groups that are required for a responsible parliamentary work and not to repeat the same pattern of partiality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of CCE Co-ordination Council, proposed that the new Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
"We hope that the Members are truly exercising their right to act freely from agreements between the parties, because it is usual that they make agreements with which they represent their own interests, with which they are transforming themselves into coreval compatriates of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care of their carrying out a trustworthy work and working for the society and their groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they promote economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism sector, he urged the new Members to give the necessary job in the public budget to promote the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the twenty-two resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings exchanges and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro industry."
The tourist projects need to be allocated money, the state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King Is Searching
Puppen, cars, bicycles and other toys wish the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For the parents, it will be difficult for the next three kings day to meet these wishes, because the household is not more and not less than 12 people and a goat bowl.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar give them the toys and clothing that they so long for.
The family lives a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from the hand in the mouth, because the father has no firm work.
"Something times are hard because my husband has no job, but we sell Mandarines and Potatoes... Even in the afternoon I go with the Gören to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaide would like a puppe or bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wishes a barbie pop.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has wanted a 'monster car' for a while and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus proposes Cayetana clothing in size for one-year-old.
"(José Alfredo) said to me, "I would like this monster so much," but I answered him, "Let us wait, boy," because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size12 of the ten-year-old Isaiah's size 10 during the eight-year-old Miguel size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help achieve the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Healing King will be searched' by spending a toys or cash in the Noroeste Reception Hall.
14 Sustainable Drug Dealer arrested
On Wednesday, the 10 house searches were carried out in the administrative region of Estria in the context of the destruction of a production and sales network of cannabis.
Fourteen persons were arrested and will be charged with different charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, at which places predominantly would have served the manufacture of drugs.
"Current 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of Hashish, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated," stated Louis-Philippe Ruel, speaker of the security police of Quebec.
Overall, eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke of the men who were considered to be the principal dragon of the drug ring.
The arrested persons should have appeared in Sherbrooke for hours after their arrest before the court building.
They could, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis, their possessions for sale purposes, the complot and the service of crime.
These house searches had been carried out as a result of a long-term research activity, which took place for more than one year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," explained M. Ruel.
About the 70 police officers of the regional investigation unit Estrien of the security police of Quebec, Sherbrooke, and the police authority of Memphrémagog had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be persecuted problemlessly
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, is to deal with the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be stumped into all prospects after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I'm leaning up against this charter."
"I hold with a party that has put you to your feet," explained Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting before the meetings.
The Liberals claimed that the draft law, which permits to hold each person who is identified as a transportation of illegal immigrants for up to one year, infringes the Canadian Constitution of Justice and Freedom.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the draft law, as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government is doing," explained M. Duceppe.
The criticism regarding the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has rejected the critics who demand that their party did not act steadily enough against the secret immigrants.
"The Neo Democrats agree to take measures against the blind passengers, and this is what we are trying to do by passing another draft of law, the C-35", said Chow.
We therefore do not support the draft law of the Conservatives because he seeks the debt of refugees and keeps children captured for at least one year," said Chow.
The Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties to play with the politics and to ignore the Canadians' will.
"The Canadians invite the Members to note that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these crimes affecting Canada and treat the country as a football abortor."
"You expect Canada to take harsh action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any confidence voting on its draft law which could have led the country to elections that the government had rejected.
However, a conservative has said to the QMI Agency that the government would call for a vote so that any opposing Member would immediately explain to his voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collision by Jean Charest, many observers continue to require the establishment of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this topic last January.
The metropolis have had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the announcement of Wednesday has surprised more than one.
It must be said that in spite of Robert Dutil's presence, this measure has not been discussed at the very least at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Québécois Party qualifyed this announcement in pointo public security as "smart from the hat" and "adjusted solution" at a table end.
Minister Dutil, on the other hand, turned to those who fear that the political power had too much influence on the questioned, future unity.
"You will see the result when we will announce it," he pleased to confirm.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest urges to prevent the education of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to be able to form an investigation committee is the withdrawal of Jean Charest," explained Yves Boisvert, teacher for ethics and policy systems at the ENA (state of the university for training of high-administration officials).
In order to get out of this sackgasse, he proposes that Quebec adopt a special mandate for financial auditing, so that it can carry out research on corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to expand the mandate of testing," he decided.
He also believes that the Quebec of verification control could grant the same power as Commissioners, which would allow you to commit people to the statement.
The creation of a standing unit is not the only project in the boxes of the Government of Charest.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better oriented to this type of crime.
This demand comes from the supreme prosecutor of the operation of Marteau, who has informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisdiction is not clear in this type of criminal prosecution.
Vic Toews, State Minister for Public Security, on the other hand confirmed his colleague of the Justice, Rob Nicholson, currently putting up certain novelities relating to this dossier.
During the Operation Printemps 2001, which covered the groups of motorcycle police, 131 persons were arrested, although the criminal law had not been novelled.
As a result, Ottawa has implemented the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several river runs remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that have been overwhelmed in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, the administrative region of Mauricie, it came to an earth crush on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening, another earth’s crutch occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A street has collapsed in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfall from 40 to 70 millilitres of rain has fallen into several regions.
Between 20 to 40 millimeters of decay was expected here according to the regions until Thursday.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
In total, up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen.
Since these rainfalls are still to be added to the snow melting that has already been collected in certain subdivisions, the violation of several water runs is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service called for warnings about the high-water alarm regarding the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the region of Lanaudiere.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of high water surveillance and continue to be monitored.
In the region of Lanaudière, the violent defeat of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon have moved to pass.
In Saint-Calixte a bridge was continued due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the violation of certain lakes has caused the closure of several streets, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service continues to be ready to alarm and monitors the situation precisely, says Security Counciler Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Highwater Center issued the warning of the strong rise of several rivers, especially by Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially corrected
The Quebec radiomoderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial relapse before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) due to his controversial statements on social care and Haitians as well as his outgoing speech on radio.
The CCNR represents the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team would have the right to express their own opinion, but certain statements would have "inadequate information on social care and unlawful negative representations of the Haitians, as well as such an unhooped speech that is not appropriate for the broadcasting over the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which involves the spread of the names of two persons who committed suicide, violates the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints concerning the comments made during the broadcasting periods of 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was submitted as a result of a complaint by the "Front community of the personnes assistées socials du Québec".
The activist organisation complained that the amounts referred to in the consignment were unfair.
The moderators should provide solid information rather than misleading information.
Concerning the topic of suicide, Moderator Stéphane Dupont had the view that suicide was a expression of nakedness.
The majority of the supervisory board members had concluded that the communicated message was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the relevant consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" would have circumvented a sensitive topic in a family-right and appropriate way."
Hence, he was not occupied with any tadel toward his person.
The last dispute was the statements related to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a medium-effective dispute talk that had caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moder had explained not to have donated for the Haiti help, since it was not safe to know if the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments have not been misused, but that their cumulative effect presents an unlawful negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already borrowed my three-day suspension penalty in this matter."
"My act has been virgin for one and a half years," explained the modernist.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board insists on the spread of an uncovered expression.
In all cases, the CHOI FM acted as broadcasters "without its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, had to have announced his decisions once during the main time of sending within a period of three days, are small.
A King of the King Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete that brillates in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in the kickbox and in the Thai box, is now looking for new challenges to the Tatami and the boxing rings of the world.
"I started fighting sports in Algeria 12 years ago, such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxen," said Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to continue to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the battle of all sorts, because for those who present the soil struggle, as it presents the mixed battle art, there are no competitions in North America."
Recently, the employee of his sign as a security officer and the UPS employee had given his rivals bad news, in which he was held two golden medals of the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) in the World Championship of the Amateur in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 23 and 30 October.
"I won the victory in the categories of the full contact Kickboxen and the Thai box," he explained.
"I am preparing myself on the worldpocal in San Shou in China."
"Their fighters were invited from each category who had placed themselves among the first four at the last world championship."
"I babe in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"2005 I became back in Vietnam."
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China on the fifth place, while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's worth mentioning that I made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplinary from China, where fists and footsteps are allowed as well as soil throws.
The two fights usually play on a platform, less rarely in a boxing ring.
The most renowned box fighter that has come from this type of fighting sport is the American Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, well known in the world of fighting arts.
If Nacer had only a single event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super-Turnier "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most viewed in China," explained the sympathic poundary.
"It is a little like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium of Thailand).
"That was a super experience."
In the semi-final of his category (80kg) he had won his first struggle before he then lost in the final.
"The one who conquered me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of halffinals meet each in their category's final."
"Then the winners of each category offer their foreheads to crown one champion, the king of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant project planning companies 450 million dollars in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert water power project.
In the middle of this Lawine of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the main share, namely that of the project leader, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tendering.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was created in 2004 as a accompanying appearance of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector, to overcome its responsibility, this important hydroelectric project of a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" held the luxury contract without a public tender.
For the Québécois Party, the withdrawal of company consortia represents a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of competition and increases in prices.
"This is a new way of a carded game, and the competition is weakened."
"This means that instead of carded games, you are now doing in a secret way in open form," said Sylvain Simard, member of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how public interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by deciding that this contract had been a carded game.
"I remain faithful to my line," she betted by strengthening the fact that the PQ had been "unreasonable" and it was "missing her hardness".
She said, "It's the least," that the PQ apologize.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary bond that allows two or more companies to bundle their experts in terms of an invitation to tender for a complex project.
The "Eastmain" project shows a high complexity level in terms of its work scale.
The construction procedure is in progress and is supposed to be set up by 2012.
However, the Treaty was forgiven without a competition struggle; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception in relatively simple projects.
According to the newspaper Le Devoir last week, the model of the consortium is subject to government communications in the field of construction engineering and consulting.
A short survival of the Quebec Company Register allows to designate more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of persistent duration.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and of which there are several dozens, leads to one and the same legal person, namely to Dessau.
As regards the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a special dynamic of labour force and that Hydro-Québec has in particular invoked this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made the nose trick about the fact that the contract on the project management was approved after agreement.
"If you make an invitation and there are few candidates, your prices will be faster to the height."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this Mart and tell you, you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people", laporte confirmed.
This contract granted to the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received by the Québécois Party.
The contracts were approved by either the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineer and consultant contracts, companies or branches, including resource laboratorys, were approved between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had signed 22 contracts, Genivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account their participation in "Energie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They totally amount to $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies who form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) were well known to be the "Parti libéral du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had made it clear that the PQ was equally linked to the companies they "financed" before she clarified that it was rather their leadership.
Barometer Advocate Consumption - The "green" label is not trusting
Greener, but unsufficient.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but also in the characterized brands or eco-labels to control its choice.
Damage, although it bathes in a medium-effective universe, where information for a more responsible consumption only embraces as follows: the barometer responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain, an inadequateness that makes itself known as a brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed that was held yesterday.
Although they have driven the consumption of the so-called socially durable products in 2010, the Quebecs still seem to have little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of the Quebec population admit, in fact, to give little faith to the environment of the companies as well as to the green business advertising, the measuring instrument that is cleared by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another find: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates added to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves as environmentally conscious, the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this subject is taken seriously of only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently experienced by nearly one third of the Québean consumers.
In fact, the employee and doubtful nature of the information were duplicated by 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified on the side of the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of the Quebecs faces mistrust with the given performance of the green products and services that they are endeavored to put on their hands.
According to another communication, more than half of the consumers had changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases in traders of their district and favoured the purchase of foods built in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of the environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by caring for animal protection.
However, social and ecological consciousness appears to be in front of its car, so the barometer: just 28% of the Quebecs have indicated to use public transport in 2010 or to prefer the medieval center to demonstrate their environmental interest.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive question of conduct were also favoured by the clichés.
State liabilities for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive liability.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Cultus to take over the Daniel Langlois biocomplex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent to reply to his actual cineastic function, does not seem to receive what they have requested.
Although the government has accepted to involve itself in this matter, it is under its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a liability in less than the initially expected amount that could create an existing solution on beneficial conditions, at least in view of the sources that can be obtained from the state of rumour.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the bite request has been re-established summarically down.
A proposal, together with an action plan, was already sent to Minister St-Pierre, who directs the eXcentris Act, by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises Kulturelles (SODEC).
A few days ago, he had given her a final report.
However, the counter proposal of the cabinet was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time to answer them until 31 December.
In any case, the premises of state donations seem to have been really pushed to the side.
Let us remember that the Quebec ownership community of the cinemas and cinema complexes had rejected a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by presenting the argument that the Cultus Minister had no financial assistance for real estate projects there, which he did not have other cinemas.
However, several other market participants of the segment claimed substantial economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in his cinema complex, which could justify the exception from the state fund for over ten years, with great difficulties, following the self-financed construction of the cinema.
The lack of cinema, which shows independent films, is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his clients at the stange.
The Société Angus as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, taxes on a privately funded campaign, from which they hoped a sum of $70,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The future acquirers are aimed at reopening the three cinema halls on 27 February next year with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des Dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not retrieve the newspaper "Le Devoir" and they ignore what he and his group think of the corrected proposals that they have made down.
Mystery of the complexly shaken Canada elected
The new American diplomatic leads, spread by WikiLeaks, revealed the mystery of what the United Nations under the Canadians' minority complex to the Americans considers, but with the same struggle they revealed the seniority to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voter does not mean the Canadian-American relations, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative Government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more pikant details than the only material content you have to knob into.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period in which the federal election campaign was in full, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participated in the efforts discussed by their political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador set up in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
"A nearly inhabited minority complex to the Canadians may cause the Canadian, political leadership, to talk about everyday internal disputes rather than to send the United States to the black Peter in this election (such as in 1988 at the campaign on free trade)," he describes.
He concludes that the United Nations are thus "the proverbical Goliat of this election: unprecedented, but potentially too threatened to speak of him".
The Ambassador understands this "ore-destructive silence" as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he evaluates, "was it supposed to be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to conduct such an essential relationship, which the chooser has as a key factor in the sense of the urnway."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the communication sent by Terry Breese, businessman in Ottawa on 22 January 2009, which President Barack Obama is to prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the government's survival in the Confidence Council on the Federal Budget at the beginning of February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has been generated by a relief programme of $30 to $40 billion," says Breese.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had to delay Parliament's meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from collapsing the coalition and the retaining of opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed relief programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008, and written by the Ambassador Wilkins, agrees to Washington from the increasingly negative picture that the CBC broadcasts dramatic series from the United States.
The ambassador is worried about sendings such as border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle suggestions can be observed to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also the rides for the purpose of hearings carried out by the CIA's muscular scourge.
Another communication is a detailed report on how Hillary Clinten asked Bernard Kouchner to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo at their first bilateral meeting.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "fall to case" decision.
At the end of the meeting, described, "he delivered a paper to the State Secretary in Puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the document again."
Finally, let's note that the minds are warming up as to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close consultant, had explained over CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "turned".
He referred to Mike Huckabee from the United States here.
Worldwide plan for renewal of lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to reducing greenhouse gas (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly a third of the additional reduction which needs to be realised to stabilise the earth climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the course of the concrete major projects which the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of compulsory reduction obligations of industrial countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKWs given to the earth due to lighting, if the white-colouring bears, which are still representing a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescating or even better, by fluorescing diods (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to a equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the global driving park.
Last year, in Copenhagen, the large exhaust emittents such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, from this balance sheet, 5 gt has to be removed to stabilize climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020, to prevent it from being uncontrolled.
In the white-colouring Birns 95% of energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bears, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED glue bears, this energy needs is reduced by two times again.
The compact fluorescent bears hold between 6000 and 10,000 hours in the cut.
The new LED glue bears, such as those that have placed Philips on the market this week - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a 25,000-hour life expectancy and consume 80% less energy than a white-coloured bear, which gives an indication of the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new glue bears spend very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact lightweight bears have reserves because they contain mercury and that they must be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except that producers provide an assumption agency.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bears, but rather the coal power plants that expose much more mercury to produce the electricity waste from the white-coloured bears.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants discharge 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report presents in detail the profits that each country would gain thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars per year when buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means a equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expects the announcement of the election results
UN General Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "incompetent" publication of the results of the election of the Elfenbean Coast directly after its expiry of time.
"The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for the independent election Commission to receive their work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," said a press speaker of the UN CEO.
"He asks all the parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove their responsibility and to retain any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure of certain foreign governments, the election Commission had left the deadline, which was set on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the expiry of time, the President of the CEI on television confirmed that the Commission would "continue working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have become loud, but the CEI may finally call the name of the winner of the second election round under the Laurent Gbagbo and its opponents Alasane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo-Lager calculates the cancellation of "fair" voting charges in the north by the Constitutional Council, obtained by the former rebellion camp of the Forces Nouvelles (FN) during the failure of the putch in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Head of the Chairmanship campaign of the Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the manoeuvres practiced by the United Nations to intimidate the voters in the north of the country had disappointed the president's followers to go to the election.
The whole election could be cancelled if the complaints submitted by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo Contractors are now more of the view that the highest court of the country is not neutral, since he is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north, who rejects any connection with the ex-rebells, has assessed the delay in proclaiming the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to request the victory.
His alliance parties confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he lost; and commit a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the election Commission has been prevented from publishing the results, it is illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crown of the association and reconciliation process of a country, which had been divided into two parts over years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the politicians of the Ivory Coast that they could be held responsible for them in the event of any expulsions.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first election round on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is 9.3% in the metropolis in the meaning of the International Labour Office (IAA) (including 9.7% in the overseas departments), according to the provisional seasonally adjusted information published on Thursday by the Statistical Federal Office in the Insea.
The unemployment rate in the metropole is 2.631 million.
The data from the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the employable population in the metropolitan and 9.7% in the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In detail, 3.4 million workers of the French metropolis were not busy in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not or whether they were working or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has continued to worsen with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolitan (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% in the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years were unemployed, according to the IAA.
The seniors, on the other hand, have a slightly increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolitan (+0.1 percent points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of over 50-year-old people, 6.6% in the overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years of age could have benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France in total.
After a discussion on its calculation procedures, the Statistical Bundesamt Insee has no longer published the monthly unemployment rates since 2006.
Eurostat, the European Union Statistical Office, continues in this method and announced a 9.8% quota in France for October (including overseas departments) in September on Tuesday.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
A investigation procedure was initiated against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President-in-Office of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), and was delivered into the prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of a investigation procedure on public and fraud-profit markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of undergoing corporate powers, disregarding general goods, healing, co-operating in corruption, unauthorized decoration and arms possession, so his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to express himself on all the questions he will ask for the state prosecutor rather than spread brain-spins."
"It is easy to submit to him a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove it," explained his lawyer Florence Rault of AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (parti socialists) in the department, had appreciated to give the judge a memorial to his justification before his hearing by his lawyers.
A member of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything else than his depony, which he had to lead, to keep running.
With regard to the business field or the destination of the associated fund, Simon said he would never have known.
In this Affaire, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of Aubagne, was also charged on Wednesday for resignation and complication, but then under the obligation to retain itself under judicial supervision by the protagonists of these acts.
"My client was able to give explanations for the facts that were defeated to him."
"The Governing State Attorney has taken into account not to rob him his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more persons were charged and were released from prison on Wednesday in the evening of Tuesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to the Deputy State Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is prosecuted due to "non-authorized influence and passive surveillance".
Two officials of the Aubagne Balling Area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one due to the title "Retroduction and disregard of general good by an official of the public service", the other because of "measurement in disregarding public money".
The lifemate of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of the "healing and submission of corporate assets".
Among the people who were confronted with Guérini, Stéphane Brunengo-Girard was recently imprisoned due to a similar affair of deceitful acts of public hand that had affected Corsica.
The drivers suspected his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X due to suspected fraud in the granting of public contracts, in particular in the disposal sector, is conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous writings in the documents of several open investigation procedures.
The study is based on closely investigative sources, in particular on the conditions of the addition and the operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which relates to waste from the Aubagne region, as well as to certain cities of the Marseille urban entrance area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace overrides its medium function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran because of "Spionage", the French public respired, the diplomacy revolved in alarm and accentuated the worsening of relations between Paris and Teheran.
This is all under the attention of the United States diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, which went to give these advice on dealing with their own crisis of "gifting" in Iran (a small group of migrants).
They show how the French responsibilities tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner held in France, and the American justice due to trade in material for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it believeable to the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Rise in a grim light.
In fact, he had not done anything in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 has the title "Iran: French comments on the way in which to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée adviser in strategic issues, was accompanying Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method.
They urged the Americans to put everything in order to reduce their own nationals who would be violently held in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without neglecting" the words "Ground Human Rights", "Innocent", "fast release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into shame, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this even more, especially the Iranians ask you not to do that."
For "still-sweeps don't solve anything", pass through the discussion attempts on inconsistent ways, the Iranians are "masters in awesome manövern".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "favourable, iranian tactic": "Giselling for the purpose of political oppression".
He announced that the release of Clotilde rice from prison (which would come on August 16, when she fled into the French message) "demands the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230,000 Euro Caution).
And he lets the writeable Elysée anticipate further guilts, a phenomenon that will "sheep it".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde rice has been released from prison 12 days ago, but will continue to be held in Iran.
A information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery requires the United States to be held to Iran because of illegal trade with sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison after a judge in Paris.
Like many other observers, the American message raises questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, who pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France purchased a cow trade ?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
Due to a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4, François Richier assured that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "voluntarily surprised by the decision of the judge", but also tried to reject it.
"It has given a rainy exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under the "strained" supervision of the French Secret Service.
The Elysée advisor chooses a phone number, reopens, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "become currently in the buildings led by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the warranty of Clotilde rice in Iran, Elysée does not have its efforts to believe by writings and the media organized "flight attempts", the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays a "weight" and "influential middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without ironicity and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating 25 August 2009 describes "the media lighting of the French authorities".
What is so much "Thanks" to Mr. Assad, the message of Paris asks.
"Despite their statements full of praise, the French authorities in secret admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document will then deal with the reasons that the Elysée has brought to fail this fiction.
The intensive communications efforts "are aimed at confirming Sarkozy's policy of opening against Syria", he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, "which was seen as premature and undeserved by many critics in France and abroad".
"The Syrian role builds up" Paris attempts to "look on Syria which commendation can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
It is also aimed at sowing "tweight between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from good source.
On August 11, François Richier had trusted her: "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But in spite of everything, we thanked them."
"This should at least confuse Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the Elysée.
In a Communiqué he thanks the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the free movement of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Aschenbrödel", which is forbidden to the young people to play after midnight online games by blocking their access, so declared government responsible.
A draft law to call on online games operators to reject access to these games to young people under 16 years after midnight, will be presented to Parliament in December, painted representatives of Cultus and Family Ministrys.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with learning in school and also with having a normal life throughout the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin explained, with this draft of law conferred by the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The producer companies had a year to prepare for the application of the law, so he precised.
The government also strives to ask the manufacturers to cut down the time limit given daily for access to these games to those youths whose parents ask for it, adding the responsible person.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to make available, allowing the time spent on the Internet to limit.
South Korea is one of the most "net" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also an unattended champion in worldwide online gambling competitions.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games compared to 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appointed the architectural country
In a lighter excitement due to corruption suspicion, the FIFA executive committee appointed on Thursday the architectural countries of the World Championships 2018 and 2022, a highest political choice in which the ranking of influence and lobbying threaten the technical criteria in the background.
One thing, however, is certain: the 2018 edition of the Royal discipline of FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional highburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands Belgium).
The 2022 issue will then be a bit more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) for itself after the première on the African continent in 2010, or to continue to follow its establishment in the United States or in the Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Katar, the Belgian and Dutch Head of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) shows the degree of economic and political use of a world championship.
The makerships behind the scenes are thus threatening to stop until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to create a hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the FIFA Evaluation Report, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documents offer better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the hour of election.
The Sunday Times, who was at the beginning of the release of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could also well have ruined the chances for their own country, the wall of the football, which only once allowed the World Championship to endure, namely in 1966.
The BBC had again given it the nutrient floor on Monday by spreading a documentary report that took three influenced members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to irritate the FIFA and bring the English responsible ones to a lamentation, which had primarily performed an intensive lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The Head of Government hopes for a new edition of the chess train succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 had achieved the organization of the Olympic Games in 2012 for London.
Would this intense effort be sufficient to revaluate the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe, because the Duo Spain-Portugal does not lack drumps with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial sides of the two countries could weaken their ambitions.
The possible repression against the English countries as well as the doubts about Spain's and Portugal's solvency make Russia, which has become a weighty outside despite its gaps in the case (states, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to address the uninjured statement on the visits of the English press "a unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the committee members.
"You're throwing them with shit, you're trying to compromise them," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States appears to be the logical favorites, strengthened by the 1994 experience.
First economic power, seat of the FIFA head sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages to Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very beautiful project separately.
However, these new candidates seem to be premature for two countries that had organized competition in 2002.
Another threat: the WM 2026 granted by FIFA for China, which will drop the Asian chances to 2022.
With Australia and Katar, which had drawn all the registers with the expectation of futurist stages, FIFA pursues its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk, since certainty is.
Australia could, like Japan and South Korea, suffer from the weakness of television rights acquired by the European countries (as a result of time shift), the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: publicity
The Gaulle had really stolen.
Mitterand had let him believe that he was stealing.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the smallest delay.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next.
The current Head of State will be a candidate in 2012.
But openness is not a good face to the side of the mystery, which holds the presidential function.
So you have to do as if the doubt exists.
In the one, as in the other sense.
In 2006, the followers of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without having faith in it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy insisted in serious tone to make his decision "when in the autumn of 2011".
Thus, that on Tuesday evening in Elysée, before the UMP parliamentarys, he would make the perspective of "two mandates", had spread a little fever liability.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
Very missing.
The President just reminded us that the 2008 constitutional change limits the number of five-year term periods to only two.
He made a statement, not a notice.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have only seven and a half years with me, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010, "Don't believe I don't think about the phase after that."
His words of yesterday no longer make him candidate than in the morning, but not less.
If they produce comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidate with the PS on one side.
But it is not the inclusion of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy tries to manifest itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidate in 2012, which reminds many members of the PS more early than adopted for fighting.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the voters of the Rights would prefer a candidate of François Fillon from Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions about it with the UMP", responded immediately and cautiously to the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he was a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has taken up with the openness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of public documents
The last meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council last year should offer an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the order of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy that will come to its conclusion at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European state debt is obliged to have the central bank in Frankfurt no doubt to do it even today to operate more than an excited situation on the European loan markets in order not to cause their aggravation.
Political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister for Finance, Christine Lagarde, welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in the solution to the state budgetary debt of Europe yesterday at a press conference.
She did not dare to say whether she was of the opinion that the central bank could do more, for example by encouraging its programme for the purchase of public loans.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trade partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels, on the occasion of its hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, was not very speaking about its projects, but rather pleased to point out that the programme of purchases of state documents on the secondary market would be "extensive" and that we will "see how the decisions are in the meeting on Thursday".
Only certainty: The ECB will leave its headquarters unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the obligation purchases of the treasury were doubled by the ECB last week to around EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to some traders' discretions, she should have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese public documents yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem's central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
The anticipation of a further follow-up of the purchase price is by no means doubted among traders (see page 29).
The peoples are no longer expecting a remarkable change in the course.
If loans of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be able to create the unlimited funds reserves in a free way, over a period of one week to three months.
The peoples are already concerned today that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
"Otherwise, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in a short way," says Michael Schubert, the Commerzbank's Volkswirt.
"A progressive outturn planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," he anticipates Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of their interventions on the market of State debt, "the ECB was supposed to maintain such a volume of bonds that live in the drew market," adds Norbert Bräms.
In view of the relevance of the European banks' exhibited position on the markets of state debt in the euro area, the central bank has no other choice than to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must stand on the market at any price of the lacking investors and act like this to prevent the premature enthusiasm of the return paid to the weakest states," said a major obligatory owner yesterday.
For if the interest rates were used for high flight, the states would be even more hindered from reducing or just stabilising their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Government of Berlusconi goes into the deck in Italy
After an alarming week for Italy, the situation was a little relaxed yesterday with the decrease in corner interest to 10 years.
A return to deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economics, the Chairman Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "unidentifiable" and heard him expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which the person immediately pointed out.
In any case, on Tuesday, the shaft with the German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basic points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the banking risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain's disparity with the German interest rates is 400 basic points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "severely worried" about the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of infringement from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, it means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting, famine tax revenues that threaten the State to no longer meet its financial needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget for the Senate is estimated by 1.3% or 2%.
Under these conditions, as the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will be 4,3% of GDP in the next year (compared to 3,9% of the governments foretold) and 3,5% in 2012 (in addition to 2,7%).
Therefore, the rest of a new budgetary collective, which could be used at a sum of 7 billion euros after the holidays.
"If necessary, new savings measures must be taken," says economic auditor Olli Rehn.
At the hour, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The basic festivals of Italy's economy are fine and its accounts are regulated, which we have repeated for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, Italian treasurer of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"There are currently no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) demands lower stabilisation progress than other countries", observed Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD CEO.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a request for distrust by the Chamber of Members, as a result of which the preferred elections could be organized by the end of March.
So there is a little favorable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had stressed it in a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think it has been proven on Sunday afternoon and even in the evening: the Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defend their currency and currency."
Although perfectly relative - the discount recorded yesterday in the interest feet of the European state bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, from a start of normalisation, it cannot be spoken yet.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt notice, which is probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, particularly on the banking systems," said the peoples of Exane BBP Paribas.
Especially "the political time is much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of this gap as well as of the danger they are hiding, intensify the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected financial ministers and, in addition, with their counterparts of the G20 are well advanced.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroups and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the plan is the loss of unconventional measures to strengthen the euro area countries in the market thread cross (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, its executive director Klaus Regling has already started its Asia tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the investors in Fernost about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not an explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the Terrain for it.
The first recruitment expenditure from the EU Stability Fund is planned for the next month.
Yesterday, a official American representative of the Reuters Agency had trusted, the United States supported a possible increase in the IWF's additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the first-scale countries, send themselves to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms to be added to savings measures, however, should show effect in a closer future.
Lisbon and Madrid have a different way than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both the one and the other are at every price to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have set up their own budgetary correction and decided on indispensable structural reforms that bring them back their trust in a long term.
The European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to speed up the normalisation process of the markets of public loans.
Axel Weber, who was on passing to Paris on 24 November, first had produced the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, then the Union would not hesitate to take their own pocket again.
The peoples of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of European state debt, judge that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferred" in the form of a direct liquidity syringe.
This appropriation exists: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which is currently 60 billion euros.
A consultant who has all the chances to be carefully examined in the main cities of Europe.

Snow and Glatteis: 24 departements in alarm level Orange
The snow-episodes continue to draw up traffic difficulties, especially in the Bretagne secondary transport networks, and threaten to impair various economic activities.
Thirty-four departments are now in alarm level Orange due to the threatening snow and slateis risk.
The regions of Your, Your-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have reached 20 departments already in the alarm level of Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers tighten the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it cuts easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments snow covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, as well as from 7 to 10 cm, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is considerably enough to cause traffic disabilities and to impair certain economic activities, Météé France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional streets are locked for heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the transportachs Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The transport situation of secondary transport networks in the Bretagne is very difficult, according to the traffic police who refrain from using their own vehicle only in an emergency case, and the use of some TER buses has been deleted throughout the day.
In the Picardie school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
There were no specific restrictive measures for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires the drivers to take the highest care of the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
On Thursday, the Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on the airlines to stretch 25% of their flights from the Paris Roissy Airport and 10% of Orly's flights due to the expected strong snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in the south of London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are locked up to Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport sector in the Ile-de-France is in full, it has rained billions.
At least in the discussions.
This is particularly the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to guide the construction of the SGP, the State has called for a capital dotation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum which the SGP would then allow to give a part of the financial sum on the markets to their doubles.
Today, it has finally come to first bills.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures planned to set up the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on the establishment and the higher taxation of the offices on Ile-de France.
First, as Article 15 of the draft law is removed, "to the benefit of the public-rechtliche institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is summarised: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
Secondly, a new order of existing business taxation is "to modernise it to increase the product resulting from it and to overcome this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring?
A mystery.
This sum is not specified in the text.
From the 4 billion you're far away.
"It is claimed that tax resources are allocated to the EUR 4 billion of the capital dotation, which is put up by the State and that the Société du Grand Paris are gradually carried out for the project", the explaining statement should be found.
The SGP does not find this system to be offended at all.
"Since the moment you have booked revenue (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the projection for over three years and then only create the four billion", it explains.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually withdrawn."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 billion promised one will be able to search for for for a long time, is at risk of creating a very moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Racky hackers and emsive spones
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double significance.
On one side, it has become a obvious scandal, a scandal, which is only a scandal in sense of shineness, which rules the relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, she announces deep changes at international level and gives a presumption on the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act created by a secret service (one x-every nation) consists exclusively of newspaper cuts.
The "exceptional", American disclosures about the sexual habits of Berlusconis are nothing more than what they read over months as well in any x-every journal (except those whose owners are Berlusconi), and the terrifying karicatured profile Gaddafis has already offered Kabarett artists material for their Sketch for a long time.
The rule that the secret dossiers may only consist of already known news is essential to the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to Esotherian publications, you will realize that every work (over the Gral, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Temples or the Rose Crossers) is exactly repeating what has already been written in previous works.
This is not just because the author of occult texts does not want to publish any research (but because he did not know where to find news about the non-existing), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Like the secret acts.
The informant is faul, and faul (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (or otherwise he could be anything, for example editor at Libération), who only considers what he admits.
The Top-Secret information about Berlusconi, who had sent the American message in Rome to the state desert, was the same as those who had published Newsweek the week before.
So why was such a cancellation of the disclosures of these dossiers made?
On one side, these say what each educated person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the Heads of Government can call each other or take a plane to meet at dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have transformed themselves into spy centers, except for some small representation tasks.
Every spectator of investigation films knows this very accurately, and it doesn't happen from hypocrisy that you do so to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is to be repeated publicly injures the task of shine-health and serves to put American diplomacy into a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-every hacker can pick up the most secrets of the most powerful country of the world is the great battle against the Prestige of the State descendant.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "sharpends" in need.
But we are devoting ourselves to the depthful nature of what has happened.
Previously, in Orwell's times, all power could be bundled like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has since been perfectly correct, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction, the hotel visited, the selected motorway, and so on; the citizen would be the total victim of the eye of power.
However, if one is aware of what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control procedure stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but at least every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the revenge of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to preserve their own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel already said that a real mystery is an empty mystery (and an empty mystery can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkels is essentially a mystery free of secretis, as it brings the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did not do Sarkozy or Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this violation, which has been added to such a mighty force?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will not put any prescribed information online - that would be like a hang on the street corners.
But it is also obvious that with the current technologies it is in vain to hope to keep confidential reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than to figure out whether and when a Head of State has moved on in a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and certain ear relationships be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see myself need to imagine the government's reporters, in a secret way embarrassing on uncontrollable march routes, not carrying their messages anywhere other than in just memory, and also hiding the few written information they have received in the castle.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed sheets: in general, the spionage attempt of Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is moving forward today like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionated communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegrapher with (phonical) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for tapes, by splashing backwards and opening all the mysteries of the assembly, while the (numerical) CDs today can only jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
With the high speed trains, you will drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours per plane including the surrounding.
It is therefore not unusual that politics and communication technology come back to car and horse.
A last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were smuggled between the messages.
It is now the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France beautifully speaks its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the rapidly resolved financing promises (also known as ‘Fast Start’ or ‘Fast Start’ funding’), which have been realized by the developing countries.
And already the rough French cows have been discovered.
The Copenhagen Treaty obliges developing countries to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million a year).
At the time of opening the COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed procedure report of its Member States, press conference, large side events, brochure distribution.
The operation is remarkable and appreciated for its real value: the developing countries and civil society are happy to see if all developed countries did the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that in 2010 it has released EUR 2.2 billion, which brings it on the right way to calculate its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
In accordance with the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort has been made without sufficient to the disadvantage of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the correct value he thinks best.
For example, the EU Commission has evaluated itself as a target value for those in 2009: international funding will be maintained and will provide 150 million for over three years in the framework of the financing of fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar guidelines, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
On the contrary, France believed that the financing of all new projects in 2010 was "new and additional".
Otherwise, there are no target values in the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In particular, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or also decrease) - France implies compliance with its commitment in terms of "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses his accounting mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 borrowed € equivalent to 1 donated €.
Apparently, this is only difficult to respect: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission reduction projects based on the most efficient technology) can be justified, it is deceived to present the euro which is equivalent to a given euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the investor country should be counted as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following considerations: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by taking up € 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and spending €8.5 million) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country of the EU that largely uses loans.
Germany calls for 46% while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including Slovakia) fulfil their commitments to 100% donations.
Otherwise, if the majority of the European Union spends 1€ to fulfil its obligations, France is just 10 cents and understands a similar effort.
Beautiful Hokuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: partly with a further development of the action over time and, secondly, with the reality of financial effort.
France is able to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promise and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (which it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the work) could have a double negative effect; once the EU internally (which does the other Member States continue with the donation, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not let completely deceive...
The chapter of early financing is only a small question at a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the huge machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever, it is essential to learn its lessons from the first year of financing.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its type of booking for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its commitments and compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward discussions on the issue of long-term financing (a different, crucial and currently discussed topic): the question of "comparability" or the type of booking of its loans does not arise.
France could change its position in order to be as advanced as in the case of disputes as in other matters.
So hope is based on the new Minister for the Environment, Kosciusko-Morizet, which will meet in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement on the fast start of France and its vision of the "comparability" and the use of loans would naturally increase from the international basis of trust, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes various chemicals over the day 81, thus a study published this Wednesday by the Générations Futures Association (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that their results "due to the low number of analysed samples, do not represent a statistically significant value, but represent an illustration character of the treated problem", had usually bought foods used in four of July and September, from about ten years of age to meals plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - have been examined as well as nastry from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is lower: 81 chemicals, including 42 as possible or likely to be crebs-induced and five classified as safely carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrinine-induced factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"When the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded in the nearby total of cases, this survey is very well taken out that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancer-induced substances or substances with endocrinine disorder factor is anxious," says the association.
Already during breakfast only the butter and the tea with milk already contains more than ten of the possibly crebsing residues and three safely proven as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil as an intermediate meal for the study shows traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including in the lunch, where the study has detected traces of a strictly prohibited in the EU insecticide.
In addition, the hacksteak, the tuna fish from the pants, even the baguette and the cheese rubber of pesticides and other chemicals were spit.
In the water management, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 detected chemical residues was on the "richest" and even the plastic counters used for heating the meal in the microwave were not unloaded.
The final risk of this "emission cocktail" for consumers is "probably underevaluated," said the study.
On the other hand, the Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the increase in civilisation diseases.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
