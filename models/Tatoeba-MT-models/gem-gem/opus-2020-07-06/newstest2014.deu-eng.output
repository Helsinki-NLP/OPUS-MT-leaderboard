Goodach: More safety for walkers
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday the new B 33 footprint at the village parking area has been operated in Gutach - in the views of the older town house temple.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or significance?
This question was clearly answered by Mr Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The Rathausampel was installed at that time because it secures the school path," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel secures bicycle drivers as well as bus passengers and the Mountainle residents.
The installation officially operated yesterday was important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub›.
"In the high traffic and pedestrian upcomings, for their safety a further amplifier had to be made," said Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold by the Offenburg County Council.
"Availing current measurements at the B 33 every day are about 12,000 vehicles the municipality Gutach, of which about ten percent are heavy load traffic," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another ankle is more than necessary: "Security is simply happening here," said Arnold.
A total of four traffic views have been carried out, and a circular traffic was also considered, but rejected because of the engage in the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, everything was tested in the location selection of the ampelmasts before: "In the middle of an extra for us with particularly long wooden stamps of loaded transporters, we have tested whether these vehicles can ride from the Sulzbach Road to the B 33 without knocking the ampmasts".
Around EUR 15,000 is the "modernest thing that is currently on the market," explained Arnold.
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs that light so strong that the lights can be well detected by the drivers, for example, in the depth of the sun.
And it is also sparable: The older light plants consume about 100 watts, the new eight watts.
There are three light systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the ankle button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position.
If the road is free, it comes straight green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the footganger.
"If a group or disabled people go through the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone will come safely over the road," explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver had to think here as a partner and watch the road.
This wasn't the case yesterday: The chamber for footgangers showed green, shattered a upper class vehicle through - with bright red.
Joseph Winkler has written for more than 30 years the necessities of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the hanging of rough violence and stupid sexuality, the nakedness and unity - have often described the corntner poet.
The Büchner Priisträger is known mainly as a prosa author, theatre texts are rar in his work.
Collage from Prosatext Gerhard Fresacher presents a collage of prosatexts for his performance "Weatherlights on the tongue tip", which is now seen in the garage X on the Petersplatz.
The theater maker, for example, combines elements from the autobiographical Roman "The Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, his family relaunching" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important requisite: a circular sofa, on which the expression is copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
Regisseur Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance exceeds the template with a plenty of regiments, known from the repository of post-dramatic game forms.
Especially the actors come to the somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard with the head under water, with their evening ropes at the wall.
They are forced into cellophan or leather, stuck on dangerously high boots through the insensation, either monologize them loudly or lie completely dipped on the floor of the stage.
However, the text is hardly communicated in this endeavored way.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the bandwidth is enough from Deep Purple to a popular songgut.
Only at the end is the overwritten performance somewhat to rest, and Winkler's nasty absurd humor blows up.
A blackbox in the car?
US-American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that is located in the armatur board of each car.
The devices that record each driven kilometre and report the information to the authorities are the main point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the obsolete system for financing US-American roads.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly facilitated an intensive debate with colorful allians.
Liberaries have joined environmental groups and are proposing that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometres, and perhaps where they were travelled, and then use the information to calculate tax modes.
The Tea Party is disguised.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while you cannot agree on a procedure at the convention, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently checking how they can switch to a system for the next ten years, paying the driver per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers of which some are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It is nothing that we may only use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the mile driven in all California car drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for this is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes paid by the US Americans to the pillar, is pleasing.
But in America no more is done as much as before.
Cars use less fuel.
State oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocent per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don't dare at high prizes to raise the tax only to raise a cent.
"The fuel tax is simply not future", says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with ride writers to test a mile-based payment system.
“This represents the most meaningful alternative for the long term,” he said.
Office charts describe it as miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea can be found in cities of liberalism, because taxes could, for example, be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that steam and climate harmful gases are reduced.
The Californian planners set up the system for the development of strategies to achieve the ambiguous, legally established objectives of the state of climate change.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also explained that he sees the most common long-term alternative in it.
The free traders of the Reason Foundation are also committed to the idea of allowing drivers to pay on the route.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President for Directives at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers, who in a 2011 report called on the Congress to move towards millennial accounting.
The US Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project last year, which would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority of the representative house prevented the support and responded to the concerns of Members of rural areas representing people who often have to lay many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life.
However, several state states and large cities move on their own in this direction.
The most committed is Oregon, who currently acquires 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles to the state instead of the mineral oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois tests it in limited degrees with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, of which the Ministry of Transport of 17 States belongs to the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment, car drivers were skeptical in thinking that the government could follow each of their movements.
“Remember against Big Brother and such things was a major problem”, explains Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Success Management at the Ministry of Transport of Nevada.
People didn't want it.
When the test arrived, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the drivers into grown surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, locked technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to record data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of states, which now look out for affordable technology, with which the state can see the travelled miles, but not exactly when and where.
So, Khan said, the public would be more calm.
The hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company has not initially arrived to help states in taxing drivers.
Rather, it was her goal to take foot in a prosperous market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay on the basis of the mile driven.
But the devices tested by her are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
“The people are rather willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,” explained Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive possibilities to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting to give drivers a number of choices.
You can choose for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any device and instead pay a fixed fee on the basis of the average mile driven by all inhabitants of the state.
Other places hope to be able to sell the concept of a mistrust public by allowing the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that also pays for parking fees, a insurance must be paid only for travelled kilometres and speed data are collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can vary Staus.
“Motors would be motivated by the added value of the advantages that the system offers to participate,” says a city planning document.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the area of San Francisco Bay, officials declared that the Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-time fee or annual fee may be charged to drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that are low-benzine-consuming, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient,” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Kingsfeld: Small team hits awaker
The volunteer fire warrior managed her autumn main test despite the lack of staff with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feder in the Burgberger Street in his exercise assumption.
There should have been a short closure when sawing.
Two people were injured by the fire and the smoke development, but one of them could send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respirators of the war were prepared to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead to the free.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy because a narrow step was to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stalling for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also strawballs in it.
There were also electrical machines for wood processing.
The first relief attack took place over the tank in the vehicle.
Another direction was carried out over a flood hydrant in about 100 meters away.
Now three ransom attacks could be created.
A hole beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also showed what to achieve with little personnel in the exercise.
In serious cases, a support is made through the day-to-day convenience group of the Kingsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the outcome of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
At his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwwarzzwald, Landtagspräsident Guido Wolf was also able to inform in Titisee-Neustadt about where the working forces came from tomorrow.
At the High-Schwarzwald Support Centre, he followed this important question together with the executive school leaders, as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the parental board chairman.
"Education is an important location factor," stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Center Hochschwartz.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Funding Centre, the Kreisgymnasium and the School Centre.
He also praised family kindness in the district.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in view, but because of the demographic change, it is also the phase to care for family care," explained Wolf.
In addition, he suggested that more and more employees cared for the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the stress resulting from the workforce can lead to an end to the employment relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For who has already learned the advantages of the region during his study, with its acquired knowledge and capabilities, often receives the regional economy, which contributes to strengthening the region," proved the Landtag President.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the professional needs could be covered.
It believes that the site advantage of the district is its beneficial location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, he experienced the efforts already undertaken for the development of public passenger transport on his train from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Keep fast and make sure public transport improves," he explained to the address of the local politicians present.
A entertaining afternoon experienced with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has invited Dietinger Seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
Earlier, the elderly citizens were hosted in the restaurant.
This afternoon is now held in St. Josef's nursing home.
The inhabitants looked forward to the delicious cakes and tortures.
Later there was worst salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich interviewed common melodies.
The more than 100 years old natural stone walls as a preliminary delimiting of the old school court standing before renovation to the Kirchstraße are to be re-established on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bruunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angle wall was built in the first work of the renovation of the front school court, for the stabilization and static discharge of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further approach provides for Alexander Misok from the Bruunlinger City Building Office to include the Landdenkmalamt in the plannings and create a renovation concept for the old wall.
Thereafter, a cost calculation will be made by experts, which will then be put on the table to the Council for the decision and determination of further action.
A decision on this will probably fall in the next year.
After the renovation, planting and planting of the old school court within the two sidewings of the school built in 1912, in time must be taken as a follow-up measure, the renovation-required limitation walls must be renovated and reconstructed.
The historic, a hundred years old delimiter wall of the old school court to the Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damages, as there is no drainage, refining needs and has a curtaining to the front.
Deep rices in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is currently not threatened.
A stable wall is the condition for one of students using a school court, which has been done through the current fastening work.
Originally, even in the years 2008/2009 the school court was planned, but high unplanned expenditure led to a shift.
An important word in the historical school walls, which has even been used for films, will be spoken by the National Memorial Office.
If standards come from this page, then the city of Bruunlingen hopes for subsidies from the monument protectors.
The students of the Bruunlinger Grundschule, who are now again taught in a well-renovated old school building with new aula, can soon use the old school court.
Özdemir wants to receive Jazzaus education in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now joined.
"I think it is wrong to give up the wholesale education at Stuttgart's University of Music," said Özdemir to the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classics are located at the Jazz standsort Stuttgart together.
This contradicts Özdemir, who is considered as a favourite for a direct mandate at the Federal Day election on 22 September, the Green-Rote Government.
On the basis of a expert study, this is a new order of five music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
In addition, the course of Jazz and Pop will be transferred from Stuttgart’s Music High School to Mannheim.
US-Grenze: "Super-tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, mediators have discovered and suspended a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the US Customs Authorities announced, the more than 500 metres long tubes between Tijuana and San Diego were equipped with electricity, rail and a ventilation system.
Thus, three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig through under the radar," said the General State Attorney of the US District of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where this was discovered at the end of the tunnel.
To the drug bands, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the exciting equipment of the tunnel, the mediators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took advantage of about a year.
The rail system was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building that is 80 meters away from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters of height and 90 centimeters of width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine found.
The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the convicted marijuanas.
All three are threatening as the highest penalty of lifelong liberty, as officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnel.
Bill Sherman said that the "discussion" of the drug bands, whose traditional routes were cut off, was said from the DEA drug capture in San Diego.
They would do everything to get to the United States.
No details were announced to the arrested, at least one was Mexican, said it.
You have to expect prison sentences up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger Festival Year
The anniversary of the city Geisingen at the 1250.
The return of the first incomprehensible mention is getting ever closer.
When the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary is on.
Geisings and church houses were first mentioned in writing together.
In churches a document was made in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15, there is an official date for the anniversary, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this event will take place in the place where both were mentioned for the first time 1250 years ago, in church houses.
In the context of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be 1250 in July on a weekend from 18 to 20 July.
We'll celebrate again.
On Friday with a festival, Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
The church-house festival is also on this festival.
City music director Rudolf Barth wrote a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed at three dates.
On 21 June, together with the sunshine celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and invited in the anniversary, the official date is on the last September week, on 27 and 28 September.
During the Geisinger City Jubilee, a new chronicle is also produced.
"It is supposed to be a chronic not only from Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the geising of today, which consists of geisings, church houses, lipperdings, aulfingen and goodmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengster.
And also the Geising of today celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974, the present space was carried out with the communities.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November at the new festival hall in Geisingen.
In 2014, however, it is another year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki starts on February 8, with a usage night at its 60-year-old existence, the harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years old and has the festival banket on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Oldenwerk Leipferdingen becomes 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10, the music club Polyhymnia Leipferdingen becomes 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the burning festival from July 4 to 7th.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a grant certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which were then courtyards.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
For 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly, the municipal reform is also 40 years behind.
Council takes the glazing plants into view
Should the railway passage "Am Hirschen" be rebuilt in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schitach must take 220 000 euros in hand for this purpose.
The German railway will improve the Kinzigtal track in the next year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety of rail transfers - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the communities agree with the reconstruction measures, they must participate with a third in the costs, the rest of the train and the covenant.
Schiltach's city building master Roland Grießhaber explained to the Council the specialities of the train transition "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build a booking at the height of the tunnelmund in the west of the railroad.
There may also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, on counter traffic without having to block the glides.
Consequently, grey owners proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could spread the next road at a given time in order to ensure a smooth flow of transport.
This was controversially discussed in the municipal council, as some councils doubted the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp put the mood of critics on the point: "Do we have to take so much money in hand because of so few vehicles?"
Citizen Thomas Haas contradicted: The "Hirschen" train transition was used regularly for longwood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is transported partly through this route because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not travel to the main road there.
In addition, the route served as a redirect for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, Haas argued.
As it is clear that Kirchberg and Castle Mountain Tunnel must be rebuilt and renovated, as this is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway transition "Am "Hirschen" can also have an important transport significance for a longer period.
The councils agreed to examine the costs of the presumed distribution of the road.
In spite of this, the construction of the railway transition was generally agreed with the measure that the necessary support walls were built so that the city could, if necessary, expand the next road towards "Bahnhofstraße" for meeting traffic to about 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the reconstruction of the rail transition at Gerberei Trautwein could draw up a very different problem that concerns access to the strongly rising "gerolt houses road".
The management had been able to investigate the transformation plans of the train from Breinlinger's engineering office, since it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Weg would be possible yet.
The investigation concluded that it would not be excluded that the trends in the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting up.
The responsibility for this is, again, the city as a roadwearer.
Consequently, the reconstruction could lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wooden output and the degradation worked in the current expansion state, it was not supposed to agree to the conversion of the railway transition, Haas argued.
The risk of collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition should also be significantly lower in this place than on the other railway crossings, because directly at the centre of the stop, where there is a good vision connection.
Even trains from the main railway station must have been broke down at this point, so that no collision is threatening.
Mostly the reconstruction of this railway transition was refused, as the city of Schiltach had to "bade out" the problem with seating vehicles, said the Council, as the train could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction work was completed.
As unproblematic, the body considers the rebuilts at the "From Heubach" and "From Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements have already been concluded with the train.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravity waves or black holes - European Space Agency experts now have to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years.
30 proposals were made for selection, five are still in the race.
Far from the world.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are at least some of these lives, nobody knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you look for gravity waves?
Or would you like to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or have earthlike planets discovered and thereby discovered alien life?
These questions are just the responsibility of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make research more important.
The etate for such "L missions" is about one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were debated, five of them have now come to the closer elections.
Many bodies consider the proposals, hacking in the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision should be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions has been selected by the Esa to find answers to the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme in 2007 initiated.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The precise operations of the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the creation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the proverbical darkness.
A huge infrarotle scope in all could pass through this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to examine this question, the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched in 2017, with the 500 already known planetary systems in our closer environment.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could depict earthlike planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indice for biological activity.
How does the sun system work?
Finally, this question will also provide information on the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as its particle radiation with the planetal system.
In our solar system, these operations can be examined exemplaryly.
With the Solar Orbiter, the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (this budget is about a half billion euros) for this question.
The sun will start in 2017 and watch the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out the role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system.
For this, the Esa provides the first of the total three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" programme.
The Sonde "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start their journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and will examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the iron moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The world room offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and so to examine whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also variations that could show physicists the way to a new theory, under which all known natural laws can be united.
How has the universe originated and what does it consist of?
Our cosmos came through the Urknall 13.7 billion years ago.
Besides our common matter, from the stars, planets and living creatures like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity Galaxies and Galaxies are united, and dark energy, which accelerates the expansion of the world’s universe.
Until now, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first second break of the Urknall, nor what Dark Materie and Dark Energy exists.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved a M mission, whose start is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the sun will first examine the distribution of the matter in the universe in the entire sky and thus make it possible to reconcile the design of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race?
Of the 30 proposals will remain only two remaining at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chances for an authorisation as a L-Mission, according to many experts, have "E-Lisa", a demanding concept to demonstrate gravity waves.
Among these, physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had foretold almost 100 years ago.
They weren't proven until today.
Elisa could do this, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides a detector of two or three seconds, which is stationed in all.
In contrast to plants on earth, he could also prove gravity waves that were produced at the Urknall and thus provide new knowledge of the origin of the cosmos.
Four more suggestions are still competing for the second L mission: a large röntgentelescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate earthlike planets.
There are already excreted proposals for the sample-back transport from Mars, for the research of moon, Venus and asteroids, as well as for sun physics.
Snowden will be ready to ‘cooperate’ with Germany as regards US surveillance
Edward Snowden, Whistleblower of the US-American Secret Service, explained that he was willing to travel to Berlin and proclaim before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not give answers to their activities.
The German member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum was received to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he wrote: “Although the result of my efforts proved positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a departure of loyalty and attempts to criminalise political opinion with criminal threats where no defense is possible.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charge charged by the US Ministry of Justice includes spionage and theft of state ownership.
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online: “If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to enable it.”
The relations between the United States and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has heard the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Mr Oppermann, Member of the Secretary Committee, said that it should be possible to listen to Snowden as a witness if this is possible to “threate him without threat and completely destroy relations with the United States”.
Strobele, a member of the Greens, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA co-worker Snowden, he could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden said in Germany, he would need a assurance that he was there "safe", said the Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was experiencing a "excessive and continuing" persecution campaign that had displaced him from his home.
However, it is touched by the global response to “my political opinion” action.
People around the world, as well as high-level politicians – also in the United States – have described the disclosures about an uncontrolled system of surveillance as a merit to the general.
In his letter, Snowden makes a offer to the German authorities of cooperation, “if the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been solved”.
Frontier Airlines charges for handbags
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to hide handbag on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of handbags and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade, even if in the announcement on Wednesday it was possible for passengers to keep the whole dosage.
The new fee applies to handbags in the bag over the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that 25 US dollars were calculated when the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars in travellers who paid only at the airport hill.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the fee of 100 US dollars aims to move travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate this sum," she explained.
In 2008, airlines began to require fees for the first and second baggage set up.
Passengers who tried to kill them have therefore stopped as much as possible in the handbag, resulting in that the bags are often overfilled over the seat.
Fees are one way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money.
It's about the most faithful customers of frontiers who had clearly expressed that it would be more and more difficult to find space in the field above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the frontier hill may be allowed to take a baggage for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a similar baggage.
O'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the flight hill.
The new handbag fee of frontier enters into force only in summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers are often insulting by baggage and other charges, but airlines are happy to take back.
They argue that the transport of the bag should cost money and pay passengers this service if they wanted it.
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of flights after years of loss.
However, most people have left the fingers of charges for handbags.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first charges for handbags and later Allegiant Air, also a cheap flyer.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully observes the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the baggage fee of Spirit brings 50 million dollars each year.
Sorensen, who had previously a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently been flying with spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the hill if passengers were faced with the unusual handbag fee of the company.
“The boarding process belonged to the most smooth I experienced in my career in the airline,” he said.
I expected to see teeth knocks and handwritten discussions on the hill.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding ran as tasted.”
Frontier follows Spirit also at the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, limonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice should keep the whole dosage and be filled with coffee for free.
Water is still free.
U.S. Airways had recently tried to demand money for refreshment drinks in 2008, however, seven months later, after the passengers had complained and no other large company had been withdrawn.
Frontiers Step to raise charges for the handbag if passengers do not buy directly at the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to their direct purchase instead of via an online travel office.
However, frontiers have gone most widely in this area.
In September, the company began to forgive only half as many violent miles when booking over an online travel office.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route.
A flight booked on a third party with frontier over 1,000 miles, therefore customers will spend only 250 miles more.
Passengers can also be reserved only when buying directly on the website of Frontier Places.
Frontier has a faithful customer tribe at its seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The remuneration decreased by 9 per cent and the airline capacity shrinked almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, as is to be read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the mother company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to handle the finances of frontiers in the context of the sale of the company.
Proverbs From the Bible
Over 40 women visited the last woman’s fruitage this year in the evangelical church congregation of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipal house was "speaking from the Bible" and "speaking from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, chairman of the Church Council, entered the Biblical proverbs after breakfast.
"Speakwords contain vitalities, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several words with the corresponding scriptures and explained the meaning.
They called words such as: "Be watchful of wood, as shoes fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone who is his Lord in sleep, wash his hands in innocent.
Many times, the speaker also advised her listeners about what it was about.
The Middle Ages talks took up the church council christel Dehner: All good things are three, make blue, hook something.
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches which she called "bridges in the past".
To the end, a Tombola was released.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the guests of the breakfast round, the mayor Roman Waizenegger also communicated.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unnecessary people in tourism
At the Mecklenburg Sea Plate, a pilot project for the tourism industry was launched.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unnecessary in the industry are to be qualified for three winters to professionals for hotels and restaurants.
"New is that the six-month courses end with finals," said Carmen Wiechert of the Labour Agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefit is widespread: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would be able to receive trained professionals who were increasingly missing in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the industrial and commercial chamber in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that a "internal error" and not a hacker is guilty of the crash of the website
The treasureful National Security Agency explained on late Friday that an error has slaughtered its public website for several hours and not hacker, as was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update”, explained the Spionage Agency in an e-mail report.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the outcome was caused by a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers have noticed that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and that is still not available for some users.
Previously, a speaker of the NSA had explained to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was "none in any way".
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least a group of hactivists used for themselves to laugh the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target site is overflowed with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site breaks together.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not aim to induce into the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, whose nickname once was No Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the light of the public and sees its widespread surveillance programme in the country and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA co-worker Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service procured initial speculations about the fact that the incident today was the result of a targeted Cyper Operation.
The number of people without job in October is slightly reduced by 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota was 3.1 per cent better than last year and also better than September, "we had hoped more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, Vice-President of the Office for Work in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have so far responded to settings.
One reason for this is, according to Felder-Bauer, "We have hardly professionals in crafts, healthcare and old care".
Yearly conditions have also been recruited since September for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry.
In the mid-December the winter season begins there.

Profit remuneration for bombardier after falling in delivery numbers and contracts
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decrease in net profit after being under pressure by decreasing orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter as well as contract problems in the railway spare.
Bombardier with a seat in Montreal also published no flight test data for his brand-new plane of the CSeries and provided no new information on whether the plane could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September.
At the young flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago, only three further starts have been followed, which may appear to be questioned whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a course crash of more than eight percent at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, Cameron Doerksen, Analyst at National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment of "outperform" to "sector perform" in order to ensure that the share has a limited course potential in the next one to two quarters.
“Zwar was expected to have weakened delivery numbers in aircraft mostly, but we are clearly disappointed from the development of the borders in the transport sector,” said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program for the plane progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries plane series can catapulate the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and floated for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company's claims on fuel efficiency and the cost saving potential of the new airlines are applicable.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Vice-President Pierre Beaudoin is confident that bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 mandatory orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, the management of the company also insured analysts and media that the programme was in the deadline.
“The test aircraft has no longer remained on the ground than expected,” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that during the standing time of the plane, ground tests and software updates have been performed.
Each manufacturer plants differently.
We decided to make a first flight and then attach a revision period, whatever we have done.
This happens during the entire flight programme.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, said the company's side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical if 12 months after the first customer can take a plane of the CSeries.
Bombardier explained that it reviewed the planning for the operation (EIS) and will update it in the next months.
“The slow advance of the flight test – although they obviously correspond to internal planning of bombardiers – strengthens our view that the operation is moving to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, bombardiers fell net profits of $147 million or $8 cent per share of $172 million or $9 cent per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents.
The sales decreased slightly and decreased from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer worldwide indicates that he delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 in the last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The volume of order in the air and space spare amounted to $32.9 billion on September 30th and was unchanged compared to December 31th.
“In the area of air and space, the results were within our standards, but the low order entrance and the overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
The sales in the air and space spare fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that the sales in this spare have risen by nearly eleven percent to $1.2 billion.
The order in the transport spare amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September and thus slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by dismantling problems in some large contracts.
According to company management, there will be new standards for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the bombardier action was 8.5 per cent and was 4.83 Canadian dollars after announced that the Google Financial Board of Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.
The Brazilian embras SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardiers in the world, reported a ten percent decrease in the quarterly profit on Thursday.
United States: Shooting at Los Angeles Airport

Until landing had been temporarily stopped, said it.
However, on CNN several flights were also observed at the start.
Terminal 3 is used mainly by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer, who warned drug boss from police investigation, must be in prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information on underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence could come to light.
He was sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known criminal who warned a drug baron from a great police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed was sentenced to three years of prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensible information about investigations about its activities in the drug trade after he had been compromised by his own cocoa insult.
Criminalists' prosecutor with the nickname "Bash" was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a former drug procedure.
Officers observed that Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of Kokain at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal of the lawyer's chamber.
The investigations showed that Ditta regularly consumed drugs of Class A after traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards during tests.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men in charge of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the context of a large investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were arrested later after the police guaranteed heroin and cocaine in a number of house searches of 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could be public.
Today, Ditta, who is working for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and condemned at the Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week trial in two cases because of the disability of justice.
He admitted the cocaine possession during a previous survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage tone.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium in Ewood Park at the dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
The court announced that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests of Class A drugs had been discovered in his hair, his wallet and on its credit cards.
Thista was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the suspicious dealer because he was his client, and claimed that her discussion was under the "advocate secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
At police hearing, he stated that he operated both under his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
The court announced that he had called on important actors of drug trafficking, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed about what the mediators knew about them.
State lawyer Anne Whyte said: “A criminal prosecutor should know better than everyone else that you do not break the law.”
Thista is accused of the abuse of his position as a criminal defender, since he has acquired too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who cares for his lawyer with drugs.
A part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these people.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He acted as far as possible against police investigations so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta brought his professional profession into prosecution.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Thista showed every mistake of himself and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass information on to Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire: “Her Ditta has taken the step from a criminal to a criminal at the moment when he began to purchase drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine independence led to a hopeless compromise and made it receptive to the motives of leaders of organised crime, who commanded him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide confidence and confidence in the public.
Ditta has lost this confidence and attempted to shake behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organed Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a sentence in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and legal disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment after he declared himself guilty of the conspiracy of heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Five and thirty others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug abuse.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, in which he indicated that his dream job was to represent as a lawyer Mandants in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and chance inequality is the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
To complete the celebrations of his 160-year-old existence, the song crown Dunningen will cover two services with the "German Fair" of Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the Musical "Rock my Life", which was enthusiastic in the spring of this year, the song crance will enrich two religious services with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard at the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 a.m. in the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German fair with the original title "Songs for the celebration of the sacred sacrifice of the fair", D 872, is a spiritual musical work of composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of origin.
The fair is listed in the framework of the religious services, as the commander Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the bladder group of the music club Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepsis weighs spectacular confidence
For example, the elections to the Pfarrgemeinderat 2015 will change fundamentally in Haslach’s Selfcare Unit.
There is then only one common parish for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies of Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For the basic decisions of diocese are no longer to change and it is to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepsis toward the New is softly weak as to see a trust.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on future composition and the size of the parish community, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the Selfcare Team were sufficient.
On the basis of a presentation, the regional dekan Georg Schmitt explained the new directives for seal care units in the Archdiocese Freiburg.
Then, as a church community, the SE Haslach will form a body of public law that will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual churches.
There will only be a joint parish and a foundation council in which the priest's power is represented.
From each parish, at least two elected members shall be represented in which six parishes are formed locally called municipal teams.
Their task will be to promote the church life in the place in the future.
In the question of the finances of the individual parish community, there was a significant need for discussion.
The innovations ensure that collected funds remain in the pairs.
On the other hand, the liabilities are transferred to the general community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then meets all pastries, there were great concerns.
"Also in the past, only projects were invested that could be managed by each parish alone," has Haslach's Pfarrgemeinderats Chairman Bruno Prinzbach relatively.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes painted Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the Supply Unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they had taken the task of "becoming one, staying five" and had to find that this is not so easy at all.
The bodies of the Haslacher Selfcare Unit then sought to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish community as well as the practical work of the communal teams.
The preparations will be concrete at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the next spring.
At the end, the Pfarrgemeinde Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the seal care unit, which was agreed with a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
Pfullendorf's citizens need to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the manager of the urban works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, a four-headed Pfullendorfer family of 70 to 90 Euros More costs per year.
The main reason for the rise in prices is the increase in the so-called EEC environment from 5.277 to 6.3 cent per kilowatt hour.
This salary is refined every year by the four operators of the large electricity trays in October.
These amounts to the additional costs of their energy turning, which they can raise through a surcharge above the electricity price.
The city works of Pfullendorf form the last part of this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of Energy Company had even considered a higher surveillance, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete payments have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We are going from an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, with the number will be more close to the 2 cents.
Ampel on permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes an ankle just doesn't become green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What do you want to do, then drive with red?
If a person has waited long enough on a red ankle and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart's lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "adjusted", which could be differently explained from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before a functional disorder of the amp is to be dealt with.
However, whoever continues to drive despite red lights must be aware that he is responsible for an accident caused by it.
If you are tolerating less than five minutes, you may not wait long enough, you will warn Becker and refer to a decision by the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes, a driver had ignored the amp and had to be responsible for a negligible breach of red light.
Because the ankle was not defective, but jumped a little later on on green.
A driving ban was saved to him because of the special situation - but not the penalty.
The Council of the Regions welcomes a solid budget
Whenever it comes to municipal meetings about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has been laughing well.
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debts are no longer known to the administration since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be recorded as full success in this sense.
This was evident in the presentation of the financial statement for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros would have exceeded one million euros than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach.
In particular, the excess should be higher commercial tax revenues and the share of the municipality in income tax.
The assets budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Rather than the EUR 1.5 million planned, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially the higher transfer from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
Since less investment has been made in the financial year 2012 than planned, reimbursement has also been higher.
Overall, the overall reimbursement could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like this," Gerster praised with a view to the annual account.
He and the municipal councils were delighted with the good figures.
It may sound paradox, but precisely these good figures could be expensive for citizens soon.
Due to the good financial situation, the community in the past could quit high elevations.
However, according to Gerster, subsidies have been reduced by the country more often.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensatory measures.
Among other things, the cities and communities applying for subsidies must provide certain elevations.
"The issue of lifts must be examined, as investments that we would like to have subsidies in the coming years are at stake," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years of singing, Hubert Wermter's history is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colors of his men's singing club on the stage.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir that has probably won more than loved.
In the association, Wermter was also active, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his commitment and his consent, he received a number of awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Representative on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, transferred him - as the chor is also a church chor - a document of the Association and one of the honor letters signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince.
His singer's colleagues handed him the document of the German Chorverband and a gravated tennteller.
In addition to the honor, the 31th autumn festival went into common trains: With the MGV Betra, the song cranz Salzstetten, the singer department of Baisingen and the local music club, the fullmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different chors and song styles, which the about 400 visitors had.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with voiceful songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Lustig, your brothers".
Their honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared them to honor a little steam - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singer Betra also sang classic choir songs like "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Vert, weit weg" from Hubert Goisern, as well as the folk song "You went through the valley".
With its mixed choir and his female group - the "impulschor" - the song crowned saltstettes for the women's percentage of the festival.
The mixed choir kidnapped with the neapolitan genus "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulsor" also reversed to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sports Association came back with "What is the Sob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" in the home, where the full-maring music club offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer conducted a Kasperl theatre and read a few stories that the children were busy over the lunch.
Children’s dreams are true
The children's gardens and children's days in the customs circle get posted in these days.
The Black Forest Bote in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Zollernalb Sparkasse would like to support the facilities in the implementation of their construction and refinement wishes.
Does the children's garden need a new sandbox?
All children's gardens, children's days, and children's crops from the whole customs circle can participate in the action.
If you have a desire to build or refine your setup, you can apply to the boat at the Black Forest.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Kindergarten-Baustelle.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus und Sparkasse Zollernalb, chooses three wishes from all ends.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be to be realized with construction materials at a maximum of EUR 2000 and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner itself has to provide for many hardworkers.
What about the action day and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with support from the Zollernalb Sparkasse.
It will be delivered in the children's garden on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the teachers and children themselves.
Kenian Presse embarrasssed by controversial media law
'We are in an alarming situation, and we must ask ourselves, 'What does Parliament think of simply disposing of judicial independence tomorrow', was read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law not constitutionally.
“The law is drakonic and very penal and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, which also belongs to Capital FM, one of the most viewed independent radio stations and news sites Kenias.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be pre-accepted, because it is an extended government arm,” and restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenia’s position in the global economy.
'I hope the President will listen to us, and we call on him to reject this draft of law and send it back to Parliament', he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, through the new law, the government “takes the media effectively into a cast-off”. On the other hand, The Standard, Democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya writes, “had suffered a severe hit” and called the draft as “draconic”.
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aiming at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
The Kenian media drew up the anger of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which the units sent to the crime site claimed to robbe the luxurious shopping centre.
Police director David Kimaiyo responded with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative to hear, even though the preloading was withdrawn after a screaming of the media.
According to the new law, media houses can be punished with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenian shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to take the property of the affected if a punishment is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “only one penalty can push most radio broadcasters into bankrotts”.
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a destructive effect on their description according to "live blogosphere" Kenias.
If they broke the media to silence, politicians could do without punishment whatever they want.
“None will ever know it,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist of the nation, who describes the Kenian media as a decisive control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians yourself, they lead the country into bankrott and us back to the time of the hunters and collectors”, he commented.
The Kenian legislators have already raised the public trouble in the past.
In May, they agreed to reverse the reductions arranged by the National Remuneration Commission and put back their decent salaries of about 532,000 shilling a month - they are among the highest worldwide.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream will be true for the FC
At the importance of the city and the football club, the official inaugural celebration for the artificial grass sports lot despite the cold weather and rain.
A more pleasant celebration would have desired all of us on Saturday, but Peter did not want to play in it.
Thus all those who came without a rainscreen or couldn't hold one for any reason.
This was the case with the musicians who embraced the festival, as did some speakers.
So Nass also became the president of the FC, Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were to all of those of the Mayor Walter Klumpp, who had been strongly engaged in the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies and members of the associations involved.
Particularly here Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The quiet retirements placed 400 square meters of patch stones for the new paths.
This remarkable honorary commitment also appreciated the Landtagsabgeordnet Karl Rombach.
Further greetings spoke to the city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South-Badian Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Office, who announced a donation for the Youth Department of the Club.
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that in the spring and autumn, repeating whitening-related influences added to the original race space so that he could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to solve the problem when the construction of a third place at the ground of the football club or at the real school at the Salinensee was considered.
Both were rejected.
Six years ago thoughts came up for the establishment of an artificial grass sports site, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was launched two years ago, when the FC took over the shelves in herb pacht, a cost contribution of 100 000 euros for the construction of the place and the country approved funding of 104 000 euros.
In October 2012, the Council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of EUR 560 000, Klumpp summed together.
The construction start of the 68 times 108 meters of artificial grass square took place on June 4th.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were deducted, of which half was used for the construction of a Dirt-Bike Stream.
The Union and the SPD continued their coalition negotiations with internal and judicial issues.
The competent working group gathered in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, Membership and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Group also wanted to continue their discussions.
It should include double citizenship, in which both sides have contradictory ideas.
The SPD wants to stop the force for immigrant children born in Germany - the Union rejects a double pass.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the meeting order on this Friday, the SPD supported its no to a car hire required by the CSU.
A Vignette was a "Flatrate for multi-cycle and thus ecologically contraproductive", explained the SPD negotiator for transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
It threatened landweight traffic, which are already major accidents.
The introduction of a wall for all cars would also be a first step from the viewpoint of Pronolds.
"There is a danger that the compensation for Germans will be removed at a later time," he said.

Vienna Airport terminates passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
In the future there will be no more throughsages like this at the Vienna-Schwechat Airport.
Most of the speaker's throughsights are dropping away - the noise mirror is supposed to be reduced so clearly.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport speakers Peter Kleemann announced against Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of individuals' perceptions.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already reluctant to the noisy calls.
By the decay of these persuasivenesses - on an average, about 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - it is expected to go more quiet at the airport.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual throughsages have been relatively little observed, but at the same time all other information on changed flight elevations or departure times are going a little down here," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio sender.
Highlander-Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the tractor tractors, there is a second competition at the farm autumn festival on the Coltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday 7 September, the Highlander Games start at 13.30 p.m.
Although they have a schottic tradition, they are swallowed at the cold courtyard.
Teams and individual fighters measur in the disciplines of tree stamp throws, hufes, and water drills.
Four and a half meters are the tree stamp long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It doesn't come on far," explains organiser Peter Saile.
The tribe must be thrown off vertically, should be overlooked once and then just come to lie.
This is assessed by most points.
The target accuracy is reached when it comes to chickening.
From eight meters distance is thrown on a plot.
Skills and power must be demonstrated by participants in the water drilling over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottich are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two may then participate in individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition get prices.
Train can be trained from 10 o'clock.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the fighters can enter the casting rock.
However, we are also allowed to take a fragile trait.
For "outfit" the jury forgives a few more bonus points.
You can log in up to one hour before competition starts.
With the schott-swbish highlander gams and the Traktor-Pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there has been a lot of action on the festival site on Saturday.
In the evening, the Blasmusic Friends are at their expense.
At nine o'clock, the biraboromian blass music from Schumberg is the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays beautiful Polcas and marbles.

Organisators are the Funderverein Multipurpose Hall, the ski club and the Traktor Friends "Tandkepele".
Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegane diet requires vegan alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
For example, pleasant tofu with plant tooth is a quart set.
Others call the Vegetarian Association for the World Vegetarian Day on 1 November.
The Vegetarian Association Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives at the World Vegetarian Day on 1 November:
Pure plant margarines are a good alternative to butter, yoghurt lets replace with soja yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, harbour, mandel or rice milk can be used.
Apprehensible plant teeth inherit conventional teeth.
There are also vegetable alternatives for eggs.
A half-cracked, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple mushrooms or a dining lean seeds and three dining leafs of water are suitable for it.
Locators will be deeds instead of eggs, for example with a mixture of a tea open back powder, a dining leaf food strength and three dining leafs mineral water.
But also 50 grams soja yoghurt or sildentofu can fulfil this purpose.
According to Vebu, about 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany, i.e. purely planted.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their guest families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Schwarzwald gymnasium met the American capital of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it immediately went to Brooklyn Bridge, over which the heart of the city, Manhattan, was reached.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-known Skyline, which in the evening light represents a special rice.
Due to the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but faithfully the motto "The City doesn't sleep" was decided on the day on the Times Square.
Despite shutdown on the second day, the stand of freedom could be reached with a ferry and climbed to foot.
It then went about the Wall Street financial centre to the Memorial of 11 September.
On the third day, the students from the 373 metres high view platform of the Empire State Building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city and enjoy the view.
Afterwards, it went through the hectic drive of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to get short in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their guest families and experience the school all-day at the Weymouth High School.
This year also a Hubertus Messe is celebrated on the name day of the Holy Hubertus in the Pfarrkirche St. Marien on the Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the case after a quite reluctant hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed the bishop of Lieich.
The Hunting Horn Blazer Group of the Hunter of Westfalen under the leadership of Brigitte Kluth Musicates on Parforcehorns (Naturhorns in the Voting Es) to old, original French melodies.
The blades wear riding clothing because they primarily accompany horses, horses and dogmaids musically on slope hunting.
The celebration fair takes place on Sunday 3 November at 11.30 p.m.
The newly designed hit shines with a new cafe.
One that invites us to rejoice and welcome.
One that wants to make the name the program.
According to the Lexikon, Déjà Vu is called a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of the visit of the like-named café at the hit in the Circle Cluster in view of the University of Rhine-Waal, it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, with the beautiful name, the café has exactly that goal: to make a real stay not only thoughtful, but to make a handhold ever again experienceable.
Because it's just funny and just nice.
A look into the inner life of the look 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The high-modern, but not cool café agent looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team convenes the guest with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various coffee or cocktail variants.
For this, there are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have made a name before opening the decorative cafes on the record: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the hit, the sympathetic café lovers hoped more audiences.
Not least also through the university.
"Where we don't have a specific target group," Daniel Büttner stresses.
Rather, the two young students here want to respond as well as seniors and all age classes between them.
Apropos Café-Liebhaber.
The sympathic owner couple is behind the coffee-genuss.
Enjoy the fragrance of hot breeze in the various variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso-Fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"To this, a baguette - that's my thing," she explains to the NRZ.
Two events were already in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the port party took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnacht evening.
"Great, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büntner is not a pronounced fan of events evening: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event, I always speak to only those who are also interested in the special event.
That is why events will be more the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the entire normal operation as little as possible."
To say: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
As regards the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the climbing in Kleve.
The road, which becomes a gastronomic miles more and more.
To the pleasure of many clevers, the guests from near and far away and the students who discover the Gastromeiles and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation feast to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and her wives, were happy to come.
In the association room of the "Witteborg" restaurant in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious intercourse entirely in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate festivity to make honors.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener was happy about the special award "Singers of the Year".
"You have not only written much for us, but you have also turned so many rounds for us, for our warm thanks," said the chairman of the Chores Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir samples by means of activity bouts this year went to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by Horst Pier-Ribbert, the Chairman himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants.

The "Friedrich-Wilhelm" MGV meets its regular choir samples every Tuesday at 19.45 p.m. in the association room.
"New song joyful voices are welcome to us at any time," said Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets in the fight against poverty
The United Nations starts with the preparation of a number of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Objectives announced 12 years ago for the fight against poverty.
In front of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the promotion of “sustainable development goals” to replace the Millennium targets for 2015.
They were included in the final draft document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, said on the summit on the evening that the time had come to be “overlooking the national interests”.
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to initiate a process which should be agreed with universal, sustainable development objectives,” he said.
“This goal will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I will not be ashamed of implementing this mandate by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development objectives, which are based on the success of the Millennium objectives."
Even if the SG Achim/Bads have been without victory for four days, the handball officers continue to have a good mood.
That's what trainer Tomasz Malmon doesn't give any doubt.
Everyone continues to be fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we will finally win again.
"For I don't even know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the Thirdliga Reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet ripped out trees, Malmon in front warns the point finger.
Many players I have trained myself in the A-Young.
Therefore, they will certainly be very motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is necessary to wait to see if the first one is still strengthening," explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team has to increase in any case compared to the previous performances.
In front of all things in the covering work and in the shift game, it last hapered enormously.
The use of opportunities must also be definitely improved.
That's why I hope my players finally got their head free during the short break.
Security minds in Mozambique grow in view of conflicts between influenceful individuals
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mosambik, to vote for a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, manager of an investment company.
From fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothing against a T-shirt with the title "We require security" into Portuguese and joined itself on Thursday the quantity on the capital's independence place.
For two weeks there have been nearly daily reports of collapses between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, which was initially supported by the rhodesia ruled by Whites and later the apartheid government of South Africa in the effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a growing conflict, but recent events have disturbed foreign investors and locals.
The rapidly growing economy is at stake, as the discovery of huge gases in front of the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investments of more than 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the next few years.
The reigning Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent collapses by attacking its members in the Province of Sofala, a traditional highburg renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo support points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamo's speakers to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the collapses and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to reduce concerns about instability.
Against AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regards himself as a “loser” who wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can force his decisions to the government.
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo has ceased the 1992 peace agreement.
On the contrary to the FT, he explained that it meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our vision is to restart negotiations and seriously," said Mazanga.
Earlier discussions between the parties have only contributed little to the approximation of tensions that have been fired by a number of collapses this year.
“We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who collapse the heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, teacher at the Open University and Mosambik experts.
None of them are good in negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pressing for election reforms, has already explained that she will bonocott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and Parliament elections are planned next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a violating movement to produce concessions and financial benefits by the government.
Renamo's election result since 1992, while a newer party, founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – if his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He doesn't want a multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the Presidential Office," said Mazanga.
It is unclear about the capacity of Renamo, but it has made unresting attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the fights took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied to the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted “the international community to warn that things are not good in Mozambique”, said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, leader of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already concerned about corruption, the slow progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave.
“The people think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrant, said that people just wanted stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again,” he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "exemplars of life", says a author.
The stories of Thor showed that “brutal power has no chance against clever tricks”, and the Artus-learning demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are “very too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools”, so Crossley-Holland pleaded for an ‘carious selection’ of old-just works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklores are already part of education,” he said.
I've been proposing this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that in authors and teachers who are "excessively educational" children would be "completely off" because in entertaining stories the messages would be "suppressive".
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Angelsaxic and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, stated: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as possible.”
The most likely difference between an adult author who writes for adults and a writer who writes for children is in the need to give hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the Happy End, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subtlely represented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
Heinrich Hansjakob, who was in his age rest in Haslach 100 years ago, became his last years alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic of the very brief scene game.
From the arrival of the award of honorary citizenship to his death, the author and Hansjakob writer Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a pleasant piece that received a lot of approval under Cornelia Volk's regime.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained conjunctions and overwhelmed time jumps from youth to nearly retirement.
On October 22, 1913 Hansjakob comes home in his children's sky, in his courtyard.
And then the scene game began in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stilecht went with the two-spinner and "Black-twitter Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause, but also his sister Philippine welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredible well to join the sister's role and gave her an immense life in Mimik and Gestik.
Between the individual stages, the Mühlenbacher Farmerkapelle played appropriately selected musical pieces and rounded the performance.
Heinz Winkler, then, the Mayor of Haslach's Mayor of Heinz Winkler, gave the honor to the honor of the Honorable Honor, who, together with a part of the Council of the City, made his expectation in representation of the official owner of Heathich.
Her expectation then made the three king singers that Hansjakob exclaimed: "Aye how beautiful, there will be youth memories of my own three kings time alive."
With their song "O Jesulein", they enjoyed the audience in the courtyard as well as the storchentag children with their loud "out, out".
His criticism at the official church had expressed Hansjakob as much as his concerns about the growth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the consequences of war.
In the homeyard, behind his grave chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his place of rest.
"A distressed spirit had finally found his peace and had gone home forever," said it at the end of the scene game.
There were many applauses and many praiseful words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Riesen grows
The chances of the Liga remaining of the sports decreasing Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballers have risen.
Because there should be a wildcard procedure, then there is a smaller candidate for the Neckar Riesen.
The Basketball project Hamburg Towers refuses to apply for a possible background.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard procedure," said ex-National player Pascal Roller, who since 2012 set up the concept of a professional in Hansestadt.
However, a first breath was not to be taken from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not work on the Wildcard procedure, so long as Düsseldorf doesn't get a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Upsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the arbitrary court until 23 May and demonstrate its economic goodness.
However, the license has been refused twice to the Rhine countries.
The arbitrary court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Evening Meal Church enters the viewpoint
As a contribution of the city to the 150-year-old existence of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office dedicates the last of its this year's public topics on Sunday, October 27, the Evening Meal Church.

The meeting point to the second half-hour leadership is at the nuclear cellar museum at 15 o'clock.
There are cards on the box of the atomic cellar museum.
The tourist office of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former U.S. Secret Service Expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. Seafare.
Representatives of the Federal State Prosecutor may either ask written questions or contact the 30-year-old in Russia personally.
This announced the Interfax Agency, calling for unnamed circles who were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified in the intergovernmental context, said it.
A trip to Snowdens from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the Agency quoted its source.
Because Germany was allies in the United States, there drew Snowden the delivery, it continued

Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard also invested strongly in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the neck.
The company has several irons in fire at the location.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard also uses wind plant logistics.
Black shining the stone coal in the camping place in front of the deck.
Two huge blue shades and recharge devices distribute or load the coal here as needed.
In every movement of the envelopes, a shrilled warning sound is sounding over the archipelago.
"The signals serve security and are legally required," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavourable wind, this is widely heard - and so there were some complaints from people from the city order.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those concerned, says the 40-year-old.
In close agreement with the authorities, the warning signals are now being kept lighter with technical measures.
He will also focus on open dialogue with the neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has a lot before the location.
With the expansion of the Niedersachsen bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to focus on coal imports for power plants and is one of the greats in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5 meter deepened form terminal, Capesize bulkcarriers can also be finished here long ago.
"This year we want to knock the 3 million tons mark in the envelope," says Schrell.
Besides the local Eon power plant, the coal is going to power plants in the country.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the net, more than 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three shiploaders on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bavarian Basketballer Despite the first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not defeat the huge optimism in the basketballers of the FC Bayern Munich.
"None can ban us to believe even to win against the best team of Europe in the last two years," the Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic balanced after the unhappy 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the title defender Olympiakos Piräus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their first third appearance in the European royalty class, the coins sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first created the piece of art to convert a 15-point backward 13 minutes before the end to a guide before piräus gave the game a turn again.
"We have incrediblely struggled back against the two Euroleague Champion, but then again made lightweight mistakes," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful hosts of the coins who had celebrated significant victory in the first two parties against the Italian Serial Champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish Tracker targetona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the Variete Artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conferencier at the Palace Theatre at Broadway, began to tell the lot of jokes in the form of a conversation.
Fay's innovation has been developed over the years, as recently on the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival this year celebrates his ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of these headliners began with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were known to appear in a club,” said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event there are appearances of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as of “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual musical and comedy beneficiary event for armyveterans in Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of Comedy has also grown.
A number of Comedians who participate in the festival this year have become known on rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasting on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a Sitcom in cable TV (the ironic-slipped fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has its own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation both at the Saturday Night Live and at “Parks and Recreation”, although it is the best known for her viral video series “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironical, racial themes concentrated on W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American Comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a viewed television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historic.
From 2005 to 2007, he managed a TV broadcast with the title “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the town hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he was here, then sometimes he goes through the street between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I may live here.
Iran satisfactory with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran will be shown a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veterinarians and Germany satisfied with the negotiating process.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences of the last years," wrote Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way, but the nuclear operator is satisfied with the negotiating process and also optimistic that both sides will come to a solution at the end.
Drama in Uruguay: boys kill game chamber lines with Machete
Two children have admitted the murder of an 11-year-old man in Uruguay.
The two 14 - and 12 - year - old boys had invited their victims to go on bird hunting with them.
With mashes and knives, they gun the 11-year-olds on Tuesday and throw the body into a well, reports the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played football before their apartments in a worker quarter.
The body was found the following night in the Cerro Pelado village, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach town Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five - year - old half-sister of the young man who had taken them should say that she was sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl before the police described the tatherway without mentioning a attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a basis, the older ones called a rivality in the football game.
He was provisionally delivered to a psychiatric youth establishment.
Contributor must be in prison
Due to exploitation of human trafficking, conservation, threat, pollination and dangerous body injury, the Landgericht has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years of prison.
The former federal army soldier, who worked as a door steward in Afghanistan after two interventions, confessed in a process agreement.
Thus, in five cases he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on the line after a few weeks against her will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He maintained the incomes of women who purchased for some years for him.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards he interfered with women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who communicated the women, he brought them into various tables in the southwest.
There he had them partially monitored to control their revenues.
In front of the court, the accuser first claimed that he suffered under a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had killed him next to a explosion.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the mental limitation and thus on a restricted guilt, the 33-year-old declared a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any of the injured women anymore.
As one Kripo official reported, after a first advertisement by telephone monitoring measures, at least four other cases of exploitation of human trafficking could be identified.
The interviews had been influenced by high aggression.
In later trials, the damaged would have confirmed their martyrium.
Another Witness, where one of the women had discovered blue spots around the body, has not made any statement until today.
It is "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this metier as normal.
The charger regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has redeemed out of these circles and wants to live a very normal life after the prison," he said.
Oil price continues to be up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price has also continued on Friday, after concerns about a high offer overshadowed a report as to which China's energy starving manufacturing sector grows.
In the late morning in Europe, the reference raw materials for delivery in December had fallen in electronic trade at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to 96.24 USD per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price loss of 5.8 percent in October.
The large raw oil supply has loaded prices in recent weeks.
The US Energy Ministry stated on Wednesday that the U.S. offer increased by 4.1 million barrel last week.
In the course of five weeks, the offer had increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was evidence of greater demand by two reports on an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This indicates a continuing recovery of China's economy, whose growth increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after the lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from the type Brent, a reference value for international raw oil, which is also used by US-American Raffineria, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court blocks the decision to stop and freeze the NYPD Directive
On Thursday, a Federal Officer in the United States blocked the order of a judge, which had requested changes to the Stop-and-Fris programme ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department, and refrained the judge from the case.
The second US profession court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision was made on the call of the city.
The judge had judged in August, the city infringed the Constitution with the way the program was implemented for the persecution and questioning of persons.
The city initiated appeal against its assessment and the measures taken, including the decision to establish a supervisory body to support the police in amending their Directive and the appropriate training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report explained that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she infringed the code of conduct for US-American judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged, police officers violated the citizens' rights of tens of thousands of people, because they in an inappropriate way called black and Latin American men with the stop-and-fresh program in the vision.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot programme with cameras carried on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after a police control.
A oral hearing on the calling of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-Frisk tactics were criticized by a number of civil rights opponents.
The controls of this kind have been available for decades in different forms, but the number of recorded controls increased during the term of office of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg to a full-time height of 684.330 in 2011, most of which black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, who belonged to all minorities, filed a complaint that developed into a collective complaint.
Proposers of changes to the NYPD's Stop-and-Frisk programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and effective police and influence the way other police presidies apply the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would weaken the morals of the police, but not crime; nor would money waste and would not solve the wider problem of a police, which is under pressure after the deceased of thousands of posts last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-fresh practice that was constitutional, but reformed only the way of the implementation of the controls by the NYPD.
From the Happiness of the Dreaming Cameles
Happy is a oase that succeeds to reach only dreaming chambers
The first president of Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Healing Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already prove considerable successes.
The first president, Henne, reported in detail about the work of the Association.
In 2004 he was the first time in Mauritania at the Cheikk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the Gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on several trips on site.
During the talks, pictures were shown by the interventions on a large canvas, so the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the actions mentioned.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, former OB of Nagold, had proposed that this vehicle should be equipped with a photovoltaic position and now, according to Henne, plan to be acting in advisory function at the association.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleh from Baiersbronn created the hospital station in Socogim, an elendsquartier on the edge of the capital, in the record time of just a week.
She also mentioned a new mother-child disease house in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be rationalized in Nagold.
You learn a lot in Africa as a medical person, like Henne, for example deceleration against burn-out.
Because of the political disturbances in the country, it was not possible to travel as many as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to visit here in various areas.
In addition, regular containers with material are sent to Africa, such as in March this year medical equipment, medications, alloy materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local co-orit by telling from Mauritania from Mercedes' converted to the mobile goats and painting the experiences of the tribal musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young member.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help Africans in control of a budget by the people.
Feuchtel also stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
Gran Canaria was not far from Africa.
Coulson inserted phone hacking for checking a hint
The former news of the Word publisher Andy Coulson claimed to use “telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation” in attempting to confirm a false tip on an affair of Charles Clarke, then.
State lawyer Andrew Edis QC explained to the Old Bailey Court, News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special consultant" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper invited the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's Voicemails and followed them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court heard.
“After the opinion of the state lawyer, Coulson, who is now publisher of the NotW, is no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to take it up for a fresh act, but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction,” explained Edis.
He said, NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories in research: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Apparently, he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He struggles, but we say, "And if he knew of it."
Smoking about an affair of Clarkes was first taken by the functional redaction of NotW when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Do not waste your time, she is with Charles.”
A band with Voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
The mediators also found entries on the computer of the detective on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as “projects”.
In the time of the research, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls when they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
In the meantime, the former Chefreporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former minister David Blunkett.
The vows heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced with a married woman because of an affair, when he himself was lying to the co-explained Rebekah Brooks who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks refuse to have sworn with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned rich tax, the French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without results.
In the conflict about the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have been manoeuvred in a sackgasse after a failure to conciliate.
Although President François Hollande received their complaints on Thursday at the Paris Élysée Palace, he also received the requests of the Association and Association Representatives.
However, he refused to reimburse the football from the planned 75 percent levy on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies of the country should pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, the Chief Association of Profi Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, announced.
The playdays in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 between November 29 and December 2 are therefore expired.
Geching: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in planning," the Mayor Jens Hausler opened the civil information event for the high-water protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to introduce ideas.
Heads made clear: "The final decisions are the members of the municipal council."
The high water, which was unprepared on 15 May 2009, had been an intervening event that raised the issue of protection measures for the future, said Huußler.
A river area investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the water protection concept in Gechingen.
"Protecting as many buildings as possible is the goal," said Huußler.
For reasons, the planning of protection against a high water to be expected every 100 years according to the German weather service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent supplement.
This is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The masses of waters that resulted in significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 were equivalent to a 1000-year-old high-water.
"A absolute protection is not available, but a relative improvement can be achieved," said Huußler.
In order to achieve HQ 100aKlima protection, some four million euros need to be invested in Gechingen, while the municipality can expect national subsidies of around 70 percent.
However, heads pointed out that there is only support when a overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the municipality is required to participate in the citizens.
A profound planning and approval procedure has to be completed.
In the best case, the implementation can be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which has been presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides local measures in the flux of the river Irm from the valley of the tribe.
Following the presentation of the high-water protection concept, participants used the opportunity to introduce their concerns.
Among other things, the reason was questioned why no more dams and restraint baskets were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist in the commissioned engineering office of Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interaction of all the proposed measures to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, it should be kept to find the most economic solution, so Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Unfortunately, even in normal weather rains, there was an overload of the channel network.
The problem is known in administration and first measures have already been taken.
However, heads pointed out that the directives for channel systems are other than for high-water protection and that should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be carried out.
To dimensionate the waste water channels, millions would swallow.
Heavy injured after collapse
On early Friday afternoon, two car drivers have been severely injured on the Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf during a frontal collapse.
The police locked the street immediately, but could not say much about the accident at first.
However, there are several testimony statements that should be first evaluated.
The 19-year-old steward of a VW golf went to Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collapsed, while the woman was so tightened that the firearm needed nearly half an hour to release them from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of accident was not cleared at first.
Both accidents came in nearby hospitals.
The route remained about two hours fully locked.
You could call him Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Surprisingly the relativeness in the outer: the stinging eyes, the bart, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul with his massive oeuvre, Philip K. Dick is read as American prophets, which in his own country is quite a little considered.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne publishing, the Haffmans Cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousands.
Dick explains America - the empire of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security threat and faith to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture from the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, he had drugs added to his brain.
He understood, early, that the computers are Divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a person from a machine, the Creator of his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minderities-Report" comes from 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunale.
It is developed here the principle of "pre-crime", "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, who looks as terrible as ours, mutants look in the future - and the police attack.
"We record individuals who have not violated any law," says the Head of Authority.
"We'll take them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And, "In our society there are no heavy criminals, for that we have a prison camp full of Pesudo criminals". They read time flows.
They assume that evil happens and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick's story works like the blue break for the anti-terror laws and the NSA's hearing roast.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophie and -praxis works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The Head of Police complains that there is no more division of violence, the military controls everyday life - and what is left from the state.
Then the guard will be monitored and carried over a future crime.
The system's turning through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Take wrongdoers and victims not only in purchase, but build themselves on it.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means always to get closer to the truth.
Sphere of Merkel in Russia
The former U.S. Secret Service Expert Edward Snowden could make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. Seafare of Federal Cancillor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor may either ask written questions or contact the 30-year-old in Russia personally, the Agency reported Interfax.
Previously, the Greenen-Bundestag-Abgeordnete Hans-Christian Ströbele had met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the business.
Increase NSA disclosures Firmenparanoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter fled deeply over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On instruction from the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BVT), the German Home Service, it should photograph the roof of the U.S. External Post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a exchange of words between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again stated in September that the United States did not use opportunities for foreign spying, “to steal the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US-American companies, so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit.”
However, since Edward Snowden, who becomes the Whistleblower, has started publishing his fillhorn to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and managers are no longer sure whether they can speak to the director.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spyed out the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the company Paranoia has brought a new maximum level for state surveillance.
The Fass to Overflow brought the discovery that Chancellor Angela Merkels' phone had been disguised, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can get into the vision, then firm management is also potential goals.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Green, President of the BITMi, representing small and medium IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States now represented a almost as high risk as China when it comes to industrial spying and data thief steel, such a survey published in July by the consultative company EY.
However, in Snowden's documents, there has not been any evidence that the United States have passed on the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet possibilities and should reduce its dependence on the United States.
The companies are skeptical in this regard.
In the Bundestag we were suggested to build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised from coal over cars to agriculture.
Everything, up to the IT Branch.
Nevertheless, the scope and technical raffinity of the US spionage authorities discovered by the Snowden discoveries shocked companies who had previously seen the largest spying risk in China.
Cloud Computing is a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the USA are subject to the law and are potentially endangered.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, rejected after disclosures on the US data mining activities with Prism about ten percent of the non-US members plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Vice-President of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers that did not exist a year ago – it says: Where are my data stored and you can guarantee that these are physically staying in this jurisdiction?”
Many German managers believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be monitored at any price.
That economic spying takes place is not surprising.
It's always been that way.
“It has been a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Chemistry Company BASF.
The Americans spy us out at commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
Usually, the management of the companies does not pretend about the counter-measures taken, as this brings advantages to attackers.
In large companies, employees have been inspired for a long time that taking a free USB piece on a fair or the unattended leave of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, gently said.
Ulrich Hackenberk, director of Audi's car manufacturers, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as a hearing device.
The German BVT advises leaders to use simple prepaid phones when they go on abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The Prepaid Handys are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain viable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective nisch.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect operating secrets against unauthorised access”, the BAT warns in a report.
The United States warns its own companies from economic spying through other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February, in the US National Intelligence Estimate, France, Russia and Israel were assigned to rank two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from the hacking.
A member of the board of a German Blue Chip company agreed in the case of economic spying, then “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French Intelligence Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The secret services know very accurately that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, spy out their allies."
Hechingen: Messe answers to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery trip that man can do," said the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding celebration succeeded, now gave a special knife in the domain in Hechingen.
Inspected were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The Retro-Look retained.
This starts for example with the wedding dressers.
White is musts, best covered or in cream.
Besides, the frequently rusted and closed clothing with sticks, often with a sleeve, on the other hand, they go down the back and often end in a loop.
However, as the spirits separate, as Stefanie Koch stresses from the fashion house of clothing.
For men, the suit dominates with West and Plastron, but it can also be selected cream coloured or brown combinations.
Important is the selection of the locale, has been explained.
Non-profit rooms are not optimal, the ambient should be special.
Here the domain highlighted its own offer in the Remise.
Whoever then wants to go with the cup, for whom Uwe Link has an offer.
"Sounds are also popular for boys' celebrities," he says.
Romantics are also requested for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "After-Wedding-Photo" - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, some days after the festival, but in wedding dress, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magic, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain stylishly.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable festival.
Dog Friends Successful
For repeated times, the athletes of the dogfriends Bitz were successful on a Rally-Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his dogma Sandy he reached 94 points in the beginner class and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley, he brought it with 87 points to place twelve.
Susi Höpp with her Woody in Class 1 faced the critical views of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a collapsed ringer matte at the tournament of his high school are convinced that her son was murdered, the lawyer of the family explained on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11, in a occupied Matt that was behind the tribun in the school tournament.
The sheriff of Lowndes County’s investigation officers concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, however, which doubts the family of the 17-year-old.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” said Benjamin Crump, lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
You never believed he died as the sheriff concluded.
“They believe that it does not exist in any logic, that it violates the laws of physics as well as the healthy human understanding,” says Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be lost to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school and came back in the body bag," he commented.
U.S. State lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation of Johnson's death, as a number of important questions were still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I represent the view that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation,” he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson died from the consequences of “position-related disorders”.
However, another autopsy caused another cause of death, says Moore.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added, if there is sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil law investigation on Johnson's death, he would be ordering the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
A court in the south of Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities had to release all the monitoring videos that the mediators have checked.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence of how he died.
Publishing allergies for schools CDC
On Wednesday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a number of directives on the treatment of food allergy from children at school.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. Government, as the number of children in school with food allergies increases.
One of the 20 children in the United States has now a food allergie.
The spread of food allergy in children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to CDC.
The guidelines include information for schools that should raise consciousness of food allergy in educational bodies and employees and how to treat children who have allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools provide epinephrin – the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used – to meet potentially fatal hypersensitivity reactions.
The lawmakers in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have a allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something presses my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "My tongue is cribing".
Parents of intersexual children can choose “inconsistent sex”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognised for children born with unidentified genetics.
Newborns are no longer assigned stare male or female.
According to the new law, parents do not have to explain gender to such children, but can indicate "undetermined" or "non-defined" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make excessive decisions in relation to operations for a gender assignment in newborns and combat discrimination between sexual people.
According to BBC, a intersexual person said years later: “I am neither man nor woman.”
I'm staying the girlpiece that was created by doctors, diminished and filled with fools.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children is not born as a boy or a girl every year.
They are among the intersexuals, a group falling under the diagnosis “Sex Difference Disorder” (DSD), a collective concept for people with atypical chromosomes, chemotherapy (eggs or hooks) or unusually developed genetics.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States recommend that the best available information for sex allocation be used if a provision is not possible and not waiting for the child's psychological and physical development before you decide – if at all – for surgery.
The New York Psychiater Dr. Jack Drescher, who specialized in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “click for a good thing”.
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but most children do not,” he said.
You can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the development of the identity.
The scientific data on how a child develops his sexual identity at all are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are homosexuals.
A report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender-persons, because their status is not gender-related, but by their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These qualities were demonstrated in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and statue, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genetics, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination that is exposed to intersexual and transgeneral persons in professional life, as well as the extent of infringement, violence and prejudice.
The boys who are not in line with the gender picture now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to refer to official documents of male, female or ‘dritte sex’.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognised as the first “familiar” person in the world after a court had granted lifelong maintenance of a “non-defined” sex status.
In addition to M and W, German certificates will have a third allocation, X for intersexual, so the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender topics are still controversial, so a news release to France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “Gadly Theory” from school books.
The US-American Website Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law, with the reason: “If the world is distorted into a new condition where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two further pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to the Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“The parent is even stressed enough without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the family of your own child,” she said to the parent’s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were referred to as Hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God, who had both gender.
Even ten years ago, the medicine viewed the sex as something that could be eliminated and then rebuilded.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are questioned, after now it is known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when he grows up with the sex assigned by them.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not called the psychiater, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with non-existing genetics goes back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the sex was formable.
He presented the term “sexual identity” and argued social and environmentally-related infringements – as the parents raised a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and influenced whether a person regarded himself as male or female.
But in a case known under the title “John/Joan” from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a consumed circumcision, to castrate the child entirely and also remove his coughs and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of transformation, but what he was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he returned to male sex and married a woman.
But with 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these gender operations have come to the public, which are "not happy with the result".
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, born with XY-man chromosomes, but two-digit genitaly.
The doctors were not aware of whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and the Hoden were removed surgically shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12 he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressive and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical documents.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, by which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of genetics.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosteron injections and was removed from his breasts.
The surgery has made it unfruitable.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersexual people as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the Californian legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law can “cover to stamps and stigmatize”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign a ‘non-defined’ to the child,” she explained.
We're afraid that's beneficial to interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But yet we do not know how the law will affect, so we can only wonder.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law because “it allows adults to recognize as a third generation”.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex," she explained.
The German law concerns the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to force small children at that time.
When they are grown up, they can decide on their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburg, who has a daughter with a sexual discriminatory disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorized" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete drug resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but she doesn't have an uterus and no egg sticks.
Today, Katie 29 is married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a member of the child psychiatry.
Although she is unfruitable, it hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or a mature.
“The law gives parents room, not having to make overwhelming decisions,” said Baratz.
It gives them time to make different tests and clarify things and give them time before they write "man" or "woman".
In this way everything is okay – you grow up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parents' happiness.
And you don't have to make a surgery that can no longer be reversed.
“This involves the children in the decision and removes the fear that parents are raising because they think they would not do the right,” she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that suits it better – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injured girls by shooting from car
Unknown people have injured a twelve-year-old in Sachsen-Anhalt in the case of shots from a car.
The killers had probably fired a group of children on Thursday night in Genthin with an air pressure weapon.
That's what the police told in Burg.
The girl was easily injured on the left wade.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The killers also shot on a bus stop.
A disc broken.
Then they left.
The police detected it on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to elephant children, which were thrown against domestic facades.
Since the owners of the house recognized this in time and the egg residues were equally removed, there would not have been any damage to the matter.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller have probably also been burned in the city area, but there has not been any damage to the matter.
A resident at the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was compiled with clo-pair and his bicycles were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man has discovered his radcierblends in the immediate vicinity of all who did not have to work on the police.
Living with a future perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives dreamy.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes with public transport.
"You're hopefully not afraid of spinning?" asked Waltraud Ries and pointed to a fat spine at the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spinning phobia, but the concern that, in the age, the many stairs of the house and the apartment are not able to handle, she explains.
In addition, since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifty girl has had to learn on his own body what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor.
Recently, a book of her has been published on the subject 'Happy living in the age - What is the best living for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on in the age," she begins to tell.
When she moved to the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, with mid-fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are at all dealing with the subject of 'welling in the age'.
Most of them are pushing it as long as it goes.
Old will always be just the others', she says swallowing.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really high, you are thinking.
"Then it can be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for self-determined living in the age.
"What kind of living you choose is always an individual decision," she explains.
D ie solution is not available for the age.
Even who can afford the rest of the age in Tuscany or the Bretagne should always think that he can become sick too.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the language of the country, you are also united in Dolce Vita,' the specialist author has to think of the residential volunteers.
Their models include classic care models, alternative living forms or the often quoted pensioners WG.
In the age, everyone has his ticks and Mackens
'For me would be such a living community, but nothing,' she says with a eyewitcher.
Not at all like in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"In age, you just need your backspaces," says Ries.
However, the book author does not want to exclude the fact that a senior housing community can still work.
However, this had to be different from the classic students-WG.
And sometimes you just want your rest,' she believes.
With that opinion, at least in the capital of the country, it is not alone.
'The majority of old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment' is also the experience of Theresa Rutten, the leader of civil service life in the age of the capital of the country.
Their office advises people around the subject of 'Becoming older'.
Therefore, just older people would often also purchase inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their habitual environment, which is also the experience of the Foundation of Product Tests.
There are many opportunities today to make the house or the apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all who are dealing with the age-right reconstruction of their home or apartment, first inform themselves thoroughly and not in charge of the first craftsman.
Today there are also specialists for the age-right reconstruction.
Even in the rental apartment, this is realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the inside architectural clarifies.
But it is not always possible to transform the existing apartment from old age and thereby without access, even if it is so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairs lift within the apartment, which would also be a much larger obstacle with stairs pleashed up to the door of the apartment.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she threw more than before the spin at her dwelling door.
United States wants to continue to pursue Snowden criminally
The United States has not changed their attitude toward the former U.S. Secret Service Employee Edward Snowden.
He would continue to be proposed of unauthorized sharing of secret information.
Therefore, he had to make a criminal proceedings in the United States, said the spokesman of the U.S. Foreign Ministry, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent statements of Snowden would also change nothing.
The German Green Politicist Hans-Christian Ströbele had earlier, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, appealed to the United States not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki emphasized that Stöbele's statements are those of a parliamentary and not those of a German government member.
Secret Service-chair Edward Snowden is essentially ready for a conversation with German authorities.
At first, however, he wants to clarify his situation.
This clarified the former NSA employees looking for by the United States in an un addressed letter, which published by the Green-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and sent forward to the Federal Government, Bundestag and General Bundesanwalt.
The letter has the following words, after a translation distributed by strawlers:
To the Competents
I was asked to write you about your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden, who has been working on contractual or direct appointment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became witness to systematic breaches of my government, which caused me from moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent hetze that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum that gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have assessed the disclosures to a system of comprehensive surveillance, which is not responsible for any account, as a service to the public.
These spionage disclosures made many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the predecessed abuse of public trust.
The benefit of society from these knowledge gains is increasingly clarified and at the same time the risks incurred were significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts proved positive, my government continues to treat Dissens as a treacherous breakthrough and seeks to criminalize and complain about political expression.
Nevertheless, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will refrain from this destructive attitude.
I hope that, when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been solved, I will be able to participate in the appropriate and legally responsible clarification of the facts made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I am looking forward to a discussion with you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for their efforts to safeguard the international law that protects us all.

Children's gardens have found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street sold the municipality to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "adjusted" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," emphasizes Maier.
There were 100 000 euros in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former children's garden.
The Mayor is right that Winterling has handed over the responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and thus no longer has to come up for the entertainment of the house, as to warm, look for the garden and clean the road.
"This effort is gone now," Maier is happy.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The music club Hammereisenbach provides a place concert on the terrace of the Hammer Gasthaus.
When Dirigentin Bianca Willmann lifts the tactstock at 19.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammrich musicians.
President Manuela Honeck explains the pieces of music.
Honeck thanked all those who had helped to manage the first musical hock successfully.
Report: Obama campaign planned to replace bids by Hillary Clinton
The closest consultants of President Barack Obama have in secret considered to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election struggle with Hillary Clinton, says the New York Times.
The distinguishing is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-expected work on the 2012 election struggle, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times is presenting a copy of the book that will appear sooner and she reported on Thursday night that the president's top consultants had conducted “great group sessions and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out whether Obama's descending hope for re-election would look better if he had let bids fall.
According to Jonathan Martin, the National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly draws the history of the efforts of leaders of the campaign and the White House, namely to measure the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, the impact on the survey values to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest consultants – including Daley, former campaign leader of Obama, Jim Messina, and former leader of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
In the "Double Down" it is claimed that Daley was at the top of the efforts to exchange bids despite their "incidence of personality", before the data showed that the candidate Clintons would "not significantly improve the chances of Obama".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered to replace Biden with Clinton.
"I spoke a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them," said Daley to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President had terrible survey values at that time, so we thought, "For God's will, what are we doing?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as ‘subscribed care’, Martin said to Anderson Cooper by CNN that during the campaign a significant effort had been made to re-elect significant in order to find out whether such a train would pay for the electoral clocks.
"In campaigns, not so much money is spent for surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin at AC360.
It is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about a exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the President of the possible change was ‘conscious’, the former Chief of Staff acknowledged that Obama had been ‘though possible’.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not give a definitive answer to the question whether the political distortions had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin whether he was seriously thinking that Obama had no idea of the investigations about whether to let bids fall in the elections.
"Accessible," Martin replied.
What's happening with my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was the draft of the Internet service e-mail technically implemented in similar terms as with the conventional post?
The conception of early Internet services focused on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account to create a stable foundation for a resistant exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open mail card rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", then the computers of the two are directly connected?
The e-mail program or the browser of Anna will first send the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider used by Benni.
On the route the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content with his provider.
Will conventional e-mails be read through the network on their way?
Most mails are read several times on the way by software robots.
For the provider of the sender, it is usually checked whether the mail is conducting a damage program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers shall check whether it is a malicious and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail via their coming holiday trips, Google can hide related links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails?
The probability of unauthorized people to read a mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Criminal and Secret Services also have legal opportunities to capture or note e-mails.
There are possible illegal excess actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be encrypted effectively against reading.
With a high technical effort, it is also possible to swallow the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to Convios Consulting from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a underlying role in the main private mail agents.
While the shares of Yahoo mail were last fallen, GMail from Google could clearly explain.
Mother shattered in the forest and pensioned
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg smote a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cash their pension and care money.
In order to continue paying pension and nursing money, an 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigations in the forest.
First he lost the death of the 89-year-olds, then he stretched the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: then it noticed that no medicine was needed for the nursing mother.
The retiror told the mediator that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this was strange to the officials, they continued to determine.
It was found that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, obduktion did not give rise to a capital crime.
Does it look like ice cream that lights in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice lighting in the dark – with the help of kwelling.
Charlie Francis made use of the fluorescing properties of the marine animals and created a bright lacquer.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on quarrels and could convince Chinese scientists to make the bright protein artificial.
The ice cream reacts when consuming with the tongue, which increases the pH in the protein and triggers the lighting.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights – the more you lick, the more it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is unbelievable, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the ice shines.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the follicle lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it's nice for that.
Charlie's experimental company in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and sheet gold.
But his newest creation is to become more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is in and for itself impossible because of the light breaking that is caused by the ice crystals that consist of ice cream; but I guess we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescing properties of a Qualle that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League after six play days.
Now it comes for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts again for us.
"I hope we finally have our head free," Ehlers acts optimisticly.
He finally has his entire cabinet, except for the lastly damaged Hendrik Blohme.
Also, there's a lot of pace playing like us.
That is why we have to keep our error rate low.
Firstly, however, it is necessary to increase in the coverage, which has last left everything other than a safe impression.
After the first season victory against the northern horn, Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz gives itself a more relaxed time.
Of course, the game was a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to relocate in Morsum to start a series.
Missing will be Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this, the A-Young Joost Windßuß, who is active in the A-Young-Boundsligist HC Bremen, celebrates his seasonal debut.
Whoever is not hot in such a game, should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was young, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween furnace.
In the last two years, I have not declared myself willing to distribute from my home from sweets, and I will probably not do it this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be accurate – celebrate Halloween this year and spend 6,9 billion US dollars for sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the US-American association of retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween again is the trend value.
The costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion US dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, rising unlived items are the last scream.
Women don't have to shelter themselves in sexy clothing, they can now also embodie fertile foods such as pizza, Hamburger or Carotten.
With regard to men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk Worldmen will make it to the Instagram Feds this year.
According to Google, the most visited costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and weren't alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
As for sweetness, we're not circumcisive.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, lutches, bonuses and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the US Ministry of Commerce, who go through the quarter with the speech "Sweet or Saures".
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we don't imagine – eat.
The only thing we don't want to eat is the sugar sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweetware Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion maize grains.
It's a puzzle I haven't been able to solve.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses in which it spooks.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognised spookhouses in the United States that earn 500 million dollars of sales, so America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just pink into the hose and then put the friends on Facebook, where you won't get rid of them again, and one of the types on whom you are standing leaves a comment like "nother face expression".
But let's finally get to the shorts.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Circle when we were children, and the cutting of a Circle Later is like the jewelry of the Christmas tree – something that we have made from small.
Fortunately, the “Baby in Kürbis” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us have grown up to cut the corbis and not to sit in it.
This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for shorts, according to the US Census Bureau.
The turbines, which are slowly rotating in the foregarden, are probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilometres were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and cut something nice from their 921 kilo heavy turbine.
Living fire in Helmbrecht: Rescue forces mountained body
The firearm had to get out of Helmbrecht on the late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night to Friday.
The rescue forces mountain a cold body out of the house.
In a fire in Helmbrecht, rescue forces have found a concealed body in a three-family house.
Whether it's about a inhabitant, it's still unclear as one speaker of the police in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday night it had burned in the ground floor of the house.
When the firearm arrived, the flames already slept out of a window.
The forces went to the apartment and found the body in one room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other inhabitants had not been at home during the fire, the police speaker continued.
The building is no longer inhabitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest national church has launched an open-sive to buy for the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible parish shortage: The Gospel-Lutherian National Church Hannover calculates that the number of their pastors will now be half by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day course itself.
With Burfien, the National Church has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full place to enthusiasm young people for theology study.
At present, fewer young people decide to study theology after the abitural.
Burfien brings this back to the process of churchification: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud."
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my appointment calendar and can set my priorities where it is important for me.
Pastors could be very close to people as a tailor.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
Surely there is more pay in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for this.
This comes to the young people today, not only about career, but about a senseful work.
According to the National Church, which includes three quarters of Niedersachsen, around 60 pastors are currently retired a year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of theology study begin their Vicariat.
In thinly occupied areas such as the harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could be difficult to occupy places.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organise student days for young people and also invite prominents who have studied theology.
The theology study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become a federal president.
Country Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are race seats and six-point bars as well as a free-speaking system.
The options are sufficient from enhanced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler Works engineers and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, manager of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced race drivers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventures and for an accessible way to world class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format includes new opportunities to experience the different Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare new ones for the struggles and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Waagen – that will be a entertaining mastership.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Called firearms for the rescue of a cave that sat 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock forehead in a stone break
Cockerspaniel-hondin Ruby had escaped after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the stone break in her malicious location.
Fire warriors sailed on the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The firearm managed to secure a cave that was set in a rock wall at a 15 meters high front.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who belonged to the dog, came to the Steinbruch Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thanks to the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for her missing dog and published auxiliary calls in social networks when she had escaped after the small traffic accident in the stone break.
About 14:15 o'clock on Wednesday, a walker, who carried out his dog, saw the scattered Ruby on the 15 meter high piece in the stone break.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station elapsed and sailed to the rescue of Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “It was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn't move muscle during her salvation – she was like steep frozen.
But now she's okay.
She then dinnered a few dog kitchens.
That was a pretty unusual effort.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a big happiness."
It was the possibility that she was very severely hurt or worse.
Ruby was investigated as a veterinarian but did not detect anything except fatigue and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "To look at salvation was anxious."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the fatigue had grown too great and it had collapsed, she would probably have crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid that she would fall down, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firemen were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio broadcaster this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer to Hungers' song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the old dryer at evening and that “he crawled me when I was 18 years old.”
She added: “This has been long ago and he was very nice to me.”
In a declaration, a representative of Hungers, 70, said on Thursday that he “categotially denied that he had ever tried to attend Katy Perry”.
The representative added: “She may have confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest performance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album “Prism” landed on site 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European deflection gives the shots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured along the Hadrianswall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed out the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this, as expected, did not matter in the headings.
No one has also mentioned that the EU Member States often comply with their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continuing non-respect for Brussels would only be a small consent in favour of what the shots really want.
So not really a story.
And one that has already come so in the years that it is already like a fossil: the first time I heard the “Independence means passport control” end at least 40 years ago.
A interesting point in repeating this ancient history is lost.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke against Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for Europe's unification after the war has come into stage.
The Euro crisis has officially killed Europe's project.
Everywhere in the EU, parties who are hostile to the EU or wish to throw the euro over board as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptical Party could set up the alternative for Germany – only this year – for a number of more than five million votes at the Federal Day election in September and thus effectively disperse the free Democrats (equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There has always been domestic opposition against the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Because of the strict savings policy committed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is required by maintaining the common currency, many people believe that the project of Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the cause of excessive budget deficits to national governments – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has established its members on exchange courses that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, Southern Europe is recovered with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
Behind the current etat and monetary problems, a deeper European productivity problem lies.
As a result of the 'Green' Energy Directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidie of French and German energy companies at consumer costs – the European industry pays the double for electricity and four times for gas compared with the United States.
This is a shameful cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
The European petrochemical industry does not protect all wage fixations in the world from being pushed into the corner of cheap American gas.
As a result, a revolution draws up, especially in France, the EU's single cheerleader.
After the war, the political elites of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be held in chess and Paris lifted up at the height of Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gate for political legitimacy and has pressed Europe on its own economic policy, with which the affected French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen's legally judged, EU hostile Front National has just won a decisive re-election and thus refers to the prevailing socialists.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a splitting in the right spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to create an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are well cut off in these elections – and that is very well possible – then this block could for the first time dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point on which I want to go on: in the future, the rising return to the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) nations' which General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distinguish itself from this project in the hope of smileing into the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific area indicates that Britain will be in the Atlantic rain alone.
Where's Scotland staying with all that?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including to tell Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suppose that Scotland could be very good in a looser European association if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unborn Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider to make it equal to Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – noteworthy – the most successful political movement against savings policy in Europe and has gained a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the refusal of the proposed (and made) reductions that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the following Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to respond to.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for an independence only to be forced from Berlin and Brussels to get a savings policy.
Early puberty: grow faster
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white age genocides, as research shows.
Body changes have not yet meant puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the epidemic fattyness is a trigger of early puberty
The trend to early puberty is less marked in boys
The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and shame hair already at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming parents – normally this is no sign of the rapid introduction of puberty,” explained Kaplowitz.
Apparent advertisements of development, such as growing breasts, shame and axis hair, as well as body smoking, appear in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there was only a slightly shift in the age of menarche (event of first regular bleeding) over the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years to the Menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Frühe Puberty in Girls: The essential adviser for dealing with this common problem".
Time is the exactest test as puberty is going ahead.
It is controversial, which actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it is the case with “predice” when the breast-growing is accompanied by a growth shift eight years ago.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a child doctor can monitor carefully.
In the case of faster advances, tests may be shown by an enticronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and preventing another consequence: the premature ageing of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is refraining from medicines, but he admits: “The oppression of puberty can reduce behavioural problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their ages."
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had got her days with ten.
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came scared and excited from school home because she was the first in her friendship.
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no clear evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are essential.
Boys come to puberty like girls before.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing prediction is the epidemic of fattyness.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, making a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that have played a role.
In this country, African and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white older women.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to be an early puberty of all possible things, from economic conditions across the climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys have already grown face and shame hair earlier, the trend to a totally premature puberty is not as profound as for girls.
Other doctors at the AAP Conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and shamhaar is widespread even in babies and infants.
“We must be careful to identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their child doctor how to talk to their child.
“This may mean that you have to conduct a conversation earlier than expected,” said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who flow early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if he enters earlier than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers struggle in the face of large orders on seat width
Between the leading aircraft manufacturers, it has come to a dispute about the width of seats in the tourist class at long-distance flights, which indicates the sound for a bitter collapse on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The struggle is about the seat width, which passengers are offered during long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most striving to airlines, but this designated space represents the key to the efficiency claims in the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus demanded this week a industry standard which requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US-American Archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers bet to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-distance flights and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the plane is designed – in particular whether there are series with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the economic results specified to provide the new “Mini Jumbo” design.
Boeing claims that his modernised “777X” fascinates 406 persons in seats in the tourist class, which are more than 17 inches wide and allow 10 per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 persons in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aeroplane giggers often distribute Hiebe on technical details via advertising in the special press.
Now Airbus appeals directly to the public before Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to run with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed money providers a picture in which three people are sitting together in a restaurant, and the title “Would you accept this?”
“Boeing suggests long-distance flights in seats closer to regional turbo props”, says Airbus sales manager John Leahy.
Given changes in dietary habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s when the Boeing 747 defined the modern longitudinal journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American has increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the US Ministry of Health.
According to US health statistics, the number of male average Americans in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival holds a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the freshly baptized “Jet Set” was narrower.
Airbus carried out studies that demonstrated that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing contests the numbers of Airbus on the seat sizes and says that it is not in the measure of the manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between flight tariffs and devices.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
“It really goes beyond giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe to be successful”, explains Kent Craver from Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate what makes it profitable.
You know her business better than anyone else.
In the case of passengers, it is more eelbow freedom, but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly a topic that can affect transactions.
Following the conflict, a race for flight orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars by list prices in the coming decades, which could have a sustainable impact on the export balance of the United States or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute about the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-motor long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitting Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boeings on the results are partly dependent on comparing the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than those used in currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing therefore quets more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products”, says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s pointed out that many passengers decided for the closer order, which could be associated with cheaper flight tariffs.
“Achten inches of seating would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert for cabine establishment, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world travelling jet sellers even have a band size in order to measure the establishment in competition.
Even if they commend comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-proof design for cheap flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers a A350 with ten-sitting series, but has not sold any yet, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats for some jets at the gangs.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation is likely to be dumped according to a new industry standard, but could deduce from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may make pleasure in smoking garaus
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotin vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking.
One single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine suspicion for a life.
Before tests on humans, further experiments are needed, which may last a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying to try all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine suspicion is stronger than these approaches”, said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified in such a way that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a continuous current of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thus not inventing nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice administered to nicotin maintained their normal level of activity.
Muses without vaccination, however, had taken a “outtime”, the researchers explained that the nicotin had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and unpractical.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower because it transforms liver cells into antibodies factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if he is absolutely sure that children are given before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine suction.
But more likely smokers would use him to stop.
“They know, when they start smoking again, they feel no more pleasure because of the nicotin vaccine, and that helps them to dispose of the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was necessary.
Tripodi contests to be influenced by Obeid
Against the former laboratory-party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a investigation is initiated by the state corruption authority.
The former NSW minister objects to having changed the arrangements for marijuana poughing on request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden shares in three lands in Stately controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations on whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of State, extending contracts at the Circular Quay, where the obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without an invitation to tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi was aware of obeid's hidden interest in the lands after Tripodis' former vice-general officer Lynne Ashpole had declared the same thing on Thursday.
In years of discussions that began in 2005, the government had pressed on public tenders for the pact contracts.
The parishes were opposed and wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, which imported the obeids 2.5 million dollars annually, were extended without a public invitation to tender.
Tripodi, who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken for public tenders.
However, he refuses to make changes to Obeid's requests, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had pressed on a transformation of the government's pact schemes.
One of the ICAC's telephone records showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading official who had changed to the port department after working under Obeid in the fisheries authority.
"Was the subject discussed in these telephone discussions the preparation of commercial discharge schemes?" asked Vice-President Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what has been discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighting aircraft attack targets in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a goal in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday, a leading government staff confirmed Fox News.
The official did not explain what the goal was, but said that it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out airships on rocket deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-Visa could be undertaken 'reality tests'
In the framework of advanced measures, the government considers a "reality test" for foreign workers with 457 visum.
If the test was introduced, it would be using a criterion to prevent 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door for the entrance of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a discussion proposal was published by the government after the former member of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be taken as offensive by Australia's neighbours.
“Superior statements such as ‘Americans are going to work at the back’ and ‘First of Australia’ are a very unpleasant fall in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market”, she said to the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, that was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region embrace an echo of this historical artefact, that would not surprise me.
The discussion proposal covers twelve measures once proposed by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was based yesterday on discussions on human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, others are still considered.
If the authenticity criterion is accepted, then a person who requests a visa may be verified as to whether ‘the application is true in the cases where the applicant is related to the holder or to a relevant person of the supporting company’.
In addition, companies could be obliged to pay account of the number of 457-visum owners after in the past, companies who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally suspended hundreds.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old Sri-Lanish asylum, probably died of a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The disrupted nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The British Government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and northern England at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister for Transport, Baroness Kramer said that the project “will bring closer to the UK”.
The Scottish Minister for Transport, Keith Brown, explained that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and West Midlands.
After grade 2 is completed, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost for the construction of the high speed road between London and North England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, who is in conversation with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to search for further route capacities and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip of at last three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings the UK and its cities closer together.”
We go forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish State Secretary, Alistair Carmichael, commented: “The announcement today is a good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael urged to use “indispensable” for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection offers the potential of enormous economic advantages for Scotland, but at the same time the economic force of Scotland also provides a argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK."
That is why we are pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, which creates advantages for all and complements the link Glasgow-Edinburgh that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I am looking forward to examining the investigation report with the British Ministers next year and taking the next steps together.
Provisions for electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must also continue to disable tablets and smartphones at start and landing, despite efforts in the United States to relieve the arrangements for such devices.
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read, see or play e-books during critical flight phases, provided they are in "air mode".
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed this, but many people find it angry that they may not read their e-books at the start and landing.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the US-American airlines, but do not follow any direct plans to modify their rules.
The CASA also stated that the notification would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
‘The CASA currently has no specific regulations concerning the use of electronic devices in the aircraft’, has been proclaimed.
The topic is covered by provisions which, according to airlines, have to maintain safety at any time and follow the safety instructions provided by the cabin staff.
Virgin has already conducted discussions with the CASA on an extension of his Wi-Fi maintenance system on flights and explains that it is open to change, but it must be initiated by the lawgiver.
“We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer (throughless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas explained that you will remain in the current regulations until further.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices should not be used at the start and landing time, and we do not currently have any plans to change that," explained the company.
The FAA regulations apply to US-American airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations which passengers can benefit from, and will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons for that.
The decision is different in US-American societies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, handbag programs and customer instructions.
“After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, a airline can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones in every height”, the FAA announced.
In rare cases in bad sight, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavyer devices, when starting and landing, stay safely under the seat or in the facks over the seats.
In front of the district village against Schalke, fellow BVB trailers with luminous rockets had taken care of horrible scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Football League against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost already spensical acoustic, which offered to the viewer until shortly before the appeal of the Bundesligaspiel between the German Vice-President Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
To hear most of the guest fans were with their songs.
The south tribunal, on the other hand, where the faithfulst of the faithful - and loudest - BVB-Fans stand, first presented exceptionally silent: no songs, no battle calls.
The podest of the Capo, who otherwise coordinates the joint adhesive, remained unresponsive.
And in front of the tribunal, a large flag with the title "Department ban".
Only as the gatekeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always the first BVB player entered the place, burned up a short-term joy.
When his teammates followed, there were loud songs and wound shafts - but long not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribun, nothing was right.
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for celebrations.
Only five minutes before the capo climbed his podest - and the up to then just gripping tension evolved in a loud cry when Dickel as usual asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
When the last was like always the south tribune in the row - and finally was here again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loudly call "Thebysier stands up" came with the tip of the south tribunal, it was again as always.
The silence before may have been a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the accompanying BVB trailers had fired light rackets into the spectators and on the spot - and thereby almost gate guards Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was swept late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and you believe whatzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive intersections for the entire Ultra movement," announced the BVB boss on Thursday night on a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I have forbidden that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy in pyrotechnology matters.
In addition, the Ultra's various means of punishment have been shown - until Tuesday, they have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, as Watzke says, the BVB will set a sanction by the end of the next week.
"This will be cutting in," insured Watzke.
It must be excited how the reactions on the south tribunal will come out then.
Pfandhouses trees in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
In a pants house in the shopping centre of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalea exchanges a golden armband, a ring and a couple of ear rings to pay the school fees of their daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirthalea.
Although she deserves 3,000 Singapore dollars each month (approximately EUR 1,730) as a administrative co-worker and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not rich, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of the households increases – is so large that ValueMax, where she has done her exchange, this week became the third pfand house listed on the syngapurian stock.
Arrangement of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalea, but also almost as favourable as an unsafe bank loan.
Typically, pfand houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest of 17 percent, which is only nearly more than 15.4 per cent required by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pfand houses offer the advantage that there is no need for a review of creditworthiness or income evidence, which is why loans are more rapidly possible than in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to pants after families feel the pressure of increasing living costs and increasing budget and consumer debt.
After five years of steady growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a looser financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with smaller and medium-sized income are looking for pand houses to compensate the difference in the steady economy.
This week the rating agency referred to Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly by increasing hypocrisy, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
The Agency estimates that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent still in 2008.
People's economies are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which this week has almost come out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a resignation of consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that, in the light of increasing costs, people in the medium to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, Economy at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highest levels of gold prices in the last two years have increased the trend to the conservation of personal items, since people use the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the carved items are in the 200 pfand houses of the city state of Gold.
People say: "The gold price looks good, let's cook our grandmother's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20-percent customer growth in his branches in recent months.
The growth in the pfand business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, intends not only to expand to the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yes Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances the 60 percent of the 66 million Singapur dollar, which took it this week with the stocking in Singapore.
While some creditors were in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yes explains that pfand houses are not only finer than other borrowers but also did not directly increase the debts.
'Cundes borrow items which they already possess, and the floating personal value does not increase the budgetary allowance' she explains.
The pfand leasing business is increasingly accepted in society as a short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pfand leasing are in financial difficulties.
Abundant people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to occupy gold bars and rollex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
Customers from every social layer come to us.
“This includes wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small enterprises that need to break over the cash flow,” says Yes.
Sometimes they just need money very fast.
NSA sauces data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service desk Edward Snowden has a principle of interest in helping Germany in clarifying the ever more brisant NSA seafarer.
According to the Greenen-Bundestag-Abgeordnete Hans-Christian Stöbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-Home Service staff would announce at a German lawyer or before an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said Stöbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Salvation package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian Government is in line with the hard conditions that are linked to the rescue package of more than $325 million for the Tasmanian health sector in order to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, announced that Commonwealth would take “inferior measures” to prevent a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island State, a higher quota for chronic diseases and system restrictions.
Financing for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has cut down a emergency rescue package that we believe is addressing the unique challenges the state faces," said Plibersek today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars instant assistance for election services.
By further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to grey stars, residues should be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care after stationary stays, specialist education, psychological health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“This investment corresponds to the ideas of the hospital staff concerned told me that they were the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister was on a strict reporting and accounting obligation of the Tasmanian Government.
The state had to maintain the current level of financing to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-fold Commission is set up and aims to ensure that the state provides health services as effective and efficient as possible.
As Wilkie today explained, the $325 million would only benefit little if “they were not accompanied by genuine reforms that would bring the public-Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I am confident that federal aids will contribute greatly to taking the state’s public health system from the concern list,” said Wilkie.
According to the government of the State, these electoral services will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
However, the health policy speaker of opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, is of the view that today's announcement is only a "please solution".
“We are in the present situation because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government almost rip a half billion dollars out of the system and puts the Commonwealth 300 million in and then do as if it's the good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package will be issued for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' Adaptation of the Roman of Denis Diderot convinced with extraordinary production equipment and contemporary details, however, is also harder cost than needed.
The action played in France in the 1760s tells the dramatic story of Suzanne, a young adorn who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is faced with the extreme cruelness of an extremely sadistic upper lady and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never gleams in looseness or sensation – and it lies in its problem.
The celebrational seriousness with which the film is told also makes it to the audience as a piercing shirt.
Syria has destroyed his ability to produce chemical weapons, so a surveillance group
Syria destroyed important organs for the manufacture of chemical weapons and guitar gas munition, explained the global surveillance group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were severe collapses close to one of the locations where toxic substances are stored.
Similarly, on Thursday a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war soon three years ago.
The announcement of the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on
1 November, which was set by the Hague organisation of Damascus to destroy or “inoperable” all the devices for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machines for the mixing of chemicals into poisonous gas and the filling of ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which in general represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule aimed at destroying all the chemical weapons of Syria by mid 2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has still to start destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including Senfgas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when on Thursday fights took place in the city of Safira, the experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities here, as the Syrian human rights observation centre in Britain announced.
The activist group, who persecuted the number of dead by a network of activists in Syria, explained that 120,296 people died on Thursday.
Of which are 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Libanese hisbollah miles.
Also among the dead are 2.202 deserted army soldiers and 5.375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated until now.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape from the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting against the rebels for weeks in Safira, many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention details.
The fights underline the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a huge civil war.
According to the OPCW, who is closely cooperating with the United Nations, the team “is not convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned in Syria and has experienced their destruction.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of the checks and visited 21 of the 23 places specified by Damascus.
The inspectors said that because of security concerns, the visit of two institutions had not been possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites were “released ... and the existing objects of the Chemical Arms Programme were transferred to other listed facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee.
"I draw the hat from the braveness and courage that you have all shown in the performance of the most challenging mission ever performed by this organization," explained Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Monitoring Organization in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the primarily Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have struggled against Assad's government and their security forces, many members of the Alawits, a division of Shiitic Islam.
Concerning further developments, Rami Abdurrahman said that there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Angry on Judgment for bombers of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had died in 2002 in the bomb attack in Bali reacted indignantly about the judgment of the last instigators who were put before court, as Umar Patek believes that they should be dismissed by law.
Patek, who was on the flight of nearly ten years as one of the most visited people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence yesterday for his role in the construction of explosive bodies for the bomb attack.
He could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
There was also a guilt in a number of terrorist-related accusations, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia to sanctuary in 2000.
The state prosecutor had called for a lifelong penalty, even if it could have claimed the death penalty for the man who, because of his reputation, was also called "demolition Man" for the man.
The decision has awakened painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin-old Jane and Jenny in the destruction that Patek and his co-dependents caused nearly ten years ago.
With tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
Corteen said to AAP: "You should put him in front of a shooting command."
I have to live every day with that I won't get any other grandchildren and I'll never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was similar to the ground, when on 12 October 2002 a huge bomb exploded in a small load that had been parked before the nightclub shortly after 23 o'clock.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide attacker had an exploded backpack filled with explosive.
He fell into the coma for a month after the attack and “star” three times, while he was hanging on a lifekeeping system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbad and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
To let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
To get 20 years after he killed 202 people and many hundreds of injured, it's not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber who stood before court.
He retired almost a decade of arrest, but was finally in January 2011 in the Pakistanian city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden nearly four months later.
During the negotiation, a FBI agent said that secret service reports had provided evidence that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between South Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't sit down," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has caused to others.
The judgment came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which will be held in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: passengers are now able to use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not lead mobile conversations)
Flight travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, music and the appearance of movies, but not phone, so the new directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA co-worker Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Aeroplanes must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and have updated the training manuals of the air personnel as well as the arrangements for the conservation of equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA explained that it had already received plans from some airlines to enhance the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
These airlines also included Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could soon approve the extended use of electronic devices," the FAA announced in a pronunciation.
Passengers need to disable smartphones, tablets and other devices when the doors are closed.
You can start it again only if the plane has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives green light.
On entry into the landing flight, the passengers need to shut them down again and cannot start them again before the plane has arrived.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment at the start, landing and rolling field, the FAA explained.
Most new transport aircraft and other flights that have been refurbished for the use of Wi-Fi in larger heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Confederation of Professional Flyers, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it”, commented Glading.
We are honestly sorry to feel like overseers in this topic.
Nevertheless, Internet connections remained forbidden to surf, exchange of emails, text messages or download of data under three kilometres, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in the flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble similar online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to leave publicly a jet from American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the hill.
And more heavy equipment such as laptops must also continue to be stuck, as there is a danger of injury in case they fly through the cabin.
Mobile talks continue to be prohibited during the flight.
The regulatory competence for telephone conversations is not at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
FAA may prohibit certain electronic devices at start and landing
Last month Mark Rosenker said from the National Transportation Safety Board, security experts on national transport issues at CBS News, phones would still be considered as a risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disturbances in navigational devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also interfere with broadcasting agents”, said Rosenker.
A consulting committee of the industry, called up by the FAA to examine this topic, recommended last month that the government permits a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on the FAA has increased to reduce restrictions on use.
Criticals such as democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the equipment has become widespread.
In some studies, it is the case that up to a third of the passengers forgets or ignores the shutdown of the device.
In 1966, the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices were announced by passengers, UKW radios, which then represented the latest trend of technology.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interferences do not constitute them.
Airlines offer passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the flight height is reached.
The flights adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interferences.
The majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices according to the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally provide much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-Readers, for example, only deliver minimum radiation when you change.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Amason.com is one of the opponents of resolving the limitations for the use of equipment by passengers.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but no one could find.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believes that the disorder by the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only single reports of pilots who are speaking for a disruption of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the shutdown of the equipment by passengers when they landed under bad views.
A group of travelers welcomed the changes and referred to it as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would be extensively equipped with technology today.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released by air rescue service from North Sea-Bohrinsel
A bird flying to the coast by air rescue, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea Bohrinsel, was released again to the nature.
The waters were flew with a helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was popped up by the Scottish Animal Protection Organization SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “These waters were probably a winter train bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: "He couldn't go on on on the flight, so we were contacted with the request for help."
When they were released, the waters were fit and healthy.
Is Europe’s elite willing to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in Britain want to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov consulted over 1,000 leaders from the economy, which depicted in some UK sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while the EU states are stagniting.
They wish that new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil should be favoured by the government side rather than the long and effortful process to reform the obscure EU institutions.
The majority of the economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be withdrawn to Westminster, as they consider certain legally regulated topics – from cartel law to product legislation.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, since, according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels regulations would now be greater than the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40 percent of the large companies agreed to the most traditionally friendly of Europe.
Finally, and most likely, our question of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade does not depend on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in businesses of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pressing on a 'sensitive change' that brings the elevation of action back to the UK.
It is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion in favour of the remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the UK economy is behind its plan for the re-treatment of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that from a new negotiating, companies expect a significant shift in the forces back to the UK.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the euro area is moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Great Britain, as the result of our survey shows, which for companies means an increased attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller by Gazprom describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas line
The construction start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom board.
"The present event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has started," said Chairman of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, on Thursday.
The project is a key element for energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream aims to ensure greater diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A conflict between Gazprom and its pendants in Ukraine, where the majority of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk of conventional routes, as is officially heard.
Mr Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever".
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream to beneficiary prices when the entire project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries will begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, no way passes to the real estate site Germany.
The economic framework data are voted and the funding options are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the Börsen newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from economic strength and the good economic conditions in European comparison in the country.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, the Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle pointed out the 9th day of the stock exchange newspaper.
As searched for German commercial immobilies, the view of the transaction volume is shown, so Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the Plus was only 6%, in France at 19%.
"Indoor investments offer an attractive interest," said Ulbrich.
The remuneration distance between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual defects
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual abuse in relation to children before 2011 contemplating the child career Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children learned.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that “the organisation never had to deal with a incident of sexual abuse of children”.
Managing director Phillip Hare was inquired of a case where a YMCA co-worker was accused of child pornography and another one where a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been condemned because of the abuse of his trusted children.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second.
He admitted that the opening declaration of the YMCA to the Commission had also been incompatible with the claim that “the YMCA had given external checks in which the YMCA was recognised as at the front at child safety".
In fact, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-sized assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Training Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started at 21 at YMCA, admitted that the management has failed "from me down" in the position of Lord and does not ensure that employees have been clear about their obligations to report breaches of the directives on child security.
Lord had been sentenced to the YMCA during his two-year activity for sexual abuse in the beginning of the year.
He was sentenced to at least six years of prison.
Hare, however, says that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented the employees from reporting Lord's infringements in relation to the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed infringements, including that Lord was alone with children, privately cared for her as a babysitter, left her sitting on his gun, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose commander was Lord and who had asked for a training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service director Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior Lords in YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very unnecessary”.
The manager stated that he would not accept the statements of employees that they would not have trusted to report to their supervisor.
Rather, he said, her friendship with Lord had affected her judgment, so they had not reported him.
Hare explained that he had informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organisation had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord Interval" was "not reporting" by employees, and the board agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to impose the staff to sign secretary obligations shortly after the infringements had been taken by the manager of the YMCA children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but what was "expressive" and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children during the period between 2009 and 2011 when Jonathan Lord was busy, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, expert on sexual abuse of children, explained to the Commission.
He explained that there have been “earliest problems” in setting up, verifying, working, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was held until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the chance of return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight at the fifth anniversary of his retirement from the Office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various internal issues.
Since his retirement in June 2007, after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided expressing himself to British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to the foreign policy and its role as a messenger of the Quartet of Peacestifters in the Middle East.
On the question if he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted from the Evening Standard from London with the words: “Yes, surely, but it is unlikely that this happens, so...”
When the horse show experts found themselves in the army in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year, they realized that a hard competition was at stake.
However, no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Churchland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the children's garden and has taken its first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee slept through the three rounds and picked up the first price – with 30 adult opponents behind them.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior and styles in the annual competition, organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he appeared in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had set his plate mud up in a freak angle and led the two-year-old coffee through the ring.
Fenton was commended by the Jurors for his natural skills in handling the pony, which was far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift to his third birthday and since then practiced with the Shetland Pony every day.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and coffee are a great tension."
They had to approach the whole participant field and went away with goldpokal and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the Arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: “The whole audience was as electricized and everyone cast it on and dressed it.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the Arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy of animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
As he is started, it will not take long until he is on the “Perd of the Year” shade – and I am sure he will cut off well.
A speaker of the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they're a great team.
The Jurors assessed Fenton and Toffee afterwards how well they had hit themselves and presented themselves in the presentation ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes have contributed their part to this, which really fitted perfectly for the occasion.
The Chinese newspaper should be ‘reformed’ after a call
A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been accused of diffusion, was to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The new Express in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later confessed on television that he had accepted money to counterfeit reports about a national company.
The new express is now being subject to a "total rectification", explained the regulatory authority.
The 'Rectification Order' was received by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the new Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports about the stock-noted company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was unordered,” the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it was decided to “appear a administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter license to him”.
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a complete rectification of the New Express and to recommend that the relevant controllers be determined at the New Express and immediately verify the leadership team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported some claimed financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the cover and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen came up in the public television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the whole news industry and their ability to gain the confidence of the public”, he explained to the state news sender CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out of money and glory.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the cover and explained that it was not possible to verify the reports correctly.
In recent times, various known suspects have dismissed television confessions.
Experts say that admissions are still routinely forced, despite a change in law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned to force someone to accuse themselves.
Drug Tunnel discovered with its own railway between the United States and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for the drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical train operation, was now discovered.
The U.S. authorities describe the 120 times 90 centimeter measurement tunnel as one of the most defective passports they've ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of almost six football fields, connects camp halls near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless inevitable warehouses that make it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognised, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, according to the records of the court.
Three men who, according to the authorities' statement, worked as drivers were accused of the possession and intended sales of Marihuana and cocaine.
They are threatening prison sentences between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are putting on an extensive underground network of dishwasher channels.
The tunnel is the eighth big passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels have been discovered after the Marihuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which poses the drug cartels the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 metres long passage with rails, which moved from a kitchen in a living house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves
Actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has expressed himself to separate his wife, Miranda Kerr's top model.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which should be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life does not sometimes go exactly as we plan or hope it".
Kerr and he still loved himself, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
According to Lexica, Veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it differs in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of sahnetorte, ice or a strong edamer, these muds are not on the menu of a veganer.
Milk, cheese, egg, besides the absence of meat and fish, the veganer leaves away from all the consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, you may ask yourself, but when you consider it, the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable entrance.
"Bred-ups are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for Veganer.
Reuben Proctor also welcomes visiting the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years the born New Zealands have lived vegan, in Lampertheim he (fast) finds everything he needs for life. "In 1997 I transformed my diet and became vegetarian."
At the turn of the century the next step took place and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, the art leather prefers normal leather.
He realized that it is also in other everyday interests without animal products.
First of all, vegan is a ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," proctor says the maximum of the Vegans that extends to the entire consumption behaviour.
Instead of trusting citizens, roasters or rubber bears, the Veganer quickly discovered very new products, which grew enthusiasm.
"It is a double bonus," says Proctor today, "in fact, vegan is not a failure, it is not an enrichment." The assumption that you reduce the choice of food options, proctor is rather the power of the habit.
And precisely these conditions also allowed some to fail so well-membered attempts.
"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," proctor compares a comparison.
And turn: "Certain tastes are not to be fixed on the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that is the taste.
"You can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
For example, Proctor brings Aubergines, Champigons and a few vegan spices to a barbecue festival.
It takes care of a balanced, varying diet, which is intended to taste it very well once.
Of course you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, the transformation had a positive aspect.
I don't take a foreign cholesterol and have an increase in vitamins.
There are high-performance atletes that only feed vegan.
"My blood values are best, I'm often going to be checked," explains Proctor.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Because animals are feeded with feedingstuffs, instead of grassing on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 proportion is high," says Proctor.
There is also the possibility for Veganer to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are all right," he explains.
Proctor must not go far for food purchase.
Finally, there are basic nutrients everywhere, and every supermarket now has soja milk and other products.
I'll find everything I need in place.
Just sometimes I'm buying something special.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but so it is known to be true of "normal" finished products."
Without preparation of vegan courts would be far more favourable and less timely than generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is much to discover, with a few little knifes you can achieve good if not partly better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, somewhat more back powder and carbon acid instead of eggs, with its vegan cheese, Proctor was also able to bring his swear parents to awe.
Familiar festivals give the Veganer a new cube.
This has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new job value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as people themselves," says Proctor.
But of course, he was already brought up with skepsis.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Shall I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - You have to act as a veganer with fingertips.
"I don't reject the people, I am part of this society," Proctor wouldn't want to take an enklavendasin.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not appear as veganous as suspected - and the veganer does not seem as restricted in everyday life as generally accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many dancer shops offer flags, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates on pasta courts, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are so slow.
"When I started to feed me vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealand can find out a development: "You have to talk to the people to pay attention to it".
"If enough demands come, they may tend to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the combush in Mannheim or the café bird free.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan court on the menu.
In general, vegan courts are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat it, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes are, however, exclusive, in the most true sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the most part of the front impossible," says Proctor.
But at the beginning, the purchase of vegan products could be a little difficult.
Especially when you learn to understand which can also contain animal additives in earth nuts as colormakers, you seem to be quick to leave your courage, following the ethics in so many obstacles and falls.
Not only that is why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients, which are added to food but also cleansing.
"After and afterwards, you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to watch "It's sometimes better to do small steps than to stand or to stumble," knows Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes consciousness.
Perhaps he does not make it completely possible to distract his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to criticize his habits.
The stock operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
Trade at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other 11 US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhinderedly.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the stock operator.
Only on Tuesday the indexes of Nasdaq had not been calculated for one hour because of errors in the data transport.
In August this year there had been two pans alone in a week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent massive malicious purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
After that, the stock operators needed almost a whole day to review and stretch the orders.
Two days later, half of the whole share trade in the United States came to reach for several hours because of a computer pane on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
In addition, over the last year of Facebook's stocking.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sales orders, later the stock supervision of SEC established and distorted the company into a record penalty of $10 million.
Constance: Wheelers drive 63-year-olds around
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday night, at 22 o'clock, with a women's bike on the left walk from the railway station toward the market site was on the way.
Suddenly, when a 63 - year - old man came on the road from a local, the bicycle driver was unable to brake in time according to the police.
At the following collapse, the walker was pressed against the wall of the house, went further to the ground and drew a 15 centimeter long place wound on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured to the clinicum for medical treatment.
British Police makes Assange a delivery order
Today, the British police have delivered a delivery decision to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought refuge in the ecuadorian Embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian had a 'invitation to take place', which invited him to appear in a police guard, and added, he should not comply with it, threatening him to arrest.
Assange threatens the delivery to Sweden because of the accusation in a sexual delict after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court has rejected its objection to the delivery of the first month.
As he fears that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecudorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “submitted to a 40-year-old man to join a police guard at one of us,” said one speaker.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on insurance.
The message did not comment on the posting of the police call.
Assange fears he was delivered to the United States by Sweden and accused there for possible spy proposals after he published over 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks' delight website.
The driver, which was rushed with 210 km/h and hot drinks between the legs, receives 1,000 £ penalty
A driver was penalized with a penalty of £1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree.
After the police arrested him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester Office Court, Howie became guilty without having taken the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay the cost of £90 and a sacrifice of £100.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's Speculation Blase
The Ministry of Finance has temporarily calculated the CGT measure, but still wait for the final decision of treasure Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had charged a stamp tax of 7% on apartments costing more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals.
Already, the revenues from the stamp tax on residence in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 tax year, were collected for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in the tax on high-priced housing and the introduction of the related legislation against treatment, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is too low taxed, regardless of the effects of the obsolete municipal tax system.”
"But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained in terms of the purchase of real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling them," he added.
First-class real estates – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the prosperous southwest belt of London, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, have consumed the record value of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed an even annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by a rising domestic market, where the southwest part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, such as a study of Savills.
Scientists were able to throw more light on the context of a dog’s sweating with his mood.
Earlier research had shown that happy dogs with the tail went more to the right (from the dog's view), while it was the left side for nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can see these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurologist at Trient University, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right brain half respond differently to Stimuli, which causes positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as with humans, the right brain half is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs reacted to the sidewidths of their species, the researchers monitored the animals while these movies looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analysed the behaviour.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves into the one, once in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate dismissing other aspects, and thus we have been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw the other unexpressed dog moving the tail to the right (from the perspective of the wedding dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the slope was primarily left (againing from the perspective of the dog that weighed), their heart rate increased, and they looked uncomfortable.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience, the movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said: “If you have different meetings with other dogs and wedding with the tail is more linked to friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, you will respond on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the insights of dog owners, veterinarians and trainers could help to improve understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog housing and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study in which it was examined whether the links and the right is important for dogs.
Last year, a team of Lincoln University discovered that dogs rotate their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was said: “Hounds go to a robot dog when his ‘schwanz’ weighed left and not right, instead of being uncomfortable – just different from in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore touch that in the various studies, the dogs did not interpret the animals in the films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“There are significant evidence for many different mammals that the two halfs of the brain are used for different purposes, but many of the details have to be determined – and dogs do not constitute an exception,” says Bradshaw.
However, since their behavior is simply to be recorded, it will probably not take a long time until we understand why the tail sometimes moves into the one, sometimes in the other direction.

The Rockband Arctic Monkeys has moved a appearance into Glasgow after their lead singer has been ill of throat inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play in Hydro on Friday.

The announcement of the band came after she had to move a show in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys announced: “After the decision to cancel the show in the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and at medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys also have to cancel the show in Hydro in Glasgow on Friday 1 November."
"At Alex Turner, a throat inflammation was diagnosed, so he is unfortunately unable to occur."
The show in the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, which was posted in the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21th.
All tickets reserve validity for these shows.

Pope Franziskus appointed the first cardinals in February
Pope Franziskus was first called new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergymen in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also those who choose a Pope, so that Franziskus will appointed the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached a 80-year-old can no longer participate in the Pope election – which is the case with a group of 120 “developed cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony was held for the appointment of the new cardinals, which was also known as a consistory.
“Papst Franziskus decided to announce his decision to call the Consistorium in February in advance, so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of elective cardinals would probably have decreased until February.
He explained that a pope normally designated as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of elective cardinals again cover 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Consistorium next year is therefore important because it was the first since the election of Franziskus in March this year, says Valero.
At present there is a certain overlap on the sides of Europe, and in particular in Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he said.
Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first ones who have been appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Franziskus, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who have the order to find opportunities for reforming the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Franziskus has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it is “this possible” that Franziskus asks the cardinals for advice.
But so far we weren't in this position – that's all new.
Valero said that, typically, the bishops from large places would call to cardinals, but Franziskus sting “full of surprises – so we don't know who he is designating”.
GM calls new pickup trucks in the USA back to repair the seat lease
General Motors calls back nearly 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup drucks with construction year 2014 in order to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat lease, so a communication from the US regulatory authority for vehicle safety on Friday.
For some of the cars, there can be a defect in the mechanism for restoring the front lease.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety in the case of head support.
“When driving up from the back to the vehicle, it is possible that the head support does not protect the insassesses properly, so there is an increased risk of injury” was read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The models returned were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of the GM-Trucks started in June and represents the main model start of the leading US-American auto manufacturer since the insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the vehicle in the first October half of the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to examine the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdowns, which had negative effects on car sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra-Trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, had risen by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM explained on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra Pickup drucks.
The GM share increased by 1.4 per cent at the New York Stock Exchange to 37.47 US dollars on Friday afternoon.
Destroying a Obama selector
I voted for President Obama twice in the hope that change would be possible.
He says that Obama has made praiseful efforts undertaken by the blockade tactics of the Republicans.
The blockade policy does not apologize for the website problems of Obamacare, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election struggle were a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I'm reading a terrible sad book right now.
It is a book that I believed it would bring me up during the stupid second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called “The Audacity to Win” and paints the memoirs of Barack Obamas for the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient necross in the evening and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when politics were inspired by millions of inspired and a speaker could breathe.
The election was a crushed victory and news speaker held in order to keep the historical significance of this hour in mind.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
On the date, Obama changed to the office in 2008, he had a 82% consent value.
And then I'll close the book.
Turning back to the present is a bad wake up as if you were to get rid of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missing opportunities.
In the years, since I gave my vote for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could've imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced violation of homosexuality in the army and the killing Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the party-political blockade tactics have cracked too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to mention only some.
But after many times I defended the Obama government against colleagues and acquaintances, I was at the end with my explanation attempts.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to listen to foreign heads or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished, which opens up governmental misconducts.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, has been murdered without procedural procedures, and why the public funding and expenditure limits will be dealt with during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, in which it says that the efforts of the White House to calm the media are the 'the most aggressive ... since the Nixon Government'.
And in recent times it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if this is what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Apparently, the Bureau is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown Massaker have the public discussion.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that's most disturbing me.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidate.
My Romney represented a confusing and unresolved alternative, he seemed not to be able to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression, a second term of office for Obama, free of pressure for future elections, would fulfil the hope we had heard of so long.
But with the reduction of the consent values for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become so harder.
It awakens in me the desire for the many promises that have resolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book describes how Obama had to sign a serious loss to Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they had to come back to course and follow their purpose.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the parental leave
The Milliardary and Member Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters become pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnet, which is in a judicial dispute about the payment of 6 million dollars of CO2 taxes, claimed that when he wanted to intervene questions from the table if he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave, because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she receives vacation," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, Palmer's election commission, with 53 votes, officially announced the successor of the Sunshine Coast Site of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the process for voting, so that it can go faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which data is entered into a computer immediately and then have the result at 6:30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of lead pins when marking the voting note.
Do you use it because you can then erase the results if they don't like you?
Nowadays, coordination with leadstones is incredible.
The Election Commission has examined the options for electronic elections and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy is an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office "very seriously".
A public office covers the public service.
“We are looking for no reward except that of history, that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspends two traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their foreign exchange department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation of the suspected manipulations on the monetary market is rapidly taking up.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they work together with the authorities in the world's largest financial market, on which 5,3 billion US dollars per day change ownership.
The two traders were the first RBS employees who were suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal draws around the libor interbanking business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed that it had received information requests from the authorities this month.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we fully cooperate with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation of closer persons indicated that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and Instant Messages sent from and to an earlier dealer to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and has now been admitted by his current position as European leader of the Forex spot trade at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was admitted this week and Matt Gardiner, former leader of monetary dealers at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at standard chartered.
No one of these traders was rejected any misconduct.
The Instant Message Group of Usher belonged to bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation nearby.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory authority had declared Finma to investigate a suspected manipulation of the exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Justice Ministry and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with suggestions that bankers should have agreed on transactions on the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said familiar with the situation.
Banks come through Instant Messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has put dealers in a range of upheaval, which has been one of the most profitable trade units of investment banks in recent years, but was under pressure this year because low volatility in currency limits the chances of speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the business and said it was almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and high-grade liquid exchange market, but leading dealers believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume of the exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to “the market can be influenced with very low ticket prices”.
The message came out the same day when credit Suisse announced that she had announced this week to a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds Office after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars last year.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is reduced,” explained Credit Suisse.
Painted on the Bechtle foundation
A group of the citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has refined the building on the Bechtle-Grundstück at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the footway, says a press release.
The planned coverage of the decaying house in the back of the property was not allowed for safety reasons because the ground threatens to rip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had rejected the rewarding action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparency with the message "We have been able to do so" had been applied.
However, the about 20 members of the citizens' initiative were little disturbed in their action.
Her motto on the large plate was called "We are against Bauruines".
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss grass - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passengers before the "building site" it was clear that some citizens believe that it will be much better with the completion of the city's project, although not few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city further delays these answers, it says from the sides of the BI.
As was heard, the public statements of the mayor also have effect.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he had said that he was afraid of the Thermalbad, the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss grass.
Thus, some seem just too scared, others feel that they are a "plump of pressure" in the population, says the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers.
Rangnick shelter for Shiris: Mane no swallow king
So pleased Ralf Rangnick with the current high-form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed was the sports director of the "Bullen" by the arbitrators.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the category of swallows," he took the two open wrists in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane on 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese was supposed to be an actor - which was obviously no, as the TV images showed.
"A crushed failure decision," said Rangnick, the arbitrator Harkam referred to as "voluntarily excessively".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Husten after the party.
His German landsman deputyed: "I would have acted as Roger Schmidt in every situation."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the scratchhole.
I don't know why.
"For I am the one who was offended," the 46-year-old emphasized.
However, in view of the success, Rangnick voted in favour of a commendation.
"There are only two words for that, right," he found.
There's not much to suspend.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on that way.
Cade change in winter transfer time will hardly exist.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Besides a player comes up with the wish that he wants to leave the club," said Rangnick.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the Obama Government: The U.S. Supreme Court decided today that the close health law associated with Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US-American citizens to complete or pay a sickness insurance until 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the State's tax authority.
The chief judge John Roberts joined the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages comprehensive law and also considered that the provision of the health law, which states should either extend the conditions for access to Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid claims, would not be indispensable.
The proceedings against the law had been struggled by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final exhibitor Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian örtchen have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunfall, the Rjukan located in the Westfjord valley usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors in 45 meters of height, a century dream was true on Wednesday.
"Endly!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the start ceremony in TV2.
Some valley residents recovered sunchairs, others set up safety glasses for sunglasses.
So far, sun hungry in the winter had to drive with a trail on a close summit.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the radiation with mirrors into the valley.
But this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council had finally adopted the 5 million crowns (approximately 615 000 euros).
A similar construction has been creating winter sunlight for a few years to the Italian Alpine place Viganella.
Post hardly empty Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sunday learning are still on different mail boxes of the core city and the parts of the city, but when you read the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find that the emptying of sun- and celebration days does not take place," the FDP informs.
A request from the FDP confirmed that.
On Sundays and celebrations only before the postal building in the Ernst-Ludwig Street 36 and in the Jakob-Müller Street 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether to learn in Hofheim and Rosengarten even Sunday, the answer to the FDP's request will not be answered.
The social and youth-political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to hack here.
The Sunday learning is an important postal service at the time of appointment.
"These are radical and indispensable to this business despite the price increase for letters on January 2013."
Thomas Bittner, Chairman of the Liberals' Group and City Association, supports his colleagues in the Group: "What is worried about me is the fact that the vacuum time is changed or also deleted here."
The post is far away from citizens nearby.
"In the least, the letters boxes in the districts of Neuschlott und Rosengarten must be renowned on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens need to be able to reach a briefcase with Sunday learning.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans to discuss this matter with the post.
Mayor Erich Maier answered that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, is also a Sunday learning in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken for privatisation.
"Then decisions are taken elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt's parking charges should increase strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The city's Magistrate advises this morning on a presentation of transport descendant Stefan Majer (Green).
Accordingly, the parking charges should be increased by 50 percent.
However, not to increase prices, but to reduce the period of parking clocks and parking license machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Assembly will still have to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt retail committee considers this "not a good idea".
The parking possibility directly before the business is "a non-underessable advantage for smaller traders".
The Transport Club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is "favourable and actually overly explicit".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Happy City: Fast Actions Overcome Hosts
With a narrow frame, the men I of the TSV of the Freudenstadt in the Schiller School Hall in Reutlingen had to approach the TG Gönningen from the Swiss Alb.
The apples stood on the other side with an experienced team.
But soon she did not, even olderly, fully cooperate with the rapid actions of the joy cities.
With the hard and occupied records, the gowns were extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz clean over the network center and were not at the place in the blocking.
Two high first phrases clearly expressed the superiority of the joyful cities in all interests.
In view of this challenging and decisive performance, the third sentence was then won a little lazy and desirable to the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2, the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to do well in Nagold, will stand a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were faced.
They delivered a hard-fighted two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides mainly caused errors and score gifts in the ball assumption; even in the passes, the precision was sometimes lack of goods and in some critical play scenes the excitement prevented the view of possible point gains.
However, in this highly balanced meeting, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto voted through the great physical use and a delightful commitment of both teams.
Maintenance day on the small English cottage
In the meantime, the Fifth Care Day, following the Natura 2000 project of the Upper Hotzenwald, a group of engaged participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the view of the tabernacle should be cut into the valley, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, so Emperor, described this area as the glossy piece of the slope, where the landscape offered the ideal framework for magnificent views.
He thanked the attendants for their willingness to cooperate and emphasized that the maintenance day was a suitable tool to strengthen the connection of humans and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time with the tourist aspect, the ecological consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Protection of the Presidency of Freiburg, following the greeting of Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the screen rule and wanted the action to be a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the wide view covers itself with the goal of maintaining the strongly grown old general area with its specific protected habitat types by opening and linking to the remaining pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterfly and grass jumpers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free connections to the conservation of species.
Tribukait said she wouldn't forget to break a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not merely indispensable to this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the chance of sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous supplement to the life project as well as the previous care days for the future.
Following these different statements, Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helpers in groups.
The larger trees had already been hit in the frontier, the forest trailer may be ready for calling.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of wactainer buses and of the maintenance of a dry stone lock.
The goal was the free sight at the point of view.
Running: Heads still one candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baartown Lopening with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future school, children, youth and senior policies, as well as its own urban works, has not yet reported a second mayor candidate.
As the only candidate for the success of the no-candidian Mayor Norbert Brugger, the 46-year-old bank buyer and operator Dieter Köpfer from Löfingen, has been established.
The application deadline expires on Monday, 11 November, at 18 o'clock.
Google, Samsung, Huawei accused of Nortel patients
On Thursday, the group of thousands of former Nortel-Patents stricted a lawn of complaints for patent infringement against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that was transferred by Nortel during the insolvency increase.
Rockstar, the consortium, which the Nortel patents bought for $4.5 billion, accused Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the community of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is notified in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents mean technology that brings search terms into line with relevant advertising on the Internet, so the complaint that thus meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google's operating system Android, which are in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google gave an initial order of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel paternate.
Google increased his offer several times and last offered 4,4 billion US dollars.
After the Nortel pattens of Rockstar had been overboated, Google Motorola Mobility purchased $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated part of Motorola's library to patents.
“Although Google failed with his attempt to acquire the patent at the auction, Google has injured the patents and continues to do so”, said the complainant.
Rockstar demands a high amount of damage from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is deliberate, so the accusation.
Egypt defeats first freely elected presidents
Mohammed Mursi departs the official time, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was detained as the first freely elected president of the country and thus the success of Husni Mubarak, who had been displaced 16 months earlier.
Mursi was also the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth Head of State since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He put the oath before the 18 in black robes dressed judges of the court, who have his seat at the Nile and have been reflected in an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," Mursi said at the celebration ceremony, which was transferred live in state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said the 60-year-old Mursi, an educated engineer and member of the Muslim brotherhood in the United States, a fundamentalist group, which has been mostly taken into vision since its establishment 84 years ago as a prohibited organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoi shortly after eleven o'clock.
Only a few hundred followers had been gathered before the court to celebrate the new president, and in contrast to the presidial prunk of the Mubarak time, traffic was only shortly stopped so that the autoconvoi could cross the normally lived road that connects the city centre with the southern premises.
As a hostage wheel of the brotherhood, his personal preacher has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, presenting himself not only as a candidate of Islamists, but all of those who wanted to target the efforts of the resurrection from 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egyptians are today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," explained Mursi dressed in a blue suit with red crab to the judges in the wooded chamber in which he departed the office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he should keep his attendance speech.
He was officially welcomed by a army chapel who played the National Hymne, which he listened to in a gardening position.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants in the largest hearing hall of the University with speaking hearings by “The Army and the people are a hand”.
The University of Cairo established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education in the 1970s has developed into a highburg Islamic student groups.
On Friday, Mursi made a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the rebellion leading last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he praised to demand presidial power powers that the military board had taken over by the Head of State of the Office.
However, with the delegating of the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he curses the will of the military, indicating that the battle of power will continue.
Mursis speaking on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populistic gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday evening, it says "Pump this party", on Saturday morning we continue with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed by leader: severely hurt
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed by a leader and hurts.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor at the outer facade of a guesthouse.
When he climbed on the heads on the roof, they kicked away, and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered severe injuries and was brought with the rescue shepherd "Christophorus 6" to the country hospital Salzburg.
Violent in South Africa: twice lifelong imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the offender was sentenced to twice life-long on Friday.
This was reported by the sender SABC.
The victim died later of the consequences of severe injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty in the beginning of the week of crime.
The act had caused disruption throughout the country.
The 21-year-old had rapped Anene Booysen in February in a industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought 14 hours for the survival of the victim, but for nothing.
The view of the youths was so devastating that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
During the process, Kana had admitted to be in a bar in the real night with Booysen.
He was also able to beat them and rape them, but he contested to be responsible for the death of the girl.
The police had initially gone out of several offenders, but two suspects were released from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecutor also emphasized during the procedure that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Violences in South Africa are almost a day-to-day: there are about 64,000 advertisements for sexual violence every year.
These are almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, they have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa appreciate the darkness in sexual violence, but at 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest Shinken
Jumbo looking for the "best shining of the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" the Pro7 star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker makes it clear at the beginning: The most important for the shining are the pigs, the turbomast is not a good condition.
Can shining that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, the chief of the large shining factory in the Black Forest, explains Jumbo's work of the "Adler" company in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite shining," as Jumbo announces to the black forests of Shinken.
Only with hair-proof and kettle he comes into the inside of the factory.
Jumbo also needs to disinfect his hands before he can take the micro.
Jumbo seen for strengthening at fastimbiss in forestshut
"Here I'm going to work red quantities," the television makers, black forests, shinks as a mass product.
16.000 cubits a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat share, color: Uli explains what it comes to quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered with six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"There I am excited when you meet Roberto Blanco, what happens then," said Jumbo cynically.
Here the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But it's worth watching.
The audience sees that the destruction of the clowns continues to be hand-working.
Because: Black forests shank is traditionally found without bones in the bone.
The secret of the shining is the spice mixing with the salt.
Smoking tower and smoking Jumbo optically remembers a "U-boat".
The trick: The tooth sides here in the smoke provide the special taste of the black forest skins.
20 days in smoking make the shining almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in Jumbo," he announces the test feeding.
"It's really nice," said the TV star's fazit.
This will enable all stakeholders to live.
You thought travel offices belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be opposed to the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenue from holidays in Australia and the UK.
The travel company is now taking account of a well-established annual profit before taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared with $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are achieved, this means an growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to record profits of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre gained eight percent in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are in good direction towards record year revenues before interest and taxes,” he explained.
These include Australia and the UK, typically one of our strongest results.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which balances a slightly weaker market for business trips.
Similarly, it was good for the free-time business of Flight Centre in Britain, while also here business customers have less cost.
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so that for the third year a profit is expected for the total year.
The shares of the Flight Centre rose yesterday by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars.
Schools are maintained for greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses for English literature, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic lyrics and contemporary British Romans from 1914.
In the examination, “unspecified texts” also find an entrance to stimulate too wide reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is cancelled.
Since 2015, students have to give a separate GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new teaching plans for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other core plants will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Supervisory Authority for Tests, announces a new organisation of GCSE structures, including a new use system and less course work.
In one speech in summer, Minister for Education Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our testing system in order to restore public confidence", emphasizing that the GCSEs would become "expressive, more ambitious and more stringent".
Studies show that in English schools, less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools are teaching at an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles indicate that the comprehensive mathematics test – combined with a stronger weighting of the trade in ranklists – will probably encourage schools to use more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on “problems of the right life”, including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious turtles lock
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and colors are presenting the circular performance view this weekend in the cemetery.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenic Conversation Forum
At the next Ecumenic Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle, the theme is "To hell with hell - Theological considerations for today's dealing with the last things".
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenic Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches Salem, the Castle of Salem and the Ministry of Culture.
Johanna Rahner wants to go to the forum of the question how today people graduate the "last things" after death.
If people had been too aware of it in the past centuries, putting them on those images of heaven and hell, "which have our ideas until today", the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of completion is more characterized by a certain negligence or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been exposed by Christian Christians by the religious crisis," says the referendum.
"It has provided us with so many questionnaires that the call marks seemed to have passed us."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the trouble of death."
This is a link to the question of that desire, "who dreams that everything may be good at the end".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She promovated in 1997 to Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenic Theology followed at the Westphalian Wilhelms University in 2003.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has included a chair for systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Small Heuberg confirm their belief in the firming
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths have been confirmed by the Selfcare Unit at Kleinen Heuberg.
On the morning, the service was accompanied by the Laudato-Si group, on the afternoon of the Youth Chair The Spirit.
With the receipt of the company bagrament, the youths said yes to their baptism and asked the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, the firms had prepared themselves under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the assistance of numerous communities on the great festival.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and experienced the youth day in Undermagal together.
Illmensee: Second Mountainbike race enthusiastic participants
At wonderful weather, 214 bicycle drivers came to Illmensee to manage the round course across the hill chains around the lake.
This tells Ulrich Knobel from the organising Illmensee Sports Association.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of heights, were many of them who wanted to practice their hobby once in the matching atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placements at the German Masterships.
These both were expected to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time in the target and defend his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
On space two, Pascal Treubel could relocate again.
Theresa Duelli from the team of nightmares made it on the top of the victory trip.
On space two and three, Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
Happy development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality.
Not only in the field of performance, the whole bandwidth was represented to athletes.
The age structure also ranged from ten years in the youngest to over 70 years with the oldest startners.
In the main race this year, more absolute topathlets were at the start.
Four drivers were able to resign from the regional leading drivers.
Including Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike helbprofessor from the Black-Tusk-Racing team.
Pangerl was already two times a world champion in twelve hours with a teammate.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls two German master titles in Duathlon his own.
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of heights, there was a wemper hit final in the target incurrent in front of the three-sea hall.
Pangerl rushed over the target line as the first.
Only a second behind the router Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall evaluation.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the goal as a third of the overall evaluation.
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place secured the area of blersch from binzwangen from Natasha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized outcome of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to distant villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people
vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle saw how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but then a inflammation that expanded to his brain and caused a haematome that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurochirurgs in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwell spent years accompanying his father in overfilled clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first one, and it's not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroons could not afford to visit them.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered in Bwelle made the decision to do something against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, who travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are forced in small buses and drive with the broken medical equipment on the roof over unconsolidated terrain to the villages that need help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and muds.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a festival, a singing and a dance, and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebrating and bwelling – with its wide smiles and its unlimited energy – at the happy celebration.
The next morning the team starts the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"Pro ride we treat 500 people", says Bwelle.
They come from a circle of 60 kilometres around the village – and that to foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, nutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive cribs, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local fraud.
The operations normally take place in a school, a council or a apartment; after the operation, the patients are upstairs and go to the recreational area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is eaten by the generator of the group and thus work Bwelle and its volunteers to the early morning hours on Sunday.
It is an effortful pensum, but village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team then drives back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free surgery last year and knows that with her work, it makes a huge difference for people to help them.
One man explained that the free operation of a break of performance that he received now enables him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, so Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at the Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and cooperates voluntarily in Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gather practical experiences that they would never get at home.
“We can be involved in surgery where we help to double blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” explains O’Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated sanitary material.
But when they are first in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and the instructions.
"He is no doubt a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no limits.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is no burden.
To help others to a more happy life and to fulfill a promise that he has given to his Father, it brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve the pain.

Excellently Undermined the Battle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novelle "The old man and the sea", is cut on the body Horst Janson.
Janson is an old hase in his metier, the art of play.
The old man Santiago can't make anything about fishing.
That's how the two just complement themselves greatly.
It is almost supposed to be able to see the folds in the neck of the old man, of whom the fisherman Manolo speaks.
When Santiago sits tired of life on the chair, that's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excellently masters.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and finally wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his willful strength.
Janson is on the stage in a wide range as a single maker.
He is able to focus on the public's attention, so his monologs are not boring a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue lighted water bottles.
Director Jens Hassselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
During the performance, he sets the active scene to light: the tabernacle of Santiago, the bar of singer Marie-Luise favor, who sings Cuba's life feeling with her songs and her glorious voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descending to the Romans
At about 120 meters of length, a waste water channel from Roman time is received below of Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne do not come by the Doom.
About 157 meters the two towers swim into the sky and make it the second-third church building of Europe.
However, just a few visitors, who support the two filigrane church towers, realize that there is a lot to discover under the doom.
Rainer Schulze is a expert on Cologne underworld.
Meeting point for its guides is the service centre of Cologne Tourism directly at the Dome.
The round starts quite unspectacular: "We start in the deep garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted to have an autojust city, so the rest of the old city walls remained only what wasn't too large.
Most users of the parking house are hiking over to the Roman remains today and just putting off their car.
But whoever looks more closely, in the Park Deck D2 discovers a archaeological foundation separated by metal gitters.
There are about five meters high ruins of handteller sized stones to be seen.
"There are the rest of the Roman city walls built after Christ in the second half of the first century," explains Schulze.
Before it gets back to the daylight, school leaves the participants on the top of the parking level to throw another look into a dark, 15 meter deep box.
This is the well of the old domain, which is, unfortunately, hardly perceived.
The next station of the round is the Pretorium, and here the participants rise down to the depth.
Here we experience the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "Stadt Roman Law and City of Agrippinenser, founded under Emperor Claudia in the place of the altar for the Emperor's culture".
And the Pretorium is the former Statthalter Palace, the power center of the Roman Empire at the Rhine.
From the front of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman waste water channel, which has been retained to around 120 meters length here.
"You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," Schulze welcomes the guests.
A surprise still has a shoulder.
After picking the key at the box, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, pleasant box.
"We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built her bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washing.
Until today, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins fall to the eighth century, different water levels have been demonstrated by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe becomes part of a archaeological zone on the city house for which the construction work is to start in a short time.
Until completion, however, a few years will be passed.
Been almost cut off: Release of Rocker Process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is rerolled after more than four years.
A trial of attempted killing, dangerous body injuries and damage to two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security provisions.
The accused swear to the date.
They were supposed to have been active in the rockers scene and belonged to the Bandidos then.
The State Advocateship invites them to put and hit in a car together with unknown complicities in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All victims were severely hurt, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims should have been part of the competing grouping of Hell's Angels.
One was supposed to have been a high-level member from Berlin.
It seems that a persecution hunting with several cars had been preceded.
According to the accusation, it was about regional fighting and a power demonstration.
The two defendants had been released in a first procedure at the beginning of 2012.
A court speaker then said it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody feather.
The killers had worn masks and had not been recognised.
The Bundesgerichtshof rejected the judgment after revision of the State Attorney and rejected it to the Landgericht.
One of the accused is currently in the open court because of another delict.
The record was mainly about the reconstruction of the courses in the night.
As a witness, the Commissioner then, was charged.
In the centre, mobile talks were held by the accused and other people who had been in the police.
It's difficult that Rocker almost always keeps a law for them and does not say it.
That also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had packed out.
State Attorney Stefan Golfier of the State Attorney Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new traces have appeared since the last procedure.
Eleven more negotiating days are set for the process.
The dismissal company doesn't think
The night was long, the music sounded and the mood was good, but sometime it's going home.
Only: The hunger is noticeable in the books of the people on the accompanying and backing seat.
Of course, he may be responsible for some cocktail or sect!
What is closer than driving to the next drive-in to make a little thing?
I admit, I'd like to join you when it's going to fast food holes late night or early in the morning.
A few pommes, a cola, a citizen - and then nothing like home and bed!
On the way home, however, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-gathers are noticeable.
Because what has to be missing is that you with steat regularity throw out your fast food suites from the car window?!
Especially in the weekends, thrown paper bags are on road edges and on parking places.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home and to the next trash?
It isn't just that the paper tools destroy the landscape.
Cottages have also covered transport facilities such as pipelines and thereby caused accidents.
But not thinking about this, it is likely that she doesn't even know what this word actually means.
When you're on your way more often in the evening, only with several people in the car, you know how a backbank can look after celebrated nights: clothing, bottles and other garbage are dwindling there.
There would be a few more or less but nothing – unlike the road, where no one wants to get around on the food residues of others.
I can see the day when the cities and communities are being stumbled and the fast food chains have to demand their pfands.
Obama's retreat in health policy
After intense criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday in his frequently repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of insurers received an insurer's notice, the Republicans cast before the President in the last days that he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relatived his original promise.
“The majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them,” he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the announcements, Obama urged the Americans who received such communications to look after a new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens could receive a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more favourable than predicted.
"They come a better offer," he said.
The government said it was a little surprising that the five percent of the people who have completed an insurance had to look around after another tariff, as their contract does not meet the new standards in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans: you deserve better," said Sebelius in a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Representative House in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I’m as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I'm determined to recover your trust.
This pronunciation of a raised Sebelius to a behind her sitting consultant at yesterday's hearing in the representative house was launched after a dispute discussion with the republikan member Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly stressed the question why the “architectural" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily reject a state-funded insurance in order to complete a tariff at HealthCare.gov itself, which she now wants to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Forces Ab
A American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday against the American news sender CNN that Israeli fighting aircraft had attacked an air weapon abi in Syrian Latakia one day earlier.
The objective was "rakets and related equipment" of which the Israeli Government feared that they were intended for the Libanese Hisbollah, said CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab sender Al-Arabia had previously reported that the foundation in the port city of Latakia had been shot on Thursday in the night of Wednesday, and the Israelis had been responsible for it.
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, on which Russian anti-defense rockets of type S-125 Newa were to be seen as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosive heads up to 70 kilos.
Insecure The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters News Agency quotes an anonymous Israeli government official with the words he believes that Israel has executed the attack, but is not sure.
In any case, a speaker of the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We don't comment on these reports".
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in Yedioth Ahronoth’s daily newspaper that the Syrian regime had already, partly successful, tried to deliver soil air rockets to hisbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt of Syria to provide hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons meant crossing a "red line", which would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented consensus that the U.S. pioneering was “inappropriately gone too far”
John Kerry, with an unexpected consent, pointed out that the US's abstaining attitude regarding their monitoring programmes was awaited by saying that in certain cases the spying had gone “inadequately too far”.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to "Autopilot" when the explosive explosive explosions of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the NSA's spy activities.
The transmitted information has led the U.S. government into a diplomatic storm of disarmament from the sides of their allies.
Kerry said in a speech transmitted by a video connection at the Open Government Conference in London: “The President and I, without question, and others in the government have experienced some things that have expired quasi per autopilot, simply because the ability was to do what is still going on the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and of course on September 11.”
Afterwards, he acknowledged as the first high-level member of the U.S. government that the US Spying had crossed a limit, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: “In some cases it has gone too far.”
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore carry out a thorough investigation so that nobody needs to feel that there is abuse here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.
Kerry, however, claimed that the NSA was a force of good and was saved many lives through its surveillance operations.
He added: “We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is satisfactory to kill people, explode into the air and attack governments.
So what if you were able to capture and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented airplane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
In the meantime, US-American legislators will travel to Europe in order to distort the concerns against the supposed American spy and to convince the Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the United States during the anti-terror attacks, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs stated on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop taking part in anti-terror organisations due to the frustration of monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that Europeans should remain on board in our joint efforts to combat terrorism," explained Murphy, who is the first democrat in the Senate and is the chairman of the Senate's Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in a interview in Washington.
In addition, I go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their concerns about NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe have charged relations with some US allies, although the head of the Secret Service said this week that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures quoted from Snowden's documents that the NSA monitored the phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other Heads of State worldwide.
The Head of National Secret Services, James Clapper, defended the spyage in allies as necessary and stated that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult Murphy said that his authority prepared the journey of the Congress to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members are to be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some “first words”.
He said that the European governments would have to be honest to their people about the type of spying programs that they have used for years.
"We can change our monitoring programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, but we must also know that we are not the only ones who are spying," says Murphy.
At the same time, John Kerry is travelling to the Middle East and to Poland in the weekend to deal with the Groll about the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
An violent injury at the Sprunggelk threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Federal League outward game of FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsburg.
Mainz calls for Nicolai Müller's use.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
He has only been able to do this individually.
"We will decide on his use in the short term," said trainer Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best gate protectors with six hits.
For the Mainzers must already quit the injured performance carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian invoices against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days prison in Phuket because she was falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed against the judgment and was released on insurance.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a province court in Phuket on 15 June of making a false statement after she had indicated to the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived in her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they were able to think about the story.
Until the trial, she was locally in police guard.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison at the edge of Phukets instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted her back to Australia.
"We are, of course, very concerned, but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible," said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on free foot.
In Australia's reports, it was read that in the meantime in the holiday village of Krabi in Southern Thailand.
The court was to hear that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher punishment of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent murder of the travelling wife Michelle Smith in Phuket, may be attempting to improve its attacked tourist image and therefore become a free speech.
