Fire in French chemical work deleted
The large fire in a specially dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This announced the prefecture of the Normandie on Friday. The fire was broke out in the night on Thursday. No one was injured in the event. The firearm was in use with about 200 discharge vehicles.
The fire could be suspended
Anrainer had been invited to not leave their houses. Buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and children's gardens were closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the shore of Seine, additives are produced for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol by the US-Milliardary Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso directive of the EU, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
In the work, about 400 people work. The chemical factory already in the past provided headlines - for example, when the gas methanthiol escaped through a hole in 2013 and the surroundings widely smoked after bold eggs. In 2015, after an operating accident, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flooded into the city's waste system.
A woman announced her job to look for 57 days for her disappeared dog
For two months a woman from Washington searched for her disappeared dog - and announced her job extra. The seven-year-old border Collie had gone from the hotel room during a short leave in Montana. 57 days were missing from the dog - but Carole King did not give up.
"It was terrible. I became bad," Carole King said to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Then when they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put dog into panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to reception. "The employee says, "It's gone about four, four and a half hours ago," Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately running out. Probably a loud thunder had put the dog in panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their dear dog, but from days were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced their job as post employee to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears floating"
57 days after Katies disappeared, Carole King received a call: A man reported herself and said that Katie was in his court. But when King arrived there, Katie was already gone again. She searched for the neighborhood and suddenly she stood her dog under a tree. "I just armed her. I didn't want to let her go," the King said, "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears fled. People kept in their cars, went out and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew that we had found them."
Losses in the Federal War: Machine guns disappear spurlessly
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six machine guns of type MG3 are still gone.
In recent years, many weapons and tens of thousands of shots are lost, including three machine guns. The remaining is in most cases unclear. The opposition speaks of a "anging" scale.
In the Federal Army, weapons and ammunition are repeatedly disappearing - many of them have disappeared unconditionally. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has booked the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts and nearly 20,000 shots ammunition. This is seen from a list of the Federal Defense Ministry, which reports about the German editorial network.
According to the paper from the office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one piece of arms and 3474 shots ammunition have been reappeared. The still disappeared weapons and arms parts include six machine guns of type MG3, eleven guns of type G3, four guns of type G36, six signal guns and two guns of type P8. In addition, 30 gun tubes for machine guns of type MG3 are missing.
The scope of arms and ammunition losses in the Federal Army is "anging," said the Left Bundestagsabgeordnete Martina Renner. This was more important, since in the course of investigations little had been found again. The left-wing politician spoke of a "drong balance". Renner criticized that the listing was not to be seen whether under the disappeared ammunition also those who were found in connection with the investigations against the federal war officer Franco A. who was suspected of terrorism. "And although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned because of the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanks "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its determination by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As ship observation data showed by Refinitive, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as a target port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tank was actually released by the Iranian government on Monday, but first he remained in Iranian waters. From the shipment it was said that one wanted to wait for an official message from Teheran.
On July 19, the "Stena Impero" had been put up by the Iranian Revolutionary Gardens in the Hormuz Sea Road under the presumption to have violated safety rules, but it was suspected that Iran reacted to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker before Gibraltar belonging to Britain.
The road of Hormuz is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region had intensified in recent months. The trade vessel was drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran. There were several incidents with tanks and drones.
Merkel appreciates the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people in the DDR, who went on the road 30 years ago at the Peacely Revolution. In autumn 1989, courageous citizens would have brought the DDR regime into the wake, said Merkel at a festival of the Thüringer CDU Group to the coming day of the German Unit in Erfurt. Among other things, the Chancellor reminded of the occupation of the Stasi Central. "The state security was taken of the horror," she said.
Musk seeks delivery record
Teslas Quartal may keep records ready. Despite the delivery tree, there were last losses in the electric car group.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given strong boost to his electric car company with the views of new record numbers on the stock exchange. "We have the chance to achieve our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," wrote Musk in an e-mail published by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customership. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. The course has not been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95000 cars and thus achieved its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. For this, six digits have to be made in the current and coming quarter. Especially the most favourable Tesla model 3 is asked, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
Mystery Solved: That's why we can't pitch ourselves
A type of brake in the upper brake prevents people from cocking themselves. This found scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments in rats, as they announced on Thursday's evening. There were also progress on the question why children are so heavily opposed to the cracking, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why only the approach of a chickening hand triggers laughs before touching. This lies on a deep layer in the brain that already triggers laughing when expecting the chicken.
According to the data, earlier research revealed that rats react with "smile" in the ultrasound area when they are consumed by people. This "smile" is being communicated by the part of the large brain circle, which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Smiling is suppressed during self-consumption
So far it has been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-controversy and contact by others - so that people cannot crack themselves. But the Berlin researchers now found that the laughing, as well as the activity of the large brain circles, is being suppressed during a self-consumption. This is also the case when living creatures themselves. During the foreign touch and the cracking by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse had been increased.
However, if you pass the self touch and touch by others at the same time, laughing is also suppressed. This suggested that the brain of the rat could not just distinguish between self touch and touch by others. The new findings pointed out that people can't pitch themselves because self-consumption activates a brake in the brain.
The rats have also been trained to cricket themselves. Thus, in experiments, they have occasionally rejected this initiative, and they have shown refugee behavior or horror stars. This ambitiousness is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the chel is a behavioural reaction that is similar to that of rats and people.
Catastrophic displaced: large fire in French chemical work deleted
The large fire in a specially dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been deleted. This was the prefecture of the Normandie of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire broke out at Thursday.
According to public authorities, no health hazardous substances should have expired. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the event. The firearm was in use with about 200 discharge vehicles.
Schools and children's gardens were closed
Inhabitants were called on not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 metres were evacuated, schools and children's gardens remained closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in Parliament after the suspension of the forced break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country without agreements from the EU on 31 October, Brussels should not accept its demands for changes to the Brexit Agreement.
About Cox, who had been involved in the stay in the United Kingdom in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and again to this country would be to carry out the EU's withdrawal." Cox was murdered by a legal extremist during the referendum campaign in 2016.
Mahnmal to attacks by Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a Mahnmal is revealed in Norway on Saturday to honor the victims. The Monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of about 1,000 iron rose imitations. They remind of the roses that had been placed by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the judgment in Oslo.
In the same place, the project of the artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed - the roses were smuggled by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. For the opening of the project, it is expected, among other things, Kronprinz Haakon and Kronprincessin Mette-Marit.
On July 22, 2011, the legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first burned a car bomb in the Oslo government quarter and, after the island of Utöya, had shot dozens of participants of a holiday camp of the Social Democratic Labour Party. Overall, 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran releases British tanks
The UN General debate brought no solution in the Iran conflict, but now there is a less problem. The British oil tanks "Stena Impero" held in Iran were able to get back into the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the Iranian President Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the ship told Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas, and the crew now drives for medical investigations to Dubai, explained Reedereichef Erik Hånell. By the afternoon the ship left the Iranian waters. "Now it's over," he said to the Swedish television broadcaster SVT.
The London Foreign Ministry referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to impair the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain shipfare and international law," said a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Gardens had established the tanks on July 19, under the presumption of disregarding sea law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing good to the circumstances, said Hånell. They would have acted professionally in view of the difficult and exciting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipment now worked to bring them back together as quickly as possible with their families.
Following the establishment of the "Stena Impero", the British Government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in Britain Gibraltar: there was a supertanker from Iran, which was intended for Syria, to be put to the chain. According to the delivery, the authorities were hiding against EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The reference to the ship had received the British from the United States.
Iran spoke of "Piratry" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Assumptions, it had been a exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" released, London rejected.
The road of Hormus is one of the world's most important seaways. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of the global oil export is shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region had intensified in recent months. The trade vessel was drawn into the conflict between the United States and Iran. There were several incidents with tanks and drones.
Behind the tensions between Teheran and Washington, the nuclear struggle stands in both countries. The Americans are proposing the Iranian leadership to want to build nuclear weapons. Iran has rejected this. The United States were in 2018 all out of the international atomic agreement, which would prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb, while concluding its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put the leadership in Teheran under pressure with massive economic sanctions against the country in order to force a more stringent and extended agreements in other areas. Iran has been opposed to the pressure so far.
Because of the struggle about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tanks in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States are working on a coalition for military protection of trade vessels in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the Hormus road at the UN full meeting in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protection powers, wants to ensure the safety of shipfare in the Persian Gulf.
India builds a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined as a "war winner". In view of the penalty duty of the American President Donald Trump against Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to dispose of. Financial managers of Asian companies who consider to transfer their production from China to another country call India in a survey of the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This has obviously not only been created with the immovableness of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pole to young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be created as a result of the globally distinguished production chain.
But now India itself has been focused in Trump's focus. From the Haudgen in the White House depreciating as "Königreich der Zöllen", America has withdrawn trade benefits for 2000 products in early June. The United States promising India prohibitively high duties and demanding a better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirituoses, motorcycles and other things.
On the world map of trade wars, riperies with India are freely a seat. America also considers the world's largest democracy also through the security-political glasses. Delhi and Washington combine the concern about China's power rights in the South Indian Ocean. In this context, a salve of American penalties against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term of office, is therefore likely to weigh in security.
However, the problem lies in another place: the empirically hardened These that open markets accelerate economic development has a difficult situation in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under Modi. Its reformers are mainly aimed at the bureaucracy mistakes, which in the multi-voluntary state at all too long entrepreneurial spirits broke. Firms now receive faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more vigorous insolvency and banking law creates conditions for the liquidation of seemingly high debt firms.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic optics in India in the first five modes of years, much has turned to the best. However, this is not true in trade policy. This is not the case. It is sealed to protect internationally low-competitive companies from foreign providers, the national conservative government even created new barriers.
In the West, modes of the Nimbus of the Energy Reformer, which is radically renewed its country. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister only knows what vocabulary western managers like. In the core, however, the "India First" lawyer never rejected a protektionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to discharge anachronistic departures and thus become fit for global competition.
Contribution of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac is to be attended a report in Paris in the next week. The former Head of State was buried on Monday at Montparnasse's cemetery in the south of the French capital, the AFP reported on the Chiracs family. The funeral will be held in the close family circle. On Sunday a public holiday in Paris's Invalidendom, as reported in the media.
The competitors were targeted: Dabo is the first secret hero of the light athletics WM
The world's tip was long in the goal when in the cooled Khalifa International Stadium heated scenes played. In the first course of the men over 5,000 metres, Jonathan Busby began to fluctuate from Aruba dangerously. He could hardly stay on his legs, walked in unhealthy position, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the western African country Guinea-Bissau suddenly suspended him and was supporting the final half stage round into the target. But the forces were still enough for both to stop the consuming armband clock after the target. As if the scene had not been curios enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was perfectly unexpected the attention of the gathered journalists. He would only be proud of representing his country, which was invited to the World Association. Under normal circumstances, he should not even start. "I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
This was done with emphasis on the evening - and much more intensely than he had thought. Because this hero will remain in memory. After all, Dabo even left his competitor Busby in the target and voluntarily took the last place - about five minutes after the Ethiopier Selemon Barega, who won this course. At the end, it had nothing to be used, because the busby was only brought into the goal with much help, just because it was disqualified at the end of the World Light Athletics Association.
At the time, Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, was attended to set up a personal best time at the WM in Doha. According to official data, however, he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I had been before." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millionmasch: Egyptians are equipped for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible government critical protests. In the centre of Cairos, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several U-Bahn stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir platform were locked.
Already in recent days, the police had increased their road controls and partially searched the phones of footers for news and photos in connection with protests. Hundreds were arrested according to two non-governmental organisations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
The last weekend, in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, it came to protest with hundreds of participants. They were directed against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Criticist corruption and misconduct. There has not been such an open protest against political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian entrepreneur and actor Mohammed Ali, who in Spanish exile exhibited the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million march" in central places in the country for today's Friday. Ali demands a "volksrevolution". The man is not good for most young Egyptians, because he is a subcontractor for the arms millions, but his messages arrived.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests increased two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) numbered more than 1.570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) organisation spoke of more than 2,000 arrests. These figures were not confirmed at first. The government also confirmed and not commented.
Voluntary arrests
Many people were "willingly arrested" "only because they were "in the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW announced, calling for lawyers arrested. The prosecutions against the arrested are sufficient, according to their lawyers, from the "distribution of false information" to the membership of a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, the security forces in uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW-indications also randomly passengers.
HRW also criticized the censur in the North African country. Therefore, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online dealer: Shipping dealers should be able to spend refunds easier
For online dealers, many packages are lost. About 20 million returns land on the waste. Yet there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online traders such as Amazon and Zalando a way to spend returned products instead of destroy them.
Although the company could not be freed from turnover tax on taxes, the Ministry stated on a question of the Green-Bundestags Group reporting on the newspapers of the Radio Media Group on Friday, but traders could put the market value of the uncoverable returns so low that they would not have to pay any or little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that the federal citizens would return every sixth package when ordering on the Internet. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - landed in waste. To spend the companies would cost additional money according to the current legal situation, because financial authorities evaluate grants as a turnover to which then taxes fall.
Greenen-Fraktionschef Katrin Göring-Eckardt urged Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to explain with an assumption that companies are able to evaluate non-procurement products accordingly and spend free of charge to non-profit organisations. The companies must be able to trust not to be punished for donation. This is not only the case for online trade but also for other businesses from fashion store to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to be expanded soon.
For Branczik, Banksy's work stresses "the reconstruction of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic preservation of animals and tribes". From Saturday the painting at Sotheby's in the British capital is to be postponed until it will be increased on 3 October. It is estimated to be 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first posted in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the Southwest of Bristol, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had released the painting again – at the same time with the original Brexit date on March 29th. On this occasion, the work called the former "Quetion Time" was renamed to "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegate Parliament").
The image could change the owner for a million.
Lastly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard stroke exchange with the opposition on Wednesday at the first meeting of the subhouse after lifting a forced break by Johnson by the Supreme Court. Johnson wants to carry out the two-two Brexit already postponed on 31 October, if not without agreements with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, embraces into the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted a picture that represents a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a bitch. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors every day when they enter the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "Spaziergang in the park"
The violent verbally attacks of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit-generators in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred. Compared to the campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "spazier walk in the park," said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book show. "We are enjoying this. We are going to get out (from the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had hardly attacked Brexit-general in Parliament in the past days and, among other things, sworn "faith" to the people. Answers that he could put the Members in danger, because they could be the goal of murder threats, he was deceived as "Humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to return to peace is if the Members would finally respect the British decision to leave the EU. It is not surprising that the people were told that the United Kingdom had not been out of the EU three years after the referendum.
On Friday, even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. "We should talk with respect to each other," said a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kashmir
With a emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again invited the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir Conflict at his first appearance before the Uno Volal Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the Atomic Forces Pakistan and India is likely to be, Khan said on Friday at the Uno General debate in New York. "If this is not possible, you are hoping for the best, but are prepared for the worst." The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this."
Since their independence of British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have led three wars, two of them around the shared region of Kashmir. Both atomic forces dominate a part of Kashmir, another part of China. In early August India had withdrawn autonomy status and thus increased tensions in relation to Pakistan dramatically.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the fall of the Egyptian president al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a harsh hand. It lets the population with sharp ammunition shoot, over 2000 arrested people sale to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting was never at risk, but since the power overtake of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything for avoiding a scenario as at times of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. poverty, perceptionlessness and the feeling of being strangled by your own government, millions were driven on the road. And this is a problem that also does not control the regime of el-Sisi, no matter how hard it is going to be against opposers. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third party lives in Egypt under the poverty limit. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is 10 percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. Since 2016, the latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stages, produces food and much more. This was already before el-Sisi so. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people has a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critic will always be then if large parts of the population have difficult to deliver a bottle of water.
Tüv-Tests in Terminal: BER-Chef: No "Showstoper" anymore for Capital Airport
Two months have been checked whether the complicated plant vessel works in the BER fire protection. The operators are satisfied with the course, but the tub is not finished on the BER.
Following large-scale Tüv tests in the terminal of the future capital airport, operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, said supervisory director Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control body.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successfully completed test, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have many details, but we don't have a real show stopper." He assured that the schedule until the operation is incorporated still contains buffers.
However, there are suggestions that the time reserve should not be too large. The construction notice is now to be submitted at the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, and at the beginning of the year it was intended for this autumn.
Hundreds of deficiencies of electricity cables are still to be resolved; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for the inclusion of the airlines, it has to continue to work intensively on the completion of the shortcomings," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there are lack of evidence, less of new cables. There is no release for all the dives where the cable trays hang. The airport manager expects it to be present until the end of the year.
In addition, the fire protection at the transition to the railway station under the terminal has not yet worked satisfactory. The problems have led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking shorts that drop down at a fire like a wall so that the smoke does not spread. They are going too far down. 36 engines must therefore be exchanged. Then it is supposed to be new experiments with heat gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other construction deficiencies as well as planning failures delay the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should be operated in 2011. The costs increased from two billion to about 6.5 billion euros from the beginning of 2006 to the start of the next year.
Because the passenger numbers in Berlin have risen significantly since then, the responsible plans to expand the airport. Therefore, it should be held at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the President of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Financial manager Heike Fölster switches to German Bahn at the end of the year, Manfred Bobke-from Camen's head of staff goes in pension next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. They put the airport finances on fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Automats for Drugs exploded - Police arrests man
He needed money for drugs - and hunted some automatics in the Chemnitz city area! Now the offender finally sits in prison!
During the past two years, the number of exploded cigarette and parking license automates in Chemnitz and the region has risen strongly. A million damage has arisen!
The police took a 33-year-old German after two detonations at the end of May on the Bürgerstraße and on the further road in Chemnitz.
Police speaker Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations due to the introduction of explosive explosions in fact, with a particularly severe case of theft led by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, not only confirmed this suspicion against the 33-year-olds."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now had eight acts.
The police speaker: "With the prize he apparently financed his drug dependency." The bomber had blown car bills on the city road four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage resulting is at least 60 000 euros!
The automade bomber is now in investigation, and the police investigations against him are continuing.
Thinkable that he was also responsible for further automatic sprongs in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group embarrassses its strategy for the Vienna Airport. In the middle of the price struggle with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa daughter AUA "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday a press speaker of Austrian Airlines against the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported about it.
The Vienna Base of the Airhansa-Billigfluger Eurowings will be dissolved de facto. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft, four remain in Vienna. The AUA will take over from Jänner 2020 in the "Wetlease", i.e. including Eurowings-Personal. Three Eurowings-Jets will be stationed in Salzburg, and Innsbruck will fly as charter machines to holiday destinations. routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings Base in Vienna is integrated into the AUA cross and the network planning, the speaker explained. The flight periods are to be agreed on flights. On the one hand, the aim is to strengthen the turning cross of Vienna and, on the other hand, to develop the decentralised traffic from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings will only be used in Vienna as a "Production Company" for AUA Group Sisters. In other words, Barcelona and Rome would be used with AUA flight number, but primarily with Eurowings devices. The board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight accompanyers would come from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights launched under AUA flight numbers will not be completed in terminal 1, but as the AUA in terminal 3.
The airport of Vienna has broke out a price struggle after the Niki route. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced only on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would increase to 16 planes next summer. The Irish cheap flyer sent four Ryanair machines as well as crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the trade union criticized as a transformation structure to the collective contract.
On Friday, AUA Board of Directors Andreas Otto replied: "We stay the number one at the site, in five, six or ten years."
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the Cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four are married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: In the Italian holidays early month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) should have stopped his friend Princess Beatrice (31), which announced the Palace on Thursday.
"We are extremely happy to be able to announce our engagement. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be actually married," the couple, which, according to British media reports since October 2018, shared in the official communication.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will be very helpful in the coming years of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos have taken her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also immediately published on her Instagram account.
A Royal Festival
The wedding will take place in 2020. For more information on date, location and everything else, the palace will be announced in the next months.
However, it is certain that the painting of the number nine of the British throne sequence and the real estate mogul will be a similar great festival as the marrying of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on Causes of Heart Disorders
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what really causes a heart weakness or an infarction? Hamburger researchers now want to look at the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to find out more detail about the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project was the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation promotes the project with 12,5 million euros. From Switzerland, the Davo High Mountain Hospital, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich is involved.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the essential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only inadequately known, said it. Now the scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8000 healthy people with the one thousand former patients of the UKE University’s heart and vascular centre.
Currently, more than 4000 of the about 20,000 relevant human genes have known possible disease-related changes in DNA - so-called mutations -, said the Klinikum. Every year about 200 would be added.
The objective of the five-year project is to develop new options such as the prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart weakness and heart attacks. The data could also benefit from researching other people's diseases, such as Stefan Blankenberg, head of the university's heart and vascular centre. New findings for interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidneys and cancer are possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong will to use the data to explore other diseases. The clinic of the Foundation in Davos has been treating above all allergy. Now, at the medical camppus there, a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created and a professor of bioinformatics should be created. To motivate his commitment, the Swiss logistics entrepreneur said that he had been operated openly in Hamburg three years ago and very grateful.
The biological samples of healthy participants originate from Hamburger who are also involved in the "Hamburg City Health Study" study. With 45,000 people, this is the world's largest local health study, according to the clinic. The inheritance is strictly respected for the protection of anonymised data, the scientists assured. It is about a Petabyte (1000 Terabyte) data, said Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich.
According to UKE, the heritage of a person can be decoded within 24 hours today. The pure cost of this is at EUR 1300. The first global gene sequence, whose results were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study is to begin on 1 October, all 9000 samples will be analyzed at the end of 2020. The first results are expected in the following year.
Nigerian police liberates hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, the police have tortured and abused boys freed from a Koran School. According to suggestions from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered some of the minor victims, as police speaker Yakubu Sabo reported. "The victims were abused. Some of them claimed to be raphed by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the presumption to be instructed and improved in the Koran. In fact, the protectives were held by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhumane conditions", Sabo said. Some hundred students, including children of nine years, were chained in a small room.
The Koran School has been present for about ten years. Inhabitants would have made attention to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents would have been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Coran School, Sabo said. They had not felt anything about the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In most of the Muslim northern Nigeria there are many private coran schools. They replace the often impaired state institutions. People in the region suffered from frequent attacks of armed bands. According to the UN refugee aid plant, in the past ten months, more than 40,000 people fled across the border to the neighbouring state of Niger.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police release 400 children from school
In a school in northern Nigeria, nearly 400 pupils were freed from disgusting conditions. "Many of them were dressed and some had visible injuries indicated on torture," said police speaker Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
There, the children were discovered on Thursday after an indication in a Islamic school. The conditions there were "human indispensable". The officials arrested the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, have been held at their school as slaves and put to chains. Some have been sexually abused.
World Football election: Further suggestions for Messis and Klopps Tor
Football "No valid signature"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe excellent
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa features the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honor and record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he had never voted in the World Football Walker, there are no suggestions from other countries to the Fifa. Egypt was not appreciated at all - with a curiosity justification.
Many of the Fifa has proved to be aggravated in recent years: the WM gifts, dubiose plans of their president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt functioners. However, the Fifa World Football Wales have not been suspected to run out unclean - if one is rejected that the voting national trainers and national team officers of the member associations often vote for sympathy rather than for objective assessment.
But once Nicaragua's captain had complained, he hadn't voted at all, there are further uncertainties: Egypt complains that the voices of National Coach Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly envisaged voting overview.
The Fifa apologizes that "the signatures on the election forms were released in uppercase letters and therefore not valid". It has been contacted the Egyptian association several times to clarify the situation without reply.
Sudan's trainer also surprised
In the case of Egypt, the Sudanese Association also states that trainers Zdravko Lugarisic have not voted as it was ultimately estimated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, the vote had also been made with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese Association.
Also, Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera had said: "Don't have voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information on my voice is wrong, thanks," he wrote. In his case, he was suspected that the nicaraguanian football association simply voted in his name.
On Friday, the message came from the association: voted, but of course was no intention. The electoral documents were "fairly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the nicaraguanian selection, said in a message of the Association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had chosen. "We take responsibility for the administrative error," said the message. Both Rosas and the team trainer Henry Duarte would have voted for Messi, "just as it stands in the official list of the FIFA".
The other cases now allow the fifa to be examined in a study, but stresses that the election process was supervised externally by the advisory company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains uncontroversial winner of the World Football Wale - and Jürgen Klopp Worldtrainer of the year.
Ukraine Business: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two ranked Republicans have spoken openly for an official investigation against the U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the republikan governor of the US state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where it comes from here it is determined by the facts that are detected." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower industry before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the discontinuation of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the discoveries, which had shown that Trump had repeatedly invited the Ukrainian President Wolodymir Selenskyi to examine the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have so far remained uncomfortable with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower business. Scott's statements are now the first sign of this in Trump's Party. Virginia's moderate governor had already been against Trump's policy several times, such as the resolving of environmental legislation and the strengthening of immigration legislation.
As further ranked Republicans, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, spoke for the investigation. "It is a deeply violating situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the convention are now to investigate the matter and go to the ground for it."
Scott and Baker, as governor of U.S. States, have formally no consensus in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided on at the convention. Hence, their statements are primarily symbolically important. However, the first senators of the Republicans have also expressed themselves critically about the situation. Mid Romney, for example, who represents the state Utah in the second Chamber, said that the case is "extremly disturbing, most devastating". The US media also reports that there were internal first rice among the Republicans.
The affair might be in line with the initiation of an official procedure against Trump, which the Democrats in the representative house have announced an investigation to do so. They are proposing power abuse for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefit.
There is no precise timetable for the mandate procedure. With its majority in the representative House, the Democrats could endeavour to make a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on a actual official delegation fell in the Senate where Trumps Republicaner have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore limited. Until now no US president has been dismissed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were tortureers at board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily, they should have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) had been arrested in June after she had unauthorizedly charged the port of Lampedusa with the Saviorship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 lybian refugees on board. After severe protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was revoked after a few days by an Italian judge.
Now there are new serious presumptions against rackets. Thus, three men tortured in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects have been taken in a recording camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognised their pianos in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any secure information about it," said Sea Watch speakers Ruben newly builters of the German press agency.
The police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically shamed and shamed by repeated and continuous physical violence," said then in the Communication.
NGOs and auxiliary organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We can't scan who the people are. They come without passes," said new builders. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also acters on the ships. "It is therefore very important that they are followed."
Italy's former Minister of Ex-Inland Matteo Salvini called for an apology from Rackete, which is still established in Italy for aid to illegal immigration.
Musk seeks delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given strong boost to his electric car company with the views of new record numbers on the stock exchange.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," wrote Musk in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the "Electrek" industry blog.
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter. The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the customership. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. So strong the course has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 9,000 cars and thus achieved its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six digits have to be made in the current and coming quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla model 3 is asked, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
US-Budget dispute: Renew only one bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a regular budget. The Senate has been followed by the representative house on Thursday and has decided a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed on an increase in expenditure ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021 in August, the United States stands before the new fiscal year starting on 1 October again without expenditure plans. On Thursday, the Senate was followed by the representative house and decided a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, it would have come to a shutdown on Monday at midnight, a partial conclusion of the federal administration. President Trump must still take effect.
Shutdown turned off
Preliminaryly, the Federal Administration is now financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the budgetary plans for the 2019 end-of-month financial year. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 expenditure laws, which are allocated to the various departments and authorities, and therefore the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the budgetary framework of 1.3 Bio. to 1.4 Bio.$.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws at the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the laws of expenditure reflect the priorities of the Democrats, which have little chances in the Senate dominated by the Republicans, and the Senate has also prepared ten of the twelve expenditure plans more or less, which are little majority.
In the Senate, the Republicans are clearly trying to force $12 billion for wall construction, one of the major priorities of President Trump. The Democrats are disturbing the wall construction plans and their financing, which is actually intended for other military constructions and projects. The fight on wall construction was already escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The spirits divorce at the wallbuilding
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue, and more likely than an agreement on all 12 expenditure laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of transitional financing beyond November 21 and then a shutdown is not excluded.
In view of the persistent inability of the convention to agree in time on the twelve expenditure laws, and the resulting danger of shutdown gains ideas to automate the process of popularity.
France allows artificial fertility for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial fertility is intended to be open to women and lesbians who live alone in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted with a large majority for a government's legislative proposal, which allows all women to use in vitro fertility, which is expected to increase the demand for anonymous seed donations.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that in the future many "children without father" could grow up. The French bishop conference is also against the innovation.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law, which the health minister Agnès Buzyn defended as "Chance" for society. It is the modern family in which children are given with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her, the cost of artificial fruit for all women is to be borne by social insurance.
Frequency with sperm from a dead husband continues to be prohibited
The National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an amendment which the widows had to give access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, the artificial fruitage of "post-mortem" was allowed. In the past, there were cases in Germany where women forgetfully complained about the release of a dead man's sperm. The opponents of the precursion in Paris argued that a so-called child would bear a "especially severe fate".
Many members of the government party La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and the opposition members had spoken for artificial fertility with the sperm of the dead partner. They stressed that a widow was raised a "double grief" if her husband’s death was still inadequate.
The initiators of the now failed amendment believe that it is unfair that a widow can be freaked with the sperma of an unknown one, but not with her own partner.
The artificial fertility in France has been allowed only heterosexual couples who cannot be children. They have to be married or live together at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the lubrication remains prohibited.
In Germany, the artificial fruitage is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples it is often difficult.
Compensation payment for the climate: calls for air delivery for unis are more loud
There is a lot of flight to the universities, so the country will also be able to make a climate charge there in the future, and the directors say they have no money for it, but now they are also under pressure.
The universities are also intended to limit themselves on flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschule
The debate on a climate delivery on flights from universities and universities, which was held before the summer break, will come back. After the National Rectors Conference has frankly responded to a corresponding lead from the green-black coalition, the plans will now receive support from universities. In a joint statement, the doctors of six bath-worttembergic universities and a pedagogic university for a compensation of service flights, which must be the first step "drillingly necesssarily necessary", at the same time, a wide debate on the avoidability of flights must be held in their opinion. The initial cabinet decision planned in July is therefore further on ice because the CDU has still not approved the presentation of the greens.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the prisoners were supposed to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days before, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. At that time there was a shift between border guards and boat crews. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, and the fisherman later suffered serious injuries.
The Communist North Korea suffers from a chronic food shortage. The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian high waters, where the coastal guard of Russia runs for their own information on the protection of their marine biological resources.
30,000 ink fish conveyed
In the case of the re-controlling, 30,000 ink fish were discovered and conveyed on the boats. In addition, the information was conveyed after three fishing and two motor boats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
Russia's Fisheries Office had not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea, according to the media have been arrested there in time this year.
The Head of Association of Russian Fisheries in the Far-East Region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close synthetic networks forbidden in Russia. These would also remove small livestock from the sea. In addition, the networks would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
Futurely only 18,000: United States lower asylum limit
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is deprived of protection seekers: As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal increase of refugees is further reduced. In the future, it is intended to receive threatened believers and Iraqi asylum.
The US government wants to reduce the historically low limit for the inclusion of new refugees again. In the 2020 marketing year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, not more than 18,000 people are to be left in the country, as the US Foreign Ministry explained. The limit is still 30,000 in the current marketing year.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastic decreased the reception willingness for protection seekers from all over the world over the past few years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, much higher recording limits had been set.
The supreme limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. Nevertheless, the Foreign Ministry called the United States as the most compassionate and generous nation in history, a formation that strongly reminds of the language usage of the Amended US President.
A "responsible deal with refugees" aims to ensure that the refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives a lot of appeal from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A major dispute is the border to Mexico that Trump wants to lock down. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had a national emergency condition. Whether there is a contemporary link between the current action and the current internal policy developments in the U.S. capital, it is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of Selensky's affair and a potentially threatening office discharge procedure.
The U.S. government will, according to a presentation from the Foreign Office, focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people persecuted for their faith - and Iraqians who have helped the U.S. Military in the country and have been in danger, as the Declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs points out. However, they are to be taken up to 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The United States intends to achieve that in particular people from this "nordic triangle" Central America in other countries request asylum. In this context, the United States have only concluded with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Hondura's migration agreements to reduce immigration at the US South border to Mexico.
Court orders release from Orang-Utan from Zoo
A Orang-Utan woman has been transferred to a reception station for human monkeys in the United States on request of the Argentinean Justice from the former Zoo of Buenos Aires. The "Sandra" born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986 was given the rights of a "non-human person" and therefore was forced to release it. The animal was brought on Thursday night by direct flight to Dallas, but not as a passenger, but in the freight room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilos of heavy human appentices are unable to adapt to life in the wilderness, they are supposed to live in the free space of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are 21 other Orang Utans and 31 Schimpans, among them "Bubbles", before the pets of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before the entry into Florida, "Sandra" has to endure a 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. Bundesstaat Kansas.
"Sandra" spent several years after her birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" in 2014 has contributed to the transformation of the Zoo of Buenos Aires into an øcopark. Until 2023, there is a research and educational site for the conservation of species diversity.
Record for Swiss Extrembergsteigers: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The Extrembergsteiger Dani Arnold is lucky at the nearly 3000 metres high tenn in the Italian Alps.
Without net, double soil or other aids, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Tent in a new record time.
Arnold dressed with Jeans, T-Shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness required 46 minutes and 30 seconds for ascension. He thus prohibited the old best mark in nearly 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in Free Solo Speed on four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefits from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sports product manufacturer Nike has booked a significant profitplus. Net profit increased to $1.2 billion in the past quarter (non 1.3 billion euro). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as the company announced on Tuesday. The main reason is the new sales strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly contacts his customers online.
In the three-month period, sales increased to $10.7 billion by the end of August. The Nike sales figures increased with a plus of 22 percent in China. Thus, the company from Beaverton in the U.S. Federal State of Oregon also benefited from its approach to direct access to consumers via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People's Republic.
Chef Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sports product manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. The investors rejoiced in the quarterly numbers - the shares of the sports product manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments on football prophecy Juan Jesus from AS Rome, the association from the Italian capital has committed a lifelong stage ban against a fan. The defendant from Brazil was intimidated by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and invited his club to take action. "@oficialasroma you already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Stolz to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The association responded on the late Thursday. He reported the fan's account at Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma trailer should never again visit a game of the association, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly scan racists against black players rivalizing teams. "We cannot have racism in society or sports. In Italy, the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. You must identify and throw the responsible ones out of the stages," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. During the first party between Atalanta Bergamo and the AC Florence on the previous Sunday.
However, there were last discussions about the followers of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now proved 38 messenger fans of record champion Juventus Turin with bans on stages. Four of them would no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police announced that the remainder would apply to bans of four to seven years.
The fans are associated with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra-Fan-groups in the surroundings of Juventus. The twelve are precluded severe pressure, money laundering and private violence. The club had played the investigations with an advertisement last year.
The Ultra leaders are supposed to be "militaryly controlled" by Italian media reports behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "controlled the tickets for the fan baskets" and should have pressed Juventus employees to come on more favourable cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennials are narcissical, the generation Z is political - all the years are considered with vigorous names. If you look more precisely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well describe these labels the respective sense of life of young people?
"The crabs come!" This call officially launched the crab catch at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun on 21 September, with the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, the southern runner of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its residents all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, the people in Gaochun began crab farming. In the course of time, the crab industry has developed into a magnificent industry that has ensured high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has actively strived for a large, ecological and scientific development of crab breeding and technology-based crab breeding. And the city has focused on promoting more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has launched a reform for "distribution of power, optimization of administration and government services" and with caution the Service Network for "approvals under a roof, a team for criminal persecution, a network for services, a platform for credit provision" and thus aims to fully optimize the environment for authorisations, services and for development.
Gaochun uses the local advantages by connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern anhui fully and uses the development zone and its position as international "Slow City" as a trailer, to place intelligent high-end production companies, biomedical and medical technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sector as well as businesses leading to environmental agriculture in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all areas of tourism zones and of national importance.
Conflict between Iran and the USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of the sanctions - Trump contradicts
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the United Nations Full Assembly, spoke of a claimed offer of the United States to suspend sanctions. The United States had, in turn, set aside all the sanctions for discussions with the Teheran leadership, explained Ruhani on his official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian Officer on Twitter: "The Iran wanted me to relieve the sanctions imposed on him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: The Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had called for a meeting to take place. "And America says I am lifting the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of criminal measures that should be completed have been taken into consideration. "And they have clearly said that we have lifted up all sanctions."
However, it had not been acceptable, Ruhani criticized. Given the existing penalties and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This should prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with the US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquakes near Istanbul - almost 200 descendants
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within the shortest time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the preliminary earthquake, there have been nearly 200 descendants, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday, thus increasing concern for a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for safety reasons. Hundreds of buildings have therefore been damaged. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the million metropole. Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes, announced Oktay.
In the past 20 years, Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for pests, said Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the let-off danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year badly built homes fall - among other things shaken by the many smaller earthquakes that shake Istanbul regularly.
City planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warned for years that large open areas registered in the centre as refugees have been long built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük Mountain in August, Istanbul's building chamber had warned that an estimated million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake safe.
The epicenter of the quake of Thursday was located in the Marmarasee in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometres of depth, as the Catastrophen Protection Authority informed Afad. A smaller afterlife was a few minutes later providing even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu notified on Twitter, injured or damages were not reported at first. The State Sender TRT showed people who ran out of the houses in panic. Students were brought out of the buildings for safety reasons in the district of Silivri. Some students wept like pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly earthquake threatened. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatole disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolian earth plate. Turkey is constantly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most fatal was the cube in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time more than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that a earthquake of strength can threaten 7.1 to 7.4. But when it comes to earthquake, it is unclear. On Thursday the earthquake again met the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have packed so-called Go-Bags with all the necessities ready next to doors, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth wakes. When the next big cube comes, be unclear.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people were injured. Some buildings had suffered light damage. The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments of the Istanbul Catastrophen Coordination Centre (Akom). According to its data, two minarettes of mosques collapsed into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning about survival in Istanbul
In the social networks many users report panic. Buildings wake up. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were interrupted. It had been stronger than that of Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Halfmond, Kerem Hospital, warned about survival via Twitter. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to CNN Turkey, the date of the population is officially indicated at 13.59 (local time). Only minutes after the first cube, there was a survival, which was indicated with a strength of 4.0 on the judge scale.
Only on Tuesday had a earthquake of strength 4.6 shaking the Turkish Marmara region - it was to feel until Istanbul. Also its epicenter was located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropole, the avad disaster protection authority informed on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that provided headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later a catastrophic earthquake could come into Istanbul - the tension between the tektonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will ever cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy calculates that earthquake is now a warning. It would have become more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," said Ersoy to the sender. "First or later the great cube will also come."
Even a few weeks ago there had been an incident - the cube also caused great concerns in Istanbul. In Albania there had been a severe earthquake only a few days ago - there was 68 injured. This year, too, on the soil lake.
Parliament: New incineration in Ukraine
Two brilliant documents provide new incineration in the Ukraine industry for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official investigation procedure, the US Democrats see themselves strengthened: The complaint submitted by an anonymous notegiver about Trump and its controversial phoneat with the Ukrainian President mountains important points for investigations against the President. Trump himself sees himself once more as victims of a "Hexenjagd". He also doubted the credibility of the Whistleblower.
USA: Airlines airline locked in toilet - Airlines redirected
Because a passenger had been locked in the board toilet, a flight from United Airlines has been redirected. The WC door had been blocked during the flight in 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline reported US media.
At an unplanned intermediate landing in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time) the woman was finally freed from the close cabin. About an hour she had been locked in it, the US media called for other passengers. To travel towards San Francisco, the passengers had to switch the machine.
In a video, spread on the Internet, which is to come from flight 1554 according to US media, it is to see how several people try to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We will soon get you out, okay?" said a man. The airline has apologize for all passengers. Open was first if the woman gets a compensation.
The kakerlake: Inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unknown.
Inspired by Franz Kafkas' famous story "The transformation" the British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book about the Brexit Chaos in Britain.
The Roman "The Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") was to appear in German on November 27th, the Diogene Verlag (Zürich) announced. It is the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now the most powerful man in the UK. He views it as his mission to do the will of the people and is willing to be disregarded from nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "If the Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged in a critical moment if ministers are shamelessly lying as once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiteers are in high positions just asking the disaster of a No-Deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write." By McEwan, only in spring the Roman "Maskins like I" published about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas' first released in 1915 is the story of Gregor Samsa, who awakens one morning and looks "to an unhearted illicit" and is ultimately excluded from family and society. "Ian McEwan necessitates before Kafka to describe a world that stands the head," said the Diogene Verlag.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austria's railway infrastructure
11.200 cars in Austria and Hungary receive fluster brakes to reduce the noise load by tractors. Furthermore, sections of train connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna's Neustadt and Sopron are modernized and electrically.
This is intended to make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, according to the EU’s authorities, from the EU’s infrastructure top "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels until 31 October cancelled
The German travel organiser Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips one day after his insolvency contract until 31 October 2019. Travel could "not be taken for insolvency reasons", the company informed on Thursday.
This also affects bookings of the brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travels, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen und Air Marin, which are already paid or paid completely. As it stands for starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance the further procedure will be examined, it said.
Thomas Cook in Germany had been invited to the sog of the British mother company and had submitted on Wednesday Insolvenzantrag. The company, including Neckermann travels, Öger Tours and Bucher Travels, is about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer hotels back from immediately
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels in abroad, who are currently staying with Thomas-Cook leavers, are to receive money from Zuich insurance. The payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that holidays are no longer invited to extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without the presentation of separate accounts, the hotels in the holiday locations are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as a Zuich speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and subject to the condition that Thomas-Cook travel from these hotels will not be invited immediately to individual payment of hotel accounts or otherwise," said Sprecher Bernd Engelien.
Insurance responded to reports from hotel guests who had, according to their own information, been forced to pay their accommodation on site themselves. Some therefore had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had sharply criticized this.
How many hotels are affected, the insolvent travel provider will be agreed on Friday, said the Insurance Speaker. According to Thursday, 70 000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschaurlauber from Germany were still on the way. Zurich Germany has secured vacation and return of Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
The now announced payments to hotels by Zuich Insurance only helps travellers who are still on the way. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on vacation, it looks bad. On the late Thursday night, the company informed that all travels would be cancelled until October 31th. This also applies to such bookings that have already been paid.
As it comes to travelling with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with insolvency insurance the further procedure will be examined, said it. Basically, insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travel has stopped.
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the company Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities for reimbursement of the travel price and apply their claims on a web form.
Prince Harry destroys the bomb in Angola
Prins Harry has long continued the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa he is now walking directly on the tracks of his mother.
The British prince Harry in Angola, dressed with a blue splitter west, burned and destroyed a bomb.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico, he put the teeth circle on Friday morning before running TV cameras. In a safe distance, the explosive bodies in the Savanne landscape exploded without damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 mine fields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same champion, who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to leave the way she went then. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a clear mine field in 1997 had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a 10-day African trip since Monday, starting in the South African Tourist Metropole Cape Town.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The risk of no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly defined: with him there will be no guarantee of a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are already forever in the polarizing British. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Britain is like a Damocles-sweak over the Blondschopf. His suspension of the Parliament to be able to carry out its Brexit course up to the date of departure, was cancelled at the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament obliges Johnson to bring about a renewal of bilateral discussions with the EU until 31 October. However, Johnson had always been disfellowed.
Boris Johnson thinks deal is still possible
But the pressure also seems not to pass to Johnson. Meanwhile, when he visited a hospital, he argued that in the event of an unanimous agreement he supported an extension of negotiations until the end of October:
You know, we'll follow the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I'm cautionally optimistic that it works.
And the time runs by the Brexit dealers in Brussels gradually. Even about six weeks, the EU and the British dealers have time to prevent the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union without agreements. However, the recent discussions have not reached any breakdown. A agreement by the end of October is currently more difficult to suggest. If the British Prime Minister does not breach the law, a re-displacement of the date of withdrawal is in force. The opposition does not believe the words of the Prime Minister, but it fears that Johnson would be able to implement the Brexit somehow in the case of a No-Deal.
US Officers: Other deaths by E-Cigaretts
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigaretts in the United States has increased to twelve. In addition, 805 confirmed and likely injured in this context, the US Health Authority reported CDC. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine was already over 900 subjects, about 500 confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage has been known. The complaints appear to be limited to users in the United States.
The fear of new protests in Egypt grows
The videos of Mohammed Ali have been divided into online networks. The construction operator and actor living in Spain calls for a "volksrevolution". For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, whose critics are proposing corruption and misconduct. Ali hopes mass reviews with a million participants in central places of the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Cairo, there was already an increased police presence. Several U-Bahn stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were locked. Already in recent days, the police had increased their road controls, and the phones of footgangers were partially searched for news and photos in connection with protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
In Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura had been protesting with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. The security forces responded accordingly. According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW) organization, almost 2000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them have been arrested randomly - only because they were "in the wrong time in the wrong place", HRW announced to prosecutors.
The organization also criticized the censur in the North African country. Thus, the government in Cairo blocks websites and online services in order to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013 after he crashed the democraticly elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, governmental participants, bloggers and activists have been imprisoned and partially condemned in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs of Greenland expedition back
The Polar researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from its Greenland expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in the Hamburg Harbour, among other things by Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the Rennjacht "Malizia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had examined and documented the consequences of earth heating in the past months on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future Movement was a blessing, said the Polar Researcher. He has waited for years for the young generation to speak. For decades, it has been known that the earth is warming. Nevertheless, many have acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often taking place under public exclusion," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of the heating of the earth and the mixture of the seas. In the expedition, among other things, a drone of greenland glaciers was measured and fished with nets to microplastics, it said.
The Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg climate week. "For all of us who are in the heart of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the price rental. "He is a witness to the changes that have occurred in the Arctic in recent decades".
Teure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourist women paid for nudels 430 Euro
430 Euros for two plates Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant close to the English city in Rome: This seemed to be too much for two Japanese tourists. The invoice with 80 euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the quitting on Facebook, which resulted in hot reactions.
"Such cases harm the view of Rome. We call on the police to check whether it is a fraud here," asked a speaker of Federagit, the association of the travel leaders in Rome according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday Edition).
The Japanese women had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified, but this is not to be taken from the bill. Also a drinking money of up to 20 percent of the bill is normal, said the host.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could, after the turbulent disclosures of the last days, actually be faced with an official procedure, the Democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the representative house as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone call with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The presumption of Whistleblower, who has made the talk of concern for national security and the democracy of the United States with his complaint at last, is monstrous: the President has abused the power of his office in order to instrumentalize the government of another country for influence on the election 2020. He has exploited the dependency of Ukraine in this field and so wants to be forced to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also to be examined in the now published medieval of the conversation with Selenskyj, even though it does not render the complete text. The phone address of 25 July is but is only a episode of a much larger history, in which the center is in addition to Trump, above all its personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes its beginning from the public view in May 2019 when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the just selected president Selenskyj in Kiev, and the lawyer knows very precisely that his intentions are nasty. "We do not interfere in a choice, we mix ourselves into an investigation that we have the right to," he says the newspaper. You can think it is unpleasant, but "this is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants to be pursued in Ukraine, for which there is little foundation - "because this information is very helpful for my clients, and it can be helpful for my government."
The lawyer and former Mayor of New York seems to have been infected with the right conspiracy fantasy that is fixed on Trump's countercandidate at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics then said to construct an occasion for Russia's disclosures in the United States. However, this presumption was never taken seriously.
The version of Giulianis and of the President is about precisely the investigations that the Trump will speak on the phone with Selensky in July. The version Giulianis and the President says: The former Vice-President and currently outstanding candidates for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, have, as Ukrainian officer of the Obama Government, forced to release the Ukrainian General Prosecutor Wiktor Schokin. In order to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible by him, in whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden was active. Biden senior has pressed Ukraine financially to consume the corrupt powers of his family.
In fact, the expiry was something different. When Joe Biden called for the Ukrainian General Attorney to go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected of it. Schokin was also self prosecuted deeply corrupt gestures, the U.S. government was not at all the only western partner who drew on his release. Moreover, the Obama government was explicitly supporting the investigations against the company.
Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp disorders: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances in Instagram and Facebook. Thus, Germany, the UK and Spain are affected. On the website all disorders.de reports users that Facebook has not been invited since around 15.30 p.m. Also Instagram reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Also whatsapp seems to be affected by the disturbance, although not yet in the same size.
Instagram and Co. often affected by disorders
It is not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July the services had fallen out for several hours. And as in previous cases, users also take back this time especially on Twitter to make their trouble air.
Polish scientists saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists have been saved from the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on their way with a slaughter boat and several miles away from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour the chilenic rescue shelver needed for the storage.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Bridge:
"We received the message at 9:30 a.m., just before ten we were started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the slaughter boat."
Poland has operated on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station , 19 scientists work there . The presumed researchers were safely brought back to their research station.
Warning: Smartphone No wireless charge
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since the last time several new smartphones have come to the market, supporting the wireless uploads and selling themselves very well - all in front of the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to start a study from early July. The wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the cableless charging of smartphones. This is extremely harmful for the devices, according to the Univerity of Warwick. This is why the much greater heat development is significantly harmful. If a mobile phone is charged by cable, the battery is up to 27 degrees within three hours. In the case of a wireless charge, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees when the smartphone is perfectly adjusted on the charging path. If the phone lies a little next to the spule, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the watt strength of the charging pad increases, which in turn drives the power consumption to the height.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of battery is a crucial factor. There is a role in each degree. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery does not only use capacity, but it does not last as long as it is. Thus, the life span is lower. The researchers therefore recommend that the smartphone always be charged by cable. Since a battery exchange is always connected with high costs, this is likely to be a helpful tip. Apple has finally increased the cost of a battery exchange even once again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient:Simply put the device on a suitable charging path - they are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without harmful cable salads and hard plug-in furme. Since Qi (contains for inductive energy transfers) has a global standard, with which exceptionally even Apple is involved, there is little limitation. Nevertheless, according to the researchers, technology should be applied only in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight thousands in six months
According to its own information, a nepalesian mountainsteiger has risen within only six months 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, announced his expedition organiser.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has once made international headlines: It comes from a photo of mountain climbs on Mount Everest Snake, which is a viral in the spring.
The picture of the mass range triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 metres high mountain and the highest summit of the earth. In May, eleven climbers had died in the climbing.
A problem for Purja could be the climbing of the 14th-thousand-thousand-three: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. As a reason for this, it is called bad weather. Purja wrote on Twitter at the beginning of the week that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a pregnant elephant cow, a police speaker announced on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protection area near the famous and visited by many tourists former rock festival Sigiriya. The animals were probably the police speaker between 15 and 25 years old. A autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The killers are often farmers on whose country the animals had previously remained harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed by elephants every year. This happens mostly when the animals move through near their living room villages.
According to estimates in Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants are still living. Theoretically, on their killing, the death penalty.
Britain oil tanks are permanently leaving Iran
The British Oil Tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its imprisonment through Iran. This announced the Bandar Abbas Maritime Office according to the IRNA News Agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Gardens had established the tanks under the British flag on 19 July under the precursion to have disregarded the provisions of the Sea Law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the Subhouse intends to investigate the pledge of traveller Thomas Cook. It is to deal with the Board’s salary packages as well as with the question why the British Government could not support the survival of the company. "Our interest is in the company's supervision as well as the control by external auditors," the chairman Rachel Reeves in London informed. "Of course, we have to do with a bad example of management."
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the cancer risk
The role of the genes in the family increased darm cancer risk has been apparently overestimated. To this conclusion, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg have come in a current study. Other risk factors such as family diets are likely to weigh more than ever. This has consequences for calculations of the individual darm cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk lets Tesla Acts Increase
This was written by Musk in a e-mail to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the "Electrek" industry blog. The demand was strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it was continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to bring the cars quickly to the expertise, which Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors enjoyed the information: Tesla's shares went out of trade with a plus of more than six percent. The course has not been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high targets. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six digits have to be made in the current and coming quarter. Especially the most favourable Tesla model 3 is asked, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the tree, there were last losses.
Will the British Government deal with Brexit law? Johnson restraining
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, considers whether he is looking for an unregulated Brexit, in the light of the possibility of an interchange of the last law adopted by Parliament, and on an appropriate question he said to journalists on Friday that his government would comply with applicable law.
The law provides that the government should request a postponement date, no agreement with the EU should have been reached by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law", which insists on negotiations with the EU.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John Major had said that Johnson could try to use "political sharks" in order to violate the law. Johnson could use a procedural strike to move the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said that he aimed at a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Iran appears to rise to uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European contractors in the fight against the rescue of the historical nuclear agreement. "The European States are more incapacity or lack of willingness to take concrete action," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the border of the UN full Assembly in New York. In the event that they do not end up with their promises, he set out "more steps" from the agreements of the 2015 hardly negotiated agreement.
Background is the conflict about the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which was a counterproduct of the commitment to Teheran to normalize economic relations. In 2018, the United States grew out of the agreement to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to a change of course in the Nahost Policy considered aggressive. The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with harder requirements and now reappear harsh sanctions against Teheran. Iran reacted to this last by rehabilitation of the Uran enrichment restricted in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now also used or at least prepared the centrifuges installed in the early September. Iran also prepares for the construction of more than 300 further centrifuges, according to IAEA.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and burden of pressured US sanctions, suspicious Rohani.
Rohani continues to contest Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Germany, France and the UK followed the US estimate that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Initially, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran in Yemen had known to attack what was considered to be a false confession on Monday. "We have nothing to do with this," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such accusations must be proof of it," said Rohani. However, the European leaders in the discussions with him during the UN General debate would not have been able to do so. Instead, they would only have called on the rebels in Yemen to not execute an attack like this. Rohani had met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in recent days.
Before possible discussions with U.S. President Trump, the extensive sanctions of the US administration had to be repealed, Rohani demanded. He urged the government in Washington to turn to a policy of "dialogue and sensation".
Coming from other star crosses sun system
Astronoms are currently watching a comet from the depths of the world’s universe. This has been done before. The comet allows receptions on other solar systems.
What was initially just a suspicion is now confirmed: A interstellar guest crossed through our solar system. The comet from the depth of the space was baptized to 2I/Borisov after his discoverer and has awakened the interest of astronomers throughout the world.
On August 30, the widegest comet was discovered by the Amateur Astronom Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory on the Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters diameters. After-views of various observations not only confirmed that it was an unknown comet but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
2I/Borisov, after 1I/'Oumuamua from 2017, is the second interstellar object that was seen during a passion of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance to get insights from nearby into a foreign solar system before it disappears on Nommerback. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometres per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that surround the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. Space Authority Nasa in a communication.
The comet is on the way to analyses on a so-called hyperbel path that leads him out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomic Union (IAU) announced. It is also responsible for designing and categorizing heavenly bodies. To honor its discoverer, the interstellar sweep star, which was first led under catalogue number C/2019 Q4, of her name 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicates that it is the second interstellar object that has been discovered in our solar system.
Astronoms have luck: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen on the flight. Thus, the researchers remain many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explained Farnocchia. "Then it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
Several observations have already taken the visitors to the vision. So a team around Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in a first study the diameter of the sky object of 2 to 16 kilometres. Recordings of the Gemini Observatorium in Hawaii show a clear sweep of the comet.
Researchers from the Canary Astrophysical Institute (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar sweifster, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of the comets of our solar system, and this indicates that its composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that cometes in other solar systems could form by similar processes as in our León's College Javier Licandro.
The discovery of equally two interstellar visitors within only two years, according to the IAU, suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such trickvisites are still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors may have a planned satellite mission from the European Space Agency Esa.
The Agency will station the three-part space zone "Comet Interceptor" (e.g. cometen-fånger) until 2028 on a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres away from the earth. According to Esa Science Director Günther Hasinger, it is intended to locate either on an unaffected, fresh comet from our own solar system, or on an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
Pointedly before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is true: On the new Mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines has been landed, a special honor for captains and crews.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers will be completed annually at the new airport, and in 2025 it will already be 72 million. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's recent prestige project is also called "Seesters" due to its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four start-up and landing trains to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new U-new subway transports passengers to the city of Beijing in just 20 minutes.
Since the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly made it possible for Berlin to learn from Beijing. The opening of the main city airport in Germany since 2006 - and much smaller - has been all the time moved. In Beijing, however, a first passenger machine has been landed after four years.
New airplane is planned to fly in 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours - of which the UK Space Agency dreams of. It is possible to make it, for the 2030s, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which is developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US-Sender CNNN quoted the Agency. "This is the technology that could definitively achieve it," said Agent Graham Turnock to the sender. "We are talking about the 2030s for the operation, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British Space Agency intends to work closer with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to Australian metropolitan is now about 20 hours. As the only overscale aircraft for passenger transport from 1976 to 2003, the Concord had covered the New York-Paris route and took three to three and a half hours for it. In 2000, an accident occurred at the start of a Concord on the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 insasses were killed. Last year, the U.S. Aircraftmaker Lockheed Martin Plan announced, together with the U.S. Space Authority Nasa, that is the "X-Plane". Virgin Galactic has also made such developments in the programme.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient journeys with a speed of Mach 5 - this means five times as fast as the sound. Furthermore, such aircraft are also available outside the earthmosphere and allow the "first generation of truly reuseable frameing equipment".
Revenue in Washington: Trump wants to detect anonymous tips in Ukraine Affäre
In the Ukraine deal for possible abuse of the U.S. President, Donald Trump wants to discover possible unnecessary places in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the information to the Whistleblower," said Trump on Thursday before employees of the United Nations Mission at New York. The person affected was almost "a spy" and in the past "a little different" than today.
This was regarded as an intimidation attempt against the advertiser. The event was not actually public. However, on Friday, several US media spread audio media from the speech. Democrats reacted to the President's statement.
The Democrats at the US Representative House had announced on Tuesday preparations for an official procedure against Trump. Their suggestions were based in particular on the written complaint of an anonymous secret service employee, which raises serious accusations against Trump and its governmental centre. On great public pressure, the signs of the notegiver were made public on Thursday.
In the context of his work, Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government staff, which the U.S. President "uses the power of his office" in order to achieve that another country joins its favours in the US election 2020.
In the centre of the presumption, a controversial call between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymir Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to explore investigations that could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It is about former businesses by Bidens son Hunter in Ukraine and supposed efforts to protect his spouse from Ukrainian justice. Biden is in the race for the democratic presidential candidate for election 2020.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine telephony also of the bleaching: leaders of the government had tried to keep the exact text of the conversation under the cover. As usual, a electronic text protocol had been prepared. This was removed from a database which was usually intended for this purpose, but it was not yet published in a specially protected system.
The "New York Times" reported that it should be a member of the CIA Foreign Secret Service.
On Friday, Trump again questioned the credibility of the source. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the President wrote, among other things, that the so-called Whistleblower has distributed information from second hand that would have proven inappropriate. Therefore there may be no hints or spyes.
As Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have given information to the Whistleblower, however, caused distress. The president of the U.S. Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted disturbed and complained, Trump's statement once again undergoed the integrity of the government.
In the Representative House, several studies have been conducted in various committees for months against Trump and its environment. In view of Ukraine's proposals, the Democrats are now taking forward investigations with new weight to initiate a possible anti-trump official procedure.
"The Whistleblower has given us a ride plan for our investigation," said the Head of the Secret Service Committee at the Representative House, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, injected him a wrong presentation of things and again demanded the withdrawal of the Chairman of the Committee. Trump insults ship regularly and had already demanded its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former US government employees from the security and foreign policy, who were mostly active among democratic, but also among republikan presidents, were in a declaration published on Friday, following the investigation initiated by the Democrats for a possible official investigation procedure. If the presumptions were found, it would be a "stroopless abuse of power" by Trump, it said.
There is no precise timetable for the further process. With their majority in the representative House, the Democrats could endeavour a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on a actual official survey fell in the Senate, where Trumps Republicaner have the majority. Thus, the prospects for success of such a procedure are limited. Until now no US President has been dismissed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW operating council: jobs are degraded "smoking"
The VW brand's plans to further reduce the cost of production could be charged with production in Germany and Europe. This concerns the car manufacturer's board. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from 10 billion euros to 2023 by two billion euros, which is to be saved by 500 million euros this year.
A key to this is the staff costs. The "future Pact" negotiated in 2016 between companies and business councils already provides for the reduction of 14.000 jobs alone in Germany by 2020. It is essential that a job can only be reduced to the automotive builder if it is demonstrated that the related activities are no longer necessary.
As our newspaper now learned from business board circles, however, jobs in production, which are not actually disposable, are "smuggling" down over another way - so passing the official course. Thus, free-run regular offices would not be re-occupied often.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no opportunity to force resettlement. In the meantime there are many posts lacking of staff, which increase the labour digestion, the concerns for gradual bleeding of the vehicle works would be greater. This will also increase the fear that vehicle production can be withdrawn from Germany and Europe, because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. The VW only said: "A adjustment of the employment volume is made as agreed socially tolerable along the demographical curve".
The VW brand wants to further standardise production worldwide and control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and also to speed up decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production board Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "We are well advised to make ourselves crises just in uncertain times from the Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China".
In this way there are already successes: For example this year, the production costs per vehicle per year will fall for the first time since 2013. Before journalists, Tostmann said that the production time for the Gulf 8, which should be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact numbers for the production duration are not called VW, according to our newspaper, it is round at Golf 7
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg tribe is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufactured components. VW-intern applies the fist rule that there are 800 000 cars to be built annually, so that the work is satisfactory. In 2018, however, the burden in Wolfsburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - due to the falling Diesel demand and the problems in turning to the new consumption and gas testing process WLTP.
However, as production leader Tostmann announced last year, in Wolfsburg, a million cars should be rolled out of the band. This is intended to enable the accumulation of the golf production in the family plant - because the work of Zwickau by reconstruction to the location for the e-auto production is going to give the golf service.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales numbers of Gulf and Tiguan have developed lastly. Therefore, the expectations are now based on the Gulf 8. It is supposed to remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburger despite all the efforts to build the e-mobility first.
Forced with Voodoo to Prostitution: Human dealers condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been occupied with heavy swords, swallowed into the ruhr area and forced to prostitution. Six suspicious human dealers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspicious nigerians from Nigeria have been sentenced in Bochum on Friday to penalty and imprisonment of up to eight years and three months. The accused had suspended young women from Nigeria into the ruhr area and forced to prostitution. To force their obedience, the traveller Nigerian women had still had to give a ritual sword in their home before a Voodoo prince.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought in sleeves through the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan sleeves. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they were distributed to various tables to work on the claimed salary costs of an average of €25,000. The reward was therefore completely reduced.
The accused - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and the subsequent distribution of the young Nigerian women on boardelles in the process. "The work made women physically and psychically difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the announcement of judgment. "Some were correctly opposed."
The judgments are based on trade and bondage inclusions of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, conservation and heavy prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm permanent struggle with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened the Ufo flight companionship with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "invite on 14 October on the LH Group's work campaigns", Ufo TAHR announced Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have refused to carry out tariff negotiations with the UFO for months, as well as the question of whether the trade union has legally announced tariff contracts at Lufthansa.
On this point, Ufo now looks stronger after a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to find that the Tariff Treaties were not announced. The Court rejected the requests. The company confirmed the decision and examined the decision to submit legal proceedings. "The second court sees the matter completely different, I think it is unlikely," said the UFO Board of Flohr.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the National Labour Court of Frankfurt to make the status of the Ufo as a trade union legally reviewed. The company argued that the trade union had not established a representative board for months and would not be able to fulfil its role as a collective partner.
In advance, a vigorous leadership struggle in the Sparten-Gesellschaft, in which many members of the board and the council have withdrawn, including the long-term union manager Nicoley Baublies. The Ufo had, due to the doubts of its leadership, exposed an initial vote on the strike of the cabin staff at the end of July at Eurowing.
Enlightened entry: Saudi Arabia announces a new visa system
Until now Saudi Arabia was not just known as an international tourist magnet, but this is supposed to change. The country on the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa rules.
With a new visa system Saudi Arabia will in the future attract international tourists. By 2030, the Tourism Commission announced that the number of international and domestic visitors would increase to 100 million per year.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is an unhistorical moment for our country," said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has been difficult for tourists. Visas are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrims or visitors with members of the desert state. With the new rules, the erzconservative Kingdom expects more revenue from the tourism business. Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones had met two of the most important oil plants in the eastern Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery of the country in Abkaik and the Churais oil field. In the follow-up, national oil production broke dramatically, the oil price shots to the height. It is expected to last several weeks until the Kingdom oil production again reaches its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are sitting in preparations for wedding
Sänger Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for her wedding. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in her Instagram Stories several party photos on which she can be seen in the white wedding view. Reality-star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized the People Magazine as a boyfriend in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colored suits printed with bananas on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me to choose my smoking for the wedding." Media reports suggest that the promi pair will marry church on the next weekend.
A year ago, the beebers were in a New York Stage Office. There was no bigger festival at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently stated that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in the case of airplane crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed in the crash of a small aircraft in the west of Czech Republic. The wrack had been discovered in a forest area at the city of Mecin (Metchin) on Friday, the police announced that the dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities have been looking for the machine since Thursday night after the crew had issued an emergency signal via GPS. In search, a military helicopter has also been in use. The accident cause has yet to be determined. The crash place is about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European trees are threatened by extinction
In addition to damages, diseases, foreign species, non-sustainable wood slaughter and the growth of cities are also causes of threat, reported the World Nature Protection Union IUCN on Friday in Brussels. It has investigated the stocks of all 454 trees known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. Of these 265, 58 percent are threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN divides threatened species into six categories: from "potentially threatened" by "threatening", "threatened," "threatened from extinction" and "deathed in nature" to "decessed". Overall, they list more than 28,000 species and plants worldwide as endangered.
Eberesh and wild Rosskastany threatened
In Germany, Ebereschen (Sorbus) is particularly threatened, one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most people are threatened because the populations are still small, or because of the conversion or weakening of their habitats."
Since 2017, they have been considered as "threatening", two of the IUCN scales. The greatest threat is the Balkan-Miniermotte in addition to a Pilz. Since the 1980s, it has spread from Southeast Europe throughout the continent and has hardly natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Roscstania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account this assessment are the trees in cities, parks and alone.
Smoking and moose also in danger
The IUCN scientists at the same time created new European red lists for soft animals, bushes and moose. More than one fifth of the soft animals and moose and nearly half of all straws are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly the destruction of the wilderness, in sliced species, agricultural practices and climate change. Weakers like screws played a key role in the recycling of nutrients in the ground and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the European Bureau. "We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 Injured Reported
In recent earthquakes in Turkey, 34 people were injured. According to the data, dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have thus been damaged. Since the cube in the morning there have been nearly 200 descendants. On Thursday, the earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the million metropoles.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
Istanbul is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquake. Under the Marmara Sea is a section of the so-called North Anatole disorder, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the anatolic earth plate.
One of the most difficult cube was one of the strengths of 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. Over 17 000 people died.
Already on Tuesday a cube of the strength had shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called upon the inhabitants to stay damaged buildings away.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira appear in the half-time show
The Latin-Pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will launch the half-time show of the next American football finals Super Bowl. This was known to the singers at Twitter. "Great will not be," Shakira wrote to a photo of himself and Lopez. She was awful excited to stand on the Super-Bowl band. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that since 1996 she had dreamed of coming up at Super Bowl - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying to heaven at the semi-time show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL exists 100 years and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She could hardly expect "to show what we can do on the biggest stage of the world".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she feels honored to stand on one of the largest stages in the world and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the United States and all over the world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it is the first time that the two "Christines" are on a stage together.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents come from Puerto Rico.
The fight against falling spectator numbers
The Super Bowl is the peak of the American football season. The game and half-time show are among the most viewed TV transfers of the USA. Even if you have recently dropped the number of audiences: This February the spectacle attracted the least spectacles in the United States for more than ten years. Nevertheless, there were still nearly a hundred million people in the cut.
For the half-time show of the last Super Bowl, there had been upset in the front: in the fight about the handling of Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, topstars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to appear in the past February. Finally, the Pop Group Maroon 5 led the half-time show - the criticisms were little friendly.
Kaepernick, then Quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was on the knees during the 2016/17 game before NFL games at the National Hymne of Protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick ran a movement, many players took over the gestures. This provided great excitement, US-president Donald Trump attacked the most Afro-American football stars. Kaepernick itself has been unanimated since March 2017 and has no longer contested the NFL party. He prevents the associations from wanting to hire him for political reasons.
Cook Guide: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are expected to stand the place of the travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report, expensive. There are high depreciations threatening to outstanding loans and loans. It also affects credit Suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in their release from Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or credit Suisse would probably have to make a total of up to 1.8 billion UK pounds (approximately 2 billion euros), according to the report.
The creditors of loans would have to depreciate from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors buy between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually depreciating are more likely to be at the upper end of the bandwidths, said one expert to the sheet.
The extent of the losses of the believers at the end will be demonstrated after the insolvency procedure is expired. A person close to this procedure did not promise too much hope. For example, the about 40 planes of Thomas Cook in Great Britain are "old" and many of the real estates are in bad situations. Most of the money can be obtained with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it continued.
Rackte is supposed to have brought suspicious murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch Captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who should have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any secure information about it," said the speaker of the refugee organisation Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognised the three men in Italy. They were proposed to rape, torture and kill people in Libya. The suspected offenders were arrested in the recording camp in the Italian Messina. New builders emphasized that the refugee organisations could not check who they had left on their ships. "They came without passes."
Carola Rackete had brought illegal migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June, with a ship of the Italian Financial Police. On that day the three suspects would also have arrived there.
The United States warns the Federal Government from Huawei
The Head of the US Internet Authority Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too high," said Pai to the "handel sheet" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which requires each company "under Chinese law" to comply with the instructions of the security bodies.
The applicable law also prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests, says the FCC head, which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "confidential declaration" from suppliers.
First of all, Berlin wants to try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, the trade sheet reports on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of hardware:
The software is precisely important to keep the devices up-to-date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change with time," said Pai.
It is "very difficult to imagine," that a government authority, "no matter where, would be able to check every individual update in real time to detect security risks," the FCC head continues.
The Chinese Group Huawei has a close contact with the Chinese State Device:
The property relationships are intransparent. The employee company, which is claimed to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai to the trade sheet.
The United States found that government employees were placed within the company. Pai was recently for conversations in Berlin to work for the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A huge fire wall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire is deleted after hours - the cleaning work could take days.
After a fire in a chemistry factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's scripts remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be open with caution on Friday, the competent prefecture announced. The Interior Ministry had invited the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and do not take off smoking. There was no harm. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals into the inside, protecting their feeds and putting the harvest first.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday night, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that after the desolation, the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, at the fireplace 240 firemen and 90 policemen and gentarmen were in use.
From the chemical factory, a gigantic black pillar had previously risen. French media reported about huge flames and explosions in the factory of Lubrizol, which produces the additive for oils. The production plant is located a few kilometres from the city centre.
The factory in Normandie belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, which are specially monitored. In the Italian Seveso in Milan, it was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of the region Normandie, Pierre-André Durand, said to the sender BFMTV that there had not been any "high toxicity" in samples at first. However, a pollution of the nearby His could not be excluded. In the river, dams were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire was broke out early at 02.40 a.m., the authorities reported. The cause first remained unclear. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port town of Le Havre.
French Minister for Finance: "Germany has to invest now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, has called Germany for greater investments to stimulate economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest and now, the earlier, the better," said Le Maire on Thursday night in the presentation of the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the euro area is weakening, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation gets worse to make the necessary decisions."
Actions must be made by those countries that had budgetary gambling spaces for more investments, Le Maire said, among other things, with regard to Germany.
France does not have these gambling spaces, added to the minister and referred to the high state debt of his country. This is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. The French state debt must be "stabilised" and "sensited", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to invest more publicly in order to experience the European economy, and German politicians have repeatedly called on France to handle its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
This is what the French Government responds to, among other things, the protests of the yellow-west movement. The new debt is to fall to 2.2 per cent, according to expected 3.1 per cent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson deviates question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson criticizes the "capitalisation law" adopted by Parliament.
However, critics are afraid that Boris Johnson could use another slup hole, but the tory politician is not able to do so.
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, considers whether he wants to implement an unregulated Brexit - despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which is precisely to prevent this.
The law provides that the government must request a postponement date should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitulation law", which insists on negotiations with the EU.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister John Major had said that Johnson could try to use "political shikanes" in order to violate the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural strike that shifts the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said that he strives to a Treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement."
Johnson's Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings also stated that he feels the political conflicts about the Brexit as "Spaziergang in the park" and proved confident that the desired EU exit will still come: "We enjoy what we will win, we will (e.g. Red, from the EU) get out, no concern," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph".
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the 2016 EU referendum, now serves as the head of the British government session Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the Prime Minister to a very unlimited situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photobook "The Polaroid Diaries" (tass) pops deep into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was clearly proud and touched when he presented the video tape "The Polaroid Diaries" in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, including Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-France Chrissie Hynde.
Following the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a quick look at the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration for LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the fast-magie of the polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who had studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always involved. Thousands of polaroids have made it, some hundreds of them are now published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, stilllife, landscapes, several Hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword. And of course, one is still at the heart: your husband Paul - how you may have never seen him.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on her shoulders, phones in the bathing mantle with a coat on his head or wears unformed moonboats. Surely the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the lighting light on her farm in southern England or Scotland also led a very normal life. According to BBC, Mary McCartney said she had been sleeping as a baby in a bed that her father had bolted out of old potato chestss. And cleared it has not always been with the McCartneys.
As hardly a medium, the Poloraid camera starts the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family daybook, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the decision Click: You have to recognize if a great picture happens before you. And then you have to knip it in exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda would have had the gift to always catch it exactly the right moment. "It just knew she had it," said Paul in the eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the image cut, and the colors, which "The Polaroid Diaries" do not only make a entertainmental image book for Beatles-Fans, but, in addition to all anecdotics, it is also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes even seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly created Beatles album "Abbey Road", which has appeared just 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel imports of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN full assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems with importing Iranian oil, since some companies had "returned because of the US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran in particular in this and in many other issues," said the Turkish President, who had repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States since their exit from the international Atomic Agreement with Iran has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic. According to the United States, Iran is following a nuclear programme in secret and does not comply with the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the breakdown of Iran's oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran.
U.S. government wants to limit the recording of refugees
The U.S. government intends to drastically limit the inclusion of refugees. On Thursday the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the annual upper limit of a resettlement programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the United States would continue to see the support of refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve U.S. citizens. Currently, the US immigration system is overloaded.
The U.S. government will focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqians who have helped the U.S. Military in the country and have been in danger, as the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows, on the other hand, to be taken up to 1500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The 1980 programme is set up for refugees from UN camps all over the world and is relocated in the United States. The upper limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a lowest value. As the predecessor of the US president Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House left, the number was nearly 85,000.
Assistance organisations reacted to the announced reduction of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the Chief of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The United States would thus further harm their leadership in protecting the most injurious people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration into the United States - legally and illegally. The US government expects, according to its own information, 350,000 asylum applications. These figures are separated from the resettlement programme.
Donald Trump - "Come near a tipl"
U.S. President Donald Trump has notified in the Whistleblower department of spying. Anyone who has given him the information that he uses power has given him "come close to a tiple," said Trump, according to a recording of a private event in New York on Thursday, which reports several U.S. media agree.
Thus, Trump spoke to employees of the United States Mission. When he was asked for the person who informed the Whistleblower about controversial operations in the White House, he replied: "It comes a tiple near." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we have done in ancient times when we were smart? Right. The spone and betrayal, we used to handle a little different than we do now."
In addition, the presidents of the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory at the House of Representatives wrote that it was an attempt to impede a convention investigation on a possible official procedure against him.
The Whistleblower presents to the President in a complaint now published that he has abused his office in order to invite another country into the US vote in 2020. Concrete is about his controversial phoneat with his Ukrainian official colleague Wolodymyr Selenskyi in the summer: In the conversation, Trump put him closely to initiating investigations against his possible democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump objects to any mistakes.
It is still unclear who are both the Whistleblower himself and its informants. However, as the New York Times reports, the Whistleblower is supposed to be an Analyst of the CIA foreign secret service.
Refugee boat centreed: Baby and little children drink in Egeic
People are always trying to get through the Agean Sea from Turkey to Greece, while regularly knowing the many too small boats. Seven migrants have now died - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed in the fall of a slaughter boat. Among the victims of death, a baby as well as four other children, the Greek coastal guard reported. Four children, three women and five men were thus able to be saved from the floods from the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broke up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses is located between Chios and the Turkish continent.
The countries from which the migrants originate have not yet been known. At present, hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Egeïan, mostly in a lot of small boats. Last year, according to the United Nations refugee aid work (UNHCR) 174 people died on this route.
The Who Aborts Concert
A US concert of the Rockband The Who has found an end in the middle of Wednesday evening in Houston because of the unparalleledness of lead singer Roger Daltrey. At the eighth song, Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it is running."
Lead Gitarrist Pete Townsend asked for apology and added, Daltrey couldn't really talk. The audience promised Townsend to get to his expense at a reimbursement concert.
For Friday in Dallas and Sunday planned performances in Denver, The Who said that they should be picked up at a later date. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining foundation members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Rental suddenly set up: WeWork lets real estate markets climb
In New York, WeWork has risen to the largest office coach.
In few years, WeWork rises from small startup to driving force to the most expensive real estate markets in the world, but now the company is in the crisis. Renters must fear billions of revenues.
The crisis of the office vendor WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had stopped founder Adam Neumann as head for a few days ago, moved the planned stocking and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private one for the leaders to win financial space for the next weeks and months. In addition, weWork, among other things, reported the British "Financial Times", has stopped the conclusion of new rentals with immediate effect, including in New York and London, the largest rental of office areas suddenly from the market.
WeWork offers large office areas for the long term and rents them short-term in partly small units of members. This can be individual free professionals, small startups or whole large companies. Until now, WeWork burns money at breathtaking speed. Last year, the company entered a loss of $1.6 billion at a sale of $1.8 billion. This year alone, the rent costs have increased to $2.5 billion in order to limit the loss, the new company's management is now to take the emergency brake and the rental of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now concluded leasing contracts of up to 15 years, which result in commitments of more than 40 billion dollars. These huge liabilities could be a problem not only for the company itself and its investors but for the whole real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhatten, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world in the past 24 months, nearly 300,000 square meters of office area. Only WeWork's new contracts ensured that the demand for offices in New York was larger than the newly marketed areas during this time. Without WeWork's expansion, office learning in the U.S. Metropole would have risen at this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". Similarly, it looks like in London where WeWork has now been operating in the best location in the United States.
Also in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could be noticeable without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork Hauptmieter is, in the centre of the financial metropole, a office house purchased by the Sparkassen Funds Provider Deka last year for nearly 100 million euros.
Many tenants have reconstructed their real estate for the WeWork requirements with high investments. WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the owners of the property would have to describe a part of the expected billion revenues. Access to the - yet small - WeWork reserves they do not have in spite of long-term rental contracts. Because the rent of the individual locations of WeWork is usually made by extra-founded subsidiaries, so-called special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only in narrow limits.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again been against North Korean fishermen. In recent days, 262 more wilders were arrested who had illegally fished in the waters, according to Interfax, the Russian Inland Secret Service informed FSB of the Interfax Agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Before the border guards had been shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injured people, said it. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortage.
Accordingly, the North Korean fishermen were on their way in Russian territorial waters. There, according to their own information, the coastal guard runs Russia for the protection of their marine biological resources, patrouills. In the re-inspection, 30,000 ink fish have been discovered. In addition, the data were recorded after three fishermen and two motor boats and brought to Naodka and Posjet at Vladivostok. According to the Agency Ria Nowosti, the coastal watch 2018 totalled more than 8.000 infringements.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had also issued no fishing licences to the North Koreans after complaints from local entrepreneurs. According to 2019, thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested there.
The Head of Association of Russian Fisheries in the Far-East Region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with close synthetic networks forbidden in Russia. These would also remove small living creatures from the sea. In addition, the networks would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed. Also the ships themselves do not describe the hygienic and technical requirements.
According to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the arrests in the previous week. A also injured North Korean died later to the FSB on his injuries. On 17 September, Russian border guards first set a North Korean boat and then a second after that opened the fire.
United States ban on entry against ex-President Castro
The United States has committed bans against the former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children on entry. The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs founded that in a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "green human rights violations". As Head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he is a system in which thousands of Cubans would be accorded and there are more than 100 political prisoners.
As chairman of the forces, the brother of the dead Revolutionary Director Fidel Castro is also guilty of human rights violations by the support of the president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The disregard of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime is responsible for the continuing crises on Cuba and in Venezuela," told American foreign minister Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump had spoken on Wednesday entering ban among others against members of the Venetian Government and the military. In Venezuela, a fierce force struggle between the government and the opposition has been tough for months. The United States has committed a number of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him into the kneee and to help the opposition leader and self-named Interim President Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allies of Maduros. The Socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of dispatched doctors. According to the United States and the Venezolanian opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government in the oppression of governmental opposition.
New climate protests from Fridays for future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, but thousands of people want to go on the road for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the movement of Fridays for Future will again plan action and announcements in dozens of countries worldwide. The beginning will be due to the time shift of New Zealand and Australia before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, the climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large-scale research in the Canadian Montreal. Also before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather.
How great the worldwide appeal will be on this Friday after the record participation of the previous week is relatively unclear. Thunberg himself was good things. "The last Friday has stretched over four million people for the climate. This Friday we do it again!" she wrote on Twitter. Until now, there have been actions in 170 countries under the stress week 6383.
Specially in Germany, the incident last Friday was very large. A good third of all world demonstrations – about 1.4 million – had been involved in protests in 575 German cities. This time a list of movements was planned in at least 65 cities, including metropols such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as juggen in northern Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt, people want to go to the street for climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set itself before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to invite politicians of their country to improve their efforts to protect the climate. Thunberg has soon developed the Fridays-for-Future movement. In particular, students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults are involved in climate protests.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against earth heating and the threatening climate disaster. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming needs to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial time.
Thunberg had arrived nearly a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high-sea race hunt in New York, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she held a emotional speech with the UN, in which she spoke to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home Stockholm, she was spoken to her on Wednesday for her use for more climate protection of the Alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
In the future, people in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony, which provides for a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a speaker of the emergency Ministry on Thursday in Moscow of the Agency Tass. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who still smokes must therefore expect a penalty of 3,000 rubels (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should open up a fire, the punishment will fall higher. Under the ban, as the Ministry has said, the same burning candles. Even grilling on the balcony is no longer allowed.
Hit against cybercriminal - eliminate servers
In the fight against crimes on the Internet, German mediators for the first time raised a large server provider for illegal transactions in the Darknet.
A total of 13 deactors are suspected that as operators of a computer center in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel have hosted numerous websites, through the internationally acting criminals operated their crafts.
This announced the General State Attorney in Koblenz. Seven offenders were arrested on Thursday night at a major action. The Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects were supposed to have been the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which had broken Ermittlers in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million Telekom-Router at the end of November 2016, according to General State Attorney, was controlled by a server in the cyber bunker.
Such a host had been raised for the first time in Germany. A web host provides the infrastructure for an Internet presence.
In the Access Action with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and the neighbouring country. It has been the result of almost five years of investigations. In the afternoon the mediators want to inform about further details.
New global climate protests from Fridays for future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, but thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the movement of Fridays for future re-planned actions and announcements in dozen countries worldwide.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolitans such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt.
Climate protests 中 Who are actually Thunberg's Hinterms?
Justification and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories that warm the climate. Even more surprisingly that a 16-year-old girl calculates the powers of this time, but what is behind? Is it helpful or wise marketing a climate activist? Historical mastership or manipulative tactics for his own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is putting the masses in motion and brings young people to pick up for a better climate-friendly world. It is historically not the first time in Europe that a young man creates a collection of children and youths for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has felt out to work for a fairer world. At that time, he has also been able to win a crowd of young people for himself and overcome the sea to reach the promised country, similar to Greta Thunberg recently made his journey to America with a sailing boat.
But there is a shadow side in this regard? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. Besides her mother has published a book that has been sold far too much, thanks to the daughter standing in the Rampenlight. Also oldest followers of Greta Thunberg were a little disposed of over the last PR show, or the journey with the boat was probably too thick. This is also not unfounded, because the action was very good in the media worldwide, and it flows a lot of money thanks to the impressive action.
Here, the spirits are now separated: Is it morally right to enrich financially in the rhythm of the world? Is it still authentic if certain circles of persons work together with stockmakers during the world's rescue action? No matter what position is at last involved, a critical and reflected point is increasingly important in a democraticly influenced society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to question critically from certain trendsetters also seemly fragile projects.
Comet discovered: Interstellar Guest crossed through our sun system
A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The assumptions of astronomers have confirmed: A foreign comet crosses our solar system at the moment - he is only the second of his kind.
Garching/Washington - The researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and is currently busy worldwide astronomers.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers on the Krim
The said body was discovered by a amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Crime. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and further observations confirmed his first suspect. It is actually an unknown comet that is not from our solar system. It is only the second of his kind that was seen during the journey.
The great chance for astronomers is now to haste insights from nearby into a foreign solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to those of our own system, as the Astrophysical Institute of Canary reports. The comet is clearly interstellar origin (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbel train that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before flight - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can closely observe him. Unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his flight, which means that he can be investigated from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Authority Nasa. "Then it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First knowledge of Comet 2I/Borisov raises hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometres of diameter. At the same time, the heavenly body appears to be similar to our comets - because, as the IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the silence star is similar to ours. This observation suggests that cometes in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have already been discovered within only two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Once again, asteroids work on the researchers. Only recently a giant asteroid passed the earth and came dangerously close to her.
"Absolutely awful": Rachel Johnson disappointed by Brother
At Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister beat with clear words the warrior language of the Prime Minister as "smallless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitation", "Betrug", "Contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and still rests up - at least verbally. At the time of question in the subhouse on Wednesday this week, this was due to massive opposition, and in the meantime another critics have reported themselves: dozen bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The famous journalist and author said to the Sender Sky News that her brother uses words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, long-dropped, quadranted, tested and feathered". She considers this awesome. She does not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had joined the EU Parliament for the anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
Especially she found her brother Jo Cox mentioned, a EU-friendly sub-house member who had been murdered by a neonazi in 2016. It was best to honor her memory by pulling through the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the subhouse. "It is very decorative to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'British first'," Johnson's sister now criticized. The acter was obviously from the right-extreme camp that felt "by this kind of language".
The widow of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick if Jos name is used like this," he twisted. The best way to honor them is to act passionately and decisively for what you believe - no matter what view you are. But never should you "demonize the other side". He also complained that a atmosphere had been created in the attacks had become more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo had set down his office as a State Secretary and his mandate as a Tory Member. "I was broken between loyalty to family and national interest in recent months - it is an insoluble tension," Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson's language also found in the church on sharp criticism. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "is not worthy of this country". In a common statement, they explained: "In the last days, the language has not been acceptable, both in debates and outside the Parliament. We should talk with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez appear at the Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: in the half-time show of the coming Super Bowl two women appear with Latino roots. They promise "a explosion of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the next final of the US football League NFL.
"I feel incredible and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because this has an incredible strength in the United States," Shakira announced in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which celebrates their 100th birthday in the next year, takes place in Miami on 2 February. In the Metropole on the southern tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a puerto-ricanic origin.
"I love the Super Bowl to put two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," explained Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. She promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents were emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" big hits and later published songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as a actress and is being seen in the drama "Hustlers" in the German cinema from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a star of a telenovela and singer. She created her global breakthrough in 2001 with her first two-speaking album and the Single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of half-time guests is expected to be in the United States every time with tension. This year many are also being selected as political gestures. Finally, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sport event and also a gigantic advertising spectrum. Musicians like Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and Rolling Stones usually look at more than 100 million television viewers, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year, there was political controversy. The fight about the Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to raise himself in the play of the National Hymne, and had, among other things, been dealt with by the US President Donald Trump. From solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super-Bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The rock group Maroon 5 was finally criticized by many.
A actress and youtuber assign Egypt's ruler: Firstly, Mohamed Ali stays abroad.
The two men who have influenced the reflux of blood on the roads of Egypt have spent the last week both in abroad. One of the two floated back to the Kairo Airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former General, Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected Head of State, had spent a pleasant time in New York: the US President Donald Trump had commended Sisis against political Islam and no Silbe lost the violations of human rights at the Nil in a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had refused to protest against the presidents. He has "no reason to worry," said Sisi on the airport in the microphone of the state. "The Egyptian authorities have not been able to lead in the United States".
Mohamed Ali remained abroad, where he is withdrawn from the access of the security forces that would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian ground. 45-year-old as a actress was known only a minority of the Egyptians. Today he is the sounding voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, the living rooms and the teestubs of the country: With his Youtube Canal "Mohamed's Secrets" Ali calls on his countrymen to raise up against Sisi.
He goes to the head of the State directly and in quite rustic language. While the people hungry, the president swallows in the luxury and leaves to build great new palaces, it says it. The army leadership, based on Sisi's reign, is producing corruption and enrichment. Because in his second work as a builder for 15 years with precisely these men's businesses, he seems to know quite exactly what he's talking about, at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the just to exploding click numbers show.
After last week, since Sisis Griff had been arrested thousands of people against his rule and almost 2,000 citizens, prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, Ali called for this Friday to a "million march". It was unlikely that so many people would wage on the streets. But there were unlikely smaller protests, for example in Giseh at Kairo and in the place China at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests whose participants were throwing Al-Sisi corruption and demanding its departure. In these protests, the police also introduced tear gas and rubber scooters. These videos were not initially verified.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators last week Banner with the portrait of the president in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces established checkpoints in the city and on the exit roads. In Cairo several subway stations in the city were closed because of maintenance work, most streets around the Tahrirplatz, the heart of the Revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaa platform on which followers of the cast Muslim brother Mursi in 2013 were disappointed until the army took it under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent unfortunate gathers: Sisis future party would be able to keep a large expertise here for the presidents.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tarir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us join police officers." However, as a retreat, this should not be understood: "Ganz Egypt is the Tahrirplatz".
If the provider promises too much performance
Apparently, the Internet connection is always much slower than the provider admitted, there are different testing options.
Anyone who concludes an Internet contract does not need to trust the speed of the providers blindly. Customers can verify, in case of accidents, how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the previously promised transmission rates are a component of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre of Bavarian.
It seems that the connection is always much slower than the provider acquired, there are different testing options. Thus, the measurement tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the Treaty.
"The tests of the providers are, however, carried out in accordance with the specific requirements of the provider and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," says the consumer central Bayers on their side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days to the provider to produce the promised performance.
If this does not affect anything even after multiple calls, customers can terminate and may also require compensation. However, in the case of remaining success only helps the complaint path.
First-range Republicans for investigation
As first-ranging Republicaner, the governor of Vermont has spoken for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think that the investigation is important, yes, and where it comes from here, is determined by the facts that are detected," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower business before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the discontinuation of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by disclosures that Trump had repeatedly invited the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyi to examine the interventions of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden in Ukraine. For Trump observed bids "since years".
Republicans have so far retained their criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower business; a few have seen discomfort. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's Party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned itself several times against Trump's policy, such as the resolving of environmental legislation and the strengthening of immigration legislation.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: further Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man-Fans: at the end of August, Sony and Marvel were known to go separate paths in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers"-universum. Very unclear how to continue with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home", which reports several U.S. media are consistent. Therefore, the cinema start should be found in the United States: the film should run from July 16, 2021.
In the magazine "Screenrant" Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am glad that Spidey's way is continued in the MCU. I and all at the Marvel Studys are very happy that we can continue to work on it ... He's the only superhero with the ability to play in different universities, as Sony continues to work on his Spidey version. You never know what the future will bring."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? Sony Marvel is supposed to have offered an offer. According to industry magazines, the Group Disney, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues coming from Spider Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the Suits Finale
After nine staffels, the series "Suits" has now reached the big final in the United States. In the last episode there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prinz Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked in the series for many years, were in a charming way awarded.
One in advance: Duke Meghan did not return to the final for a final greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the most imaginable scenes with today's Duchess. For example, the moments of the failed and happy wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his seen prison sentence.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the Suits-Final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) climbs straight towards Altar to marry his promised Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a widespread comment on his attraction. Whether he has actually thrown over a hill, the consumed Harvey wants to know from the bridegroom only to then shine: "Louis, you are not the prince of England".
Egypt: Baby and four more children drink at boat accidents
A baby and four other children are drunk during the ceremony of a refugee boat in the Aegean. Overall, seven people died in the accident, as the Greek coastal guard announced on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inousses, located between the island of Chios and the Turkish continent. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
At the moment, hundreds of migrants from Turkey transfer to the Greek islands in the east of the Euguese. Last year came on this route, according to the United Nations Refugee Assistance (UNHCR) 174 people to death. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the competent Commissioner of the European Union, he would like to "inform Turkey about the situation of refugees," said Seehofer on Friday. He would like to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens to help manage it.
On Friday, a spokesman of the EU Commission confirmed the planned journey of Seehofers with EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's internal minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, unusual many migrants from Turkey continue to arrive. On Tuesday alone, 654 people transferred to the Greek islands, said the Greek Civil Protection Ministry on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still work?
The rising figures have recently made doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU Turkish agreement, which provides that the EU can return all refugees and migrants who come illegally across Turkey to the Greek islands. In turn, the EU wanted to relocate an Syrian refugee from Turkey for each cast Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult on the Greek side because of the lack of staff. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, are almost 29 400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: In a camp with capacity for 650 people there are currently 5200 migrates.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey refugee Pact in March 2016, it has been so many, reported the state round.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to physicians, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate changes are "good safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, President of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the heart-carriage system made high temperatures and high temperature jumps in the short time and led to increased heart attacks. Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, elderly people and diabetics have been affected.
Green-Politician must be responsible for shameful photo pans
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election struggle - was manipulated for this reason of the cups?
The Canadian Green Chefin holds a multi-way cup in the hand on a photo, but now it came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has been quite long unnoticed - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metalstrohhalm, Elizabeth May, the chief of the Canadian Greens, never held in hand. On the party's website, she was looking at a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and also spread to the media – and there was still a cup (pap) cup as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green Chefin must be responsible for photo pane
The National Post then launched May Manipulation and that the Fake News Party produces to appear more credible on the subject of "ecological protection" and that in the middle of a campaign to the underhouse valley, where Trudeau also has an increasingly difficulty in terms of a scandise scandal.
The photo went Viral in the social media and applied the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a counterpart of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their one-way cups."
May appeared shocked and cursed on her blog, not knowing anything about this action. In order to underline this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in hand. However, he put her right, from Bambus. She always had it. A speaker of the party said it was only about bringing the party logo into the picture, and not to consume something. From the photo on the site is only a cut-off.
May writes that she is sorry for the employee who did that. "I don't want to describe him as stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said to the Guardian and asked her team, "If she's like to edit a picture again, they couldn't do something with my face, so that I look younger?"
The German Greens were also advised because of their use of one-way plastics or for flights in Shitstorms - their pictures were not photoshopped, however. Thus the head of the Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, at vacation ice with plastic potatoes, as noticeur.de* reported.
Influenza wants free-grade: life-long flight ban at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng was assured by mail by Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for an upgrade at check-in, it was not allowed to fly on board - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get an upgrade for the Business Class - of which many passengers dream. Sometimes they have luck, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how to not do it: A self-declared influencer has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30, it fled back from Taiwan to New York and June 7th.
On the way back, Jaqueline refused to upgrade, although she had shown an e-mail in which her Cathay Pacific claimed to have upgraded. The letter wants to have received the influence from a marketing employee of the Airline. The Airline, however, accuses Jaqueline of having falsified the mail.
After returning, Jaqueline tried to get an upgrade for long-distance flight again. This time the woman should have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK Airport were skeptical: they hacked at the centre. In fact, the employee from which the mail is supposed to have dismissed the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
Airline employees at the airport cancel Jaquelines ticket and undertake a lifelong flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (approximately 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests. Although Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not reach the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influenza has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. Airline's terms and conditions also indicate that it doesn't have to pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with it - and now turns on a lawyer.
Oil prices in Yemen according to the report on arms resistance
On Friday afternoon, the oil prices fell by more than one dollar in the shortest time. Lastly, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea Varieties Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than in the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American Sort West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
A report from the Wall Street Journal on a weapons silence in Yemen was the trigger for the course routch. Saudi Arabia was supposed to have agreed to a gun silence in four areas.
A drone attack on oil plants in Saudi Arabia had brought five percent of the world's oil production to the end in mid-September. The Huthi rebells connected with Iran in the civil war country Jemen had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US government, is responsible for Iran. A weapons resisting would degrade the political tension in the region.
If a agreement is actually reached, one could focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Department of Rumoural Strategy at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices continue its downward movement over the past days. One week ago a barrel WTI oil had cost up to nearly 59 dollars, Brent almost $65.
Lastly, Bloomberg, calling on Insider, reported that the repair of oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September, was faster than expected. Thus, the production volume has again reached an amount of eight million barrels per day and moves back towards the original quantity.
Lastly, there were several press releases calling on Insiders reporting from rapid progress by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid a stocking and negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and western countries indicated: The British oil tank "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the fixing through Iran and the recent release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepares the departure while the ship remained before Anker, Reedereichef Erik Hånell communicated to the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a SMS.
However, the United States announced that the Iranian arc enemy should be transferred to Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom had temporarily increased the oil prices during the past weeks.
Presumptions against Trump are sharpening
In the case of possible misuse of power by US President Donald Trump, deployment suggestions against the White House have become loud. Several leaders of the government had intensely sought to prevent access to the language of the conversation after a conflicting call between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymir Selenskyi at the end of July. This explained an anonymous notegiver. The speaker of the representative house, the Democrat of Nancy Pelosi, explicitly gave the White House "Confusion". Trump spoke of a "Hexenjagd".
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim as questionable
North Korea has made doubts that a third summit of powermaster Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump will soon come in the nuclear battle. The meaning and success of such a meeting would be questioned because of the lack of progress in the implementation of agreements on the first summit in Singapore, according to the KCNA Agency, the top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday.
The United States had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit last year, said the consultant of the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticized intensified US sanctions and the joint military manoeuvres of the United States and South Korea, but he hoped for a "wise" and "mighty" decision of Trumps to come back to an approach.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what to bring a third summit with Kim before he explained it. The negotiations on a disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and Rakete programme have been made up since the failed second summit of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June, both of them met in the demilitary zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to relive the discussions, but to date no great success.

Pfund under pressure - interest reduction expected
British pound under pressure
Given a rapid reduction in interest rates, the pound loses value to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations to a rapid reduction in the interest rate of the Bank of England (BoE) increase the pound of Sterling. The British currency paid up to 0.4 per cent on Friday to 1.2269 dollars.
Sales triggers were statements by the banker Michael Saunders. This one brought a reduction in interest, even if a chaotic brexit could be turned away, as the insurance would impair the British economy at due time. This statement was surprising, as Saunders as a counterpart of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista from the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens for the economy by the Brexit Hickhack without direct signalling a reduction in interest. Prime Minister Boris Johnson would necessarily lead his country from the EU until 31 October without a divorce agreement.
More: With its provocations, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk, but it could pay for him, says Handelsblatt-Redakteur Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Further Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow Analysis Laboratorium is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the only director of the World Anti-Antidoping Agency (Wada) and today's Integrity Head of the Light Athletics World Association.
On the date of the Light Atletics WM, new details of the Doping Scandinalist in Russia come to the appearance - and they destroy the few of credibility that the Russian sports had won back at the beginning of the year and also on the occasion. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Labor finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antitidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out that they were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud had been revealed in Russian sports. The Waada had locked the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During that time, Russian athletes were not entirely banned by the World Cup. The International Olympic Committee reads on individual tests at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio, about 270 athletes of the country under neutral flag, with the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start. They were also allowed to be in the World Cups in the various sports in Russia.
Missing Positive findings
In the following September, the Waada resumed the Rusada-Bann, but asked for access to the laboratory and the above-mentioned samples. The data should provide information on the extent to which doping cases were disrupted during state doping. They should help to penalize athletes and athletes afterwards. Three months later, they were finally delivered.
However, the chairman of the independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Leichtatletik-Weltverband (IAAF) has now confirmed that the Doping data were manipulated from the Moscow Analysis Labor. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We have detected many disparities between the data that the Wada was given by a whistleblower and those whom it received in January by the Russians." Many positive findings were missing in the McLaren report.
The WM does not affect
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The light athletics association is the only organization on the Bann Russia. At the WM in Doha, 30 Russian athletes under neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergo tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada Manipulations had already put in the room and invited Russia to answer the suggestions within three weeks. Russia now threatens the re-blocking of Rusada and, in the worst case, the exclusion of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
