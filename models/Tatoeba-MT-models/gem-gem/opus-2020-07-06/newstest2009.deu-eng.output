The Prague Börse falls against business closure into Minus.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague stocks were able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached nearly half of the normal daily business.
At the beginning of Tuesday's business, the Prague Börse attended the breakdown of Monday when it was lowered by six more percentage points.
This time, the reason for breaking in on the Wall Street.
In Czech Republic, the market's response to the outcome of the vote in the American House of Representatives, which it had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case experienced the shares on the stocks in Asia on Tuesday, although the indices were able to compensate some of the losses during the day.
In the course of the business day, the index of the Hang Börse in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points, but later it was possible to compensate for some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, who observed the movement of Chinese shares on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, fell by 3.8 percent, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then the losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The stocks in Taiwan fell by 3.6 per cent after the index there.
"The time for the rescue action in the United States is uncertain and will influence the financial markets worldwide," said the Head of Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would also be affected by the breakdown.
A Blood Bath of American Shares
On Monday, the American Representative House rejected the plan for supporting the financial system for which up to 700 billion dollars (fastly 12 billion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored the call of President George Bush to support the plan.
Bush's view is that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and thus help to stabilize the whole economy.
The American shares experienced a blood bath on Monday, and the main stock indices recorded the biggest break in over 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index fell by nearly seven percent, a similar inbreak had he last recorded in 1987.
The index had fallen before the vote, but hardly there were evidence that the draft would not come through in the House, the index experienced a free case.
Congress confession: US government may pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
The chief representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance to the American financial system.
It should be voted at the beginning of the next week.
The American legislators reached a breakthrough in discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the American financial system in an amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 billion kroners).
However, this does not mean any victory yet.
The Congress Members need to negotiate some details of the agreement before they may publish and vote on the final text of the law.
The financial system support plan will be negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services said Barney Frank of the Agency of Reuters.
According to the Senate, different information may probably be agreed on the plan at the beginning of Wednesday.
Economists believe that a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first important psychological factor for the relief of the financial markets.
Thereafter, however, there will be a "enthusiasm" due to the complex mechanisms, as to how to help the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a significant progress.
We have clarified our different views about how a package of stabilisation of the market should look," said the Democratic Group Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to their words, it could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met with the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson in the evening to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of unproduced mortgage assets from financial companies which decay the financial companies in severe losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're at the goal," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian transactions
The global financial crisis also strikes itself clearly in the stock markets that fall strongly.
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were trying to reach a final agreement at the convention before Sunday.
This is why we want to reassure investors from businesses on Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision of the Congress could affect businesses on Monday.
Until now, however, it is not quite clear when both chambers of the American Congress will be voting on the law, but there is no clarity about whether the negotiations could not still fail in the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next days.
However, the law will experience some changes.
The total amount specified for aid to the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion will be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
However, the Congress can block the disbursement of the rest of the money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, with more than $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush's positive progress in negotiations
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress can vote on its veto.
In spite of these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme has remained, which was based on the acquisition of financial assets for the purchase of poor mortgage accounts, whose value has been valued, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've done everything.
The representative house should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday," said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His speaker Tony Fratto explained that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimated the two-sided effort to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy".
Restriction of golden fallscreens
The Chairman of the Banking Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the leader of the subcontractor, said that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the monetary programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the completion of benefits and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law also aims to limit the so-called gold case screens for directors of the companies involved in the programme and set up a committee to be responsible for the supervision of the Fund.
This is intended to lead the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and achieved a great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also calculates with a help for home owners who have problems with repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new hypocrisy rates that it purchases, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological aid
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to Patria Finance David Marek's main economist, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And therefore, because you don't know what mechanism and the price of the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government break the losses together," said Marek this week to the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of the next week, Mareks considers not to be decisive.
"It is much more important that the Congress Members agree to support the plan and to adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on an adoption is the most important at this moment," said Marek.
Duell on Messers cut: MP3 player against phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can still phone.
That's why it looks like it's better to buy only one phone.
Despite all, there are enough reasons why you should be an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and claims of the future owners.
Surely you'll hardly buy a great, expensive record player at home to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
Once such musical news does not appear on LPs, and for a qualitative view there is no objective reason for it.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the regal, you probably dream of at least one.
This is the same way with the music on trips, i.e. with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but also a pink-floyd fan will probably hardly operate headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The lifetime of batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play a lot more than just music, but what phones can do does not even create a breathing way.
No modern device is used as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, phones and simsen, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, even a worse photo device and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and photograph no television.
But the universality of the mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the more often you will have to upload it.
And playing music is one of the largest energy feeders.
Only a few phones can play music longer than ten-twelf hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (particularly the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, in the cheap phones, you should expect that they can not play music more than a few hours.
If you are then calling occasionally, you would prefer to buy another charger for the office - this also applies to expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good holds out at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one upload.
Another problem exists if you want to overplay the music on the phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB shutdown, and not every phone can be connected directly to a PC without specific software.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a storage medium, but just a few card readers are done without reducing the small memory cards used in mobile phones.
For players, you do not need any special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves place a music library, ordered by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the Genre or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to operate, phones can do more
When selecting a specific device, you should explore especially after the life of the battery, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and, of course, the comfort of use.
If music is especially for you and you hear it shortly every day, for example, in the roadway, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost every phone can do.
You don't have to check specially what music formats a phone or a player can process.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will be just in this format.
The format is one of the most widespread and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding sites of a provider (or another provider) via the mobile internet, and you can purchase a song or album.
This service can already be a profound argument for why a music phone should be placed.
Unfortunately, the offer of the provider is bad and is usually limited to fast radio heats.
Prices are also not the lowest.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of sale of music (if it is via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The phone wears most of them.
If you want to listen to something, take the phone in the jacket bag while the player is forgetting at home.
However, it is important whether you are always carrying a headphone or at least a wireless free speech device.
If not, you can take back to the integrated speaker that has almost every phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The most likely advantage of music phones will be in price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns, you already get a very decent Walkman.
The largest patient will be for most that no normal headphones are involved.
The best and technically mature phones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is in the easy operation again.
The easiest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - Players can really use everyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity to the previous normal tape recorder or, for example, the recorder is obvious.
There is no threat to collision in the form of a misleading mobile internet and a then horrible account for data transfers.
What device should you now handle?
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding map, two thousand crowns are rich.
But respect.
The base models usually support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already want to have a mobile phone and buy another cheap MP3 player, then take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB) you will not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Among the more demanding hearers, please take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the comfort of the operation comes to one single MP3 player.
The biggest part of this is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) provide MP3 players of the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, there is something missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic to lower prices.
Maybe this one will not be able to wait for a long time.
The fact that the Czech mobile providers are working to the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported this on Mobile.cz.
This also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price for a SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there is so likely a paradoxical situation - for some of the Czech mobile providers SMS will be cheaper from abroad than at home.
Why are prices in Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight response.
Perhaps it sounds paradox, but in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
On the other hand, the mobile providers are happy to squeeze about the extremely much competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who had often said in the past that there was no room for another supplier in Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network does not have any extraordinary chances (but he would probably also find little frequencies).
There is still one option - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers to the mobile market led to a significant reduction in prices, which then also had to react to the classic mobile providers.
There were still voices similar to those in the UK before entry into the market of companies such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile.
However, it has proven that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples for a long time.
In February this we reported about the start of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just a half year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus rise to the country's 5th largest supplier.
Behind Mobilking, the financial group of Penta, which has U:fon in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
Virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider to work effectively.
They do not need a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone talks and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilizing in Poland shows, it can also be a very good chess to set up a non-critical target group.
This provider is specially addressed to men.
"Clear guys choose mobile - the provider who can trust them and who they can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept could be taken in Czech Republic as well as in Poland.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
It is also relatively saturated from the viewpoint of the service offering."
In Czech Republic without chance, the mobile providers think
But it is almost certain that when a virtual mobile provider conquers Czech Republic, this will not be mobile.
"Because we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not look very hopingly.
It will be more likely to enter the market in other countries of our region," says a telephone talk for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, press speaker of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile providers in the Czech Republic are not unusually attracted this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything for no potential competitor.
For a long time, their interest in launching a virtual mobile provider has shown the GTS Novera group, who wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the business sector.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network services, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them we have already been able to reach negotiations progress," said the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
Maybe better times come now.
Not official information shows that the first virtual provider may be expected until the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an unconquerable wall of silence.
"In this moment we do not assume that there is space for a fully-quality virtual provider in Czech Republic.
The Czech market shows great specificity to other markets.
Until now, no subject has been addressed to us with a complex and serious project in this area," says in his statement to Mobile.cz Vlastimil Sršeć from the Telefónica O2 press department.
Other providers also point to the specificity of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds rarely to the statement of O2: "We have, for a while, not found a viable and beneficial project on which we could continue to build."
And she adds: "The network of T-Mobile will hardly appear in a virtual provider until the end of the year.
At this moment we had to have a concrete offer to be able to think so short-termly."
Vodafone is more focused on compliance with the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "For negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we consider from the viewpoint of our customers as the best.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet."
The responsible authorities - hand-hand with the providers
The operation of the mobile providers is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, this would lead to lower prices and thereby also to a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor be facilitated to enter the market?
That the providers can draw on a strike when it comes to something, also proves the long back and down to the origin of U:fon.
The most likely pressure towards ČTÚ went out of the company T-Mobile at the time when U:fon came to the market.
This also demonstrates the public information available from the ČTÚ websites.
But now, U:fon is just suitable as a argument why you shouldn't allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile provider.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new actor in the market itself and, above all, his services would require high demands."
However, in view of this approach by the mobile providers, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is astonished.
This is not only the attitude of ČTÚ, which, unfortunately, in Czech - unlike the UK and other highly developed states - has not the competence to intervene in economic competition.
It exclusively owns the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this was related to this whole problem of his very typical attitude.
"The entry into the market of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider via the leasing of the necessary infrastructure.
Until now, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classical providers," said Kristián Chalupa in his answer to our request from the ÚOHS Department of External Relations.
This would not surprise representatives of the providers.
A authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that nobody abuses his position on the market, this is more than concernful.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual providers work very normally, it is to observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices in mobile phone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction is probably not among the interests of UOHS.
In this case, the almost already touching conformity of the three mobile providers, resulting from their reactions, is really shocking.
The question is whether it is really just a coincidence.
Just as the absolute same fuel price at the tank sites is surely only coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs in this matter indicating an action against competition, and therefore it has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the suppliers have a dominant market position, so he does not have the appropriate increased responsibility for his actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual providers are likely to lack the regulatory authority for telecommunications," Chalupa stated in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, designed by ČTÚ, after telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
Of course, in such a market none of the Czech mobile providers have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer another perspective - for the entry into the market of a virtual provider, the approval of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile provider has - logically - the monopoly for his network.
This means that it is necessarily taking a dominant position in a specific segment.
However, even if you do not agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the UOHS that three mobile providers act similarly.
The complaints of a number of interested parties (including the company GTS Novera mentioned) prove that they are encountered very similar obstacles in negotiations with all suppliers.
The remuneration of the responsibility for the ČTÚ is then a very common trick in the telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS is distant from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recent Novelle of the Telecommunications Act has failed to implement the extension of ČTÚ's competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of UOHS need to know that too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay if nobody looks at
Notwithstanding, the functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider remains the same in the Czech mobile networks.
It is companies who publish their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partly public.
Usually, it is companies acting in the Multilevel Marketing area.
Your own mobile phone services, for example, offer Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only chosen ones.
The joke of the case is that the company is acting against the operator as a classic company that orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the Terms of Conditions of All Czech mobile providers prohibits a similar resale.
"If there are cases you describe, it can be an infringement of the contractual conditions, with which we will then deal with what can lead to an end of cooperation with the relevant society," Martina Kemrová answered our question to this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not go around with the mobile providers.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
Because they do not have negligible profits from the activities of these companies, at the same time, in contrast to the actual virtual suppliers, they will not be affected by the actual official marketing.
On possible problems Miroslav Čepický points out: "The law allows such speculations, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run on their names, so they cannot have fully over as the normal customers of the mobile providers."
But the ČTÚ must at least be weird.
In addition, another question opens up for the ÚOHS.
Close the mobile providers in front of such a procedure, why are they blocking against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the UOHS has very strong competences to detect such activities, and if it does not want it, it does not have to satisfy itself with the declaration of the providers, they know nothing about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has been stressed several times in the text, the entry into force of virtual providers brought a significant price reduction in the various services.
In fact, in all countries where virtual providers have been created, classical providers have tried to prevent their origin virtually more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a market too small, or too saturated, problems with quality of services, etc.
However, in the high-developed countries, the regulatory bodies, which did not at all attempt to safeguard the interests of mobile providers, were just at those moments.
If it was by formal measures or non-formal pressure, they reached the first virtual operator, and then further.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing up the whole case like a hot potato.
On the basis of our experiences, we cannot disclose the impression that unclearness in the competences in these cases is more than favourable.
But we don't throw the flint into the grain.
If the background information votes and soon a virtual provider appears, the Czech mobile market may be in motion soon again.
If a provider permits the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the UOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to refusing (discriminating) other stakeholders.
And the Czechs will finally not be more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National Hymne where is my home country at the day of the Czech State.
The hymne was replayed by the National Theatre's orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female sologesang, in chorography and in a instrumental version.
The vocal record took over Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the Hymnen versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions immediately.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech National Song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already said to the Czech broadcast that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices that are significant and popular for the Solo variants.
"From the beginning I tried with both and then with the choir to keep a clear dictation so that you could understand the text well to make a consensus," said the Dirigent.
The Czech National Hymne goes to its 175th anniversary next year.
In 1834, the song Kde domov męj came on the stage of the stand theatre in the original Czech piece of Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously accepted it.
The first strike of the song was then become an organic part of the National Hymne after the origin of the Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained after the origin of the independent Czech Republic.
Who sounds the "new" Hymne
The Prague transport companies transport on Wednesday also on a chip for the first time
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of Prague transport operations as a date when the first passengers will enter a subway, roadway or bus that will carry an electronic coupon in the bag instead of a paperboard.
These can currently buy about a hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day coupon or an annual coupon (applicable from 1 January 2009) at the same time, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the Muzeum subway stations, M & T, Nadraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letěany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Since yesterday, the Coupons have also been available via the Internet on the sites of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used until the afternoon hours of more than four hundred customers.
Those who use the Internet sales can really forget the output window in the U-Bahn stations, where they have had to wait regularly in long snakes for their paper licences.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, it is played on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places, travellers are also available a switch with trained staff that advises interested people when buying the Internet and also plays the coupon on the map," said the speaker of the project Martin Opatri.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on self-service machines on the open card that are fitted in some U-Bahn-Vestibüls.
How do these automates look?
They are red, remembering drivers, the passengers may have noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská stations.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but until the end of the year it will be eighty," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls an automate instead of the driver
The operation of the automates that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to enter the chip card, and the previously acquired coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons are not only in the capital from tomorrow, but also in the surroundings.
So in the pre-current trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants from municipalities of the region Middle Böhmen come to the capital.
"In the trains that belong to the Integrated Transport of Prague, train accompanyers have readers with which they can examine the validity of the Coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the Ropid Organisation. This organisation compiles the travel plans for the Prague transport operations.
The foretown buses have card readers on the box with the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown in the driver but the Opencard is placed on a marked place on the side of the box.
So the driver controls the validity of the played coupons.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the played coupons, nothing is easier than the driver to ask for this information," said Drrápal.
A passenger who doesn't drive with predator buses and no longer know when the Coupon's validity ends, can go back to the self-service machines where the Coupons are played on the map.
Here the information on the validity of its documents is shown on the display of the device.
The Sudete called for a referendum from the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans had asked the United States for anglement of the Bohemian Forest.
This is found in a letter stored in the collections of the Southern Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the United States of America.
With such a wish in 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans would have turned to the U.S. presidents.
This is part of a letter that has remained in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the Southern Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American President that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengaus" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - to the Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure that the American units do not enter as oppressors and enemies of the German territory, but as a Savior," it says in a letter signed with the words "People who are at the heart of the fate of the Sudes".
Since the connection to the Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans – in the knowledge of the Czech national character – suspect that they would expect grossity, insightlessness, inconsistency, oppression and slavery, the writers of the letter ask the American presidents to take over the protection rule over the Bohemian forest for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that without taking into account the view of a quarterly million inhabitants of this area, you have spoken to a foreign state for us, trying to oppress and eliminate minorities, and not at all contributed to the victory of allies," reads the letter.
The reason why the authors are not able to sign is, as it is said, the fear of revenge of the "Czechian suppressors".
If the U.S. President doubts about the minding of the Bohemer Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he in Bohmerwaldgau initiated a referendum on whether the inhabitants would become part of the United States or live under the protection rule of the United States.
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of postwar history may sound a little naive, some contemporaries consider it to draw a good picture of the Sudeten Germans' expectations at that time.
Although the Bohemian Germans at least had to realize that they would be negotiated about their dismissal from the Republic, only a few of them accepted such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Again others believed that they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budweiser German at the East Sea Marine.
When he arrived in British prison at the end of the war and brought him into a war prison camp to Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would come to pass them," said Chalupa.
None of the German prisoners who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia believed that he would be dispersed from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš Decree.
You don't think - then pay!
An emotionally loaded campaign is focused on car drivers
The most expensive action on the roads in Czech history.
The emotionally loaded media campaign was also characterised by the Ministry of Transport in order to start Wednesday.
The authority of Minister Aleš 中ebiček promises to take rid of drivers of dangerous behaviour behind the steering.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on flyers.
She is supposed to take the drivers from too fast driving and alcohol on the tax.
And they also remind you of beating up before traveling.
The campaign intends especially to speak to young drivers, motorcycle drivers, walkers and, not least, professional drivers to conscience.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also shows:
You don't think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in uppercase letters on a mark sign.
And in a blood laugh the word "pay."
This means that you can pay a moment of innotation with your own life.
The spots will shock the spectators by 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Angelsax countries, where you can see normal images with dramatic recordings of accident victims.
It is promised that the accident numbers and the number of traffic deaths fall on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar bread and peeces for the drivers
"For the drivers, the motto is sugar bread and peat.
Sugar bread means that, for example, when they drive with red, they save time.
The peitsche then is the threat of a punishment or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," said Na Homolce Martin Kořán's transport psychologist.
And that is why information campaigns are necessary in the press and, above all, negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
He believes that tables are less effective, which make drivers aware of a danger.
"If you set up a static table that warns about a danger, it is likely to be closed with the surroundings, and the drivers will no longer see them," Kořán says.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert has spoken for the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan hills, when peace with Palestine and Syria could be concluded in exchange for it.
He stressed this in an interview printed on Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to return to the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israelian territory) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would also include eastern Jerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as it has happened to one of my best friends, will have to quit a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted on two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister's words, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple bears and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old city.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he further confirmed.
Deduction from the Golan hills
Olmert spoke for a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan hills, which, in his view, is an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require certain efforts on the sides of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria alone on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Highs," Olmert confirmed.
"The Syrians only know too well what they need to leave to get the Golan hills back.
They will have to reject their current relationship with Iran; they will have to refrain from their relationship with (Shitish) Hisbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they will have to give to the terroristism of the (Shitish) Hamas movement, the Al-Khaida terrorist network and the Djihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," concretely stated the Prime Minister.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards illegal in the bus?
The law does not know it, in a distance bus it is not allowed to run around
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the Society Student Agency near the Italian Padua, the question is whether stewards and travellers may run and run on the bus during the journey.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," says Karel Hanzelka's Deputy Minister for Transport.
The accident that killed a 20-year-old stewardess last week was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
The young woman was sitting at this moment at all accidents next to the driver, at the least safe place in the car, although she had two more places.
However, a bus can also have an accident at the moment or bremse sharply in which the steward carries coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped with standing places after the vehicle letter.
If this is not intended in the bus, travellers must sit.
The distance buses of the Student Agency have no standing places; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this has first not agreed to the movement of travellers.
Later, this has been taken back, and we have reached a consensus to which travelers may go to the toilet when they have their seat", he informed his position.
The law doesn't know a steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legal regulation describes this role.
However, there is no legal regulation that prohibits the transporter from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the term of passengers, but its rights and obligations do not define it," the speaker of the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly adds.
On the other hand, the Director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Joseph Pokorný, believes that the law covers this problem afterwards.
"It depends on whether the bus in the product license also has standing places.
That's all," he emphasizes.
Buses are divided in city buses where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, nearby buses with standing pitches and a higher allowed speed and distance buses without standing places with the highest allowed speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, the expert says
The BESIP driver for transport safety Jaroslav Hořín sees no fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In a liquid drive, there are not many dangers, the situation is similar to the service on board a plane.
Even here is not sure when turbulences come, and the Stewardess can hit the head."
"Breaming a bus sharp, however, then of course also apply the laws of physics.
Just as in the city bus or in a roadway.
The security of Stewards must clarify the transporter by means of internal rules," he says and also believes that this problem is not completely resolved from the viewpoint of the law.
Jančura is ready to stretch the services
Student Agency offers as the only bus company services of Stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not regard her profession as risky even after the accident.
"As soon as I get the impression that the profession of stewards is risky, I will stretch it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive travellers at the entrance.
That would also reduce the costs," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of Stewards in his bus. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have steward dinner, but we're already resisting from the beginning.
Earlier or later, this ends with any fatal accident," he had not said a whole year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy
At the accident of a line bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region was devastated, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably buried off without blinking from the stop strip and had locked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to deviate through a sharp manoeuvre, but collided with the right front part with the truck.
Jančura contests that the two places had been sold for the Stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved in remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to accuse truck drivers.
With a compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the court judgment, but a financial compensation is also expected from the sides of the guilty.
A change in law?
Not visible
A more precise regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could provide a legal regulation on which a thirty-found expert team of the Ministry of Transport has already worked over a year.
"This, however, has not reached a concrete conclusion yet.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the pointing system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the ride," said specialist Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of Stewards to be a major threat to the safety of travellers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of the police and the labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorfer hopes rest on Frankfurt
In large words, there is no lack in the letter of the WestLB board to the staff of the house.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf Money Institute with the Frankfurt Deka Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen Financial Group" can be created, says the letter announced on Monday.
The WestLB brought into such a business a "competence block" with sustainable yield power.
And at all such a link could be the decisive incentive to further bonds in the country banking sector.
This is how it is read if a board wants to demonstrate actionability in difficult times.
Because the attacked WestLB is still under huge pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervisory, which has recently cleared the northern Rhine-Westphalian national government that urged the time to find a solution for the future.
The WestLB has been speaking for some time - also on Frankfurter Seite - of a link between the Deka bank, which knows savings customers because of their investment funds.
Although Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas has told in the presentation of half-year numbers at the end of August, in a merger of the house at Mainzer Landstraße with a national bank, for example Helaba or WestLB, he does not see any sense.
However, the Deka Management Board, held at half of the national banks and savings banks associations, has commissioned the Board of Directors to conduct discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be about the capital market business or parts of it.
The discussions have just started, says at the financial space.
The deka bank, which, with its 3000 employees, is one of the more important employers at Frankfurt's financial site, is not the first time talking about consolidation in the savings banking sector.
In 2003 it looked like a moment to merge the Deka bank with the Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, from this triangle was nothing.
Nearly the plans had become public, the Hessian Government rejected the participation of Helaba.
The two other houses did not then find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Baden-Württemberg Landesbank in Stuttgart.
However, there have been repeatedly thoughts about a link between the Deka Bank and national banks.
However, Günther Merl, the presidency of Helaba, had recently spoken against plan games about an association with his house.
Independently, however, it appears that the knowledge that a collapse of the various houses of the public sector is necessary does.
After the country day election in Bayern is over, first of all, a connection of the BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be reached.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
If the pressure rises to further mergers, she goes on to the partners for it.
In the south she was only more Junior partner, although she had been through the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
A relationship with the West LB again, the Sparkassen and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which is involved with 85 percent in Helaba, has foreseen a riegel at the beginning of the year.
At least stay the North LB.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
The second is the question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June Merl, the decisive question with which to ensure the future capacity of the national banks, had not yet been answered by the German Sparkassen and Giroverband.
At the end, a breakdown of the West LB could also be possible, but it is not self-speakingly desired there.
Thus, in the letter of the presidency there, it is spoken of it that, in any case, there is a "total solution" to the house.
How this can be brought under a hat with the interconnection of individual units with the deca bank, it will still be shown.
The second week is known as "Italy Weekend"
For Elena it's the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his friend, and so is everything different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer basin of the Kaiser brand, a massive gardener stands and proves the 200 October festival travelers, which deep tones can produce his throats.
Elena's gonna give Luca a kiss, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parking place next to the station Puorta Nuova, starts four buses this evening at 23.45 p.m., "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", arrives expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are primarily reserved to the Italians, in a bus traveling exclusively Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing alongside their flag, celebrated already in the night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says it's nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long mantle with pelzimitate feed and a glass with wide silver hills, belongs to the buses.
For five years they go to the October Festival, three tours are alone this year.
At night, on the wheat, back at 22.30 p.m.
Night stays would only mean unnecessary foods, says Marco.
75 Euros cost the ride, the Welcome Summer Drunk with Kaiser-Bier, brew faithfully the Bavarian purity command, the health insurance and the German-speaking guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer yet.
Quickly it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers will sleep.
All right, they'll still need their powers.
In Brixen and wooden churches, several other buses with Italian marks are held shortly before Munich.
When Marco's group finally arrived on the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half seven o'clock, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather themselves, Marco holds a last speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, put on the yellow jaw.
On this left is "Octoberfest", in Fraktur, the Internet address of Marco's travel office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors go up to the beer cell, it says run!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the places in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow muds on the same benches, distribute in the room!"
The scale, brilliant Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget drinking money.
"The security officers show that we are doing good!
As soon as you leave the places, they're gone!"
Thirdly, "Tonight, point half eleven again here!" Do you understand?
And now it's goin' to spoil.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as roadmarks to the trees, to signs and even to the election plate of a large Bavarian people party.
You want to be armed for the withdrawal.
It's the second week, known as "Italy Weekend".
There are no precise information about figures; the talk is of 50 000 who are on the way over the Alps and fall into the beer cellars, ten percent of all visitors are supposed to be extra in Italy on this weekend.
The Munchner Police is strengthened by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads to a national statistics in which the Italians put the first place before British (approximately 60 interventions) and Austrians (approximately 80) with about 200 medical services.
Particularly popular with Italians is the courtroom.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, emphasized Federal Minister for Finance Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How well the politician used the word "relative" and also influenced that the German banking sector would not be consumed by the crisis-like developments.
For it has now arrived on the weekend.
The Münchner real estate financer Hypo Real Estate (HRE) recorded in Dax receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to protect themselves from the turbulences to the markets.
A person familiar with the situation said Reuters on Monday that credit aids amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The hypo Real Estate only needs to retire the part it also uses.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses with the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he borrowed money, the State financer had refinanced extremely short-term - which is no longer possible because of mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve was cut by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the capital rate had slightly yielded from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current revenue and net revenue from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year period, the revenues from tenders for claims and certain securities and the resolvation of deposits in credit transactions by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenues from reimbursements from reimbursement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest in accordance with the tax regulation and the provision of business for Groups, the income minus had been moderated by around 16 per cent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former State Financer had initially speculated himself with commercial real estate credits that had then been divided into the Aareal Bank.
Because of the lack of earnings in classical state funding, Depfa had then increased in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the State (Private-Public Partnership, PPP) and international diversified.
At the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now has to make depreciations that will have a "essential material effect" on the group's profit and loss accounts, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend has been deleted.
She had already been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a significant government and infrastructure financer since the Depfa acquisition.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on the refinancing of the interbank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the loans to the banks are reassigned largely since the banks heard their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing appropriations for a part - about EUR 50 billion - of the Depfa credit portfolio.
According to the Communication of the Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered with the loan at due time and the company is "protected from the influence of the currently incapable international monetary markets".
From other sources, it is clear that the money has guaranteed refinancing by the end of 2009.
The HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets at due time.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervisory (BaFin) assume that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
This stands for shareholders and creditors of the Bank.
But in view of the dynamics and immovableness of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even impossible that the financing does not have to be fully used.
But also the opposite is not to be cut out.
After the insolvency was still before the bank on late Sunday evening, at least provisional salvation cannot reassure the moods.
The share rate breaks 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the currencies of loans are quite well maintained.
If the priority debts are hardly moving, the courses of the post-learning are more clearly reflected.
In particular, the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the durations beyond 2009 are affected.
As a speculative alternative to investment, hypo-real-estate loans should be considered to be depending on the stability of the international financial system after the clear intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had taken the crisis into the house with the adoption of the Depfa.
As long as note banks, governments and less-deployed business banks are still ready to support the system, there can be a timely retirement of pensions.
Or that happens, which is hardly awaiting anybody at present - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports transmitted with the sub-government, the probability of security has now only become a legitimate hope.
Especially long - term believers would have to prepare some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
The short-term investors can always use a loss presentation for future tax payments on course profits of later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of school at the Tachibana High School, the girls begin to cook: The Germans are totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first school day in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before school.
I live on the edge of Tokios in the direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes with the train to the Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, lucky I didn't go.
The start of teaching at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strictly defined as with us at home in Lower Saxony.
The students twist in from eight o'clock until about twenty before nine a short meeting round with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the lesson began, I was on the line to imagine myself.
I am not the guy who likes to speak before people even before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform yet, I attracted an old rock of my host mother, bleeding, blue knees, and black leather shoes.
In this elevator, I put myself in front of the Pult and tried to express everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, come from Germany and have an birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started to learn the language well two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all scratched, cooked and wound, and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the surviving vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'little, sweet'.
Then I'll be hurried fast in my place.
The girl next to me grew pretty wide, she found it an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really stumbled.
Everyone talked through and cooked and asked me holes in my stomach - it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
In the break, all of them packed their bentos.
My host mother had made me such a lunch box - that's something different than the fatty German pause bread.
I had rice with herbs, little wursts, salads of gurks and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantle.
Mostly I don't have a bleed shaving, just what I'm eating here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely curious.
It's clear that everything's really nice.
Well, up to the salty plants, maybe, brrrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which then makes her artificial – in the hope of getting to know the boys at the breaking snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm excited if I can watch this too.
"Why do you calculate Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said,
'Cause it fascinates me.'
Finally, I've been reading the most popular mangas for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture in it, I've ever started to learn a little Japanese.
So I realized that I had to go here sometime.
Because I also have a feasible for tradition, morals and practices.
And there's a lot of value on them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not felt lost here yet, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
Does a rat or a sheep flee at risk mean that she feels fear too?
The neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
Just how can you check if they feel the same if they are like us?
The Internet magazine " Edge" has published contributions of famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presented in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I think animals have feelings and other consciousness conditions, without that I or anyone else could prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, as all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and circumvent questions of feeling or, in general, of consciousness, we enter an indispensable area because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat is in danger, she does the same as many other animals: she is dying, fleeing or attacking.
People act similarly, from which some scientists point out a similar subjective experience.
I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
Firstly, the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the side-front cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and the execution/controlling functions).
This wide region is much higher developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be totally missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness, which depends on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is therefore reason to assume that man even distinguishes from the other primates.
Another dramatic nature is likely to be in the language nature of man: Since so much of his experience is associated with language, it often says that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
However, even if consciousness does not diminish from language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may have been created, probably was very different from most of our consciousness conditions.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may look for other animals.
If it, as something internal and subjective, does not measur or, due to the special hardware, can be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, his research poses great problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more scientificly accessible.
It is possible to examine the consciousness processes of animals without consideration for their content, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they are more related to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the presence of visualization.
What is the result of the feelings?
I revert them to an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "furcht" is the mental condition in which we are in when the activity of the brain-located defence system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) proves memory.
It is seen that feelings are closely bound to the regions of the Cortex, which characterize the prime and especially the people.
Related to the language nature, the sense is fine, because we can differ and categories with the words and grammar conditions, in order to assign them to others alongside ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that feelings from more primitive activities in the cortex and the brain tribe are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it could be involved in cross-border feelings.
Theoretically, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is invisible.
Pankseep argues what appears in rats and people like fear, probably feels like in both cases: But how can you check if rats and people feel the same when they act similarly?
A sheep flee at risk if she feels fear too?
In my eyes, mere behavioural similarity cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison continues to help: rats and people have similar brain stems, but don’t even give a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove that to humans, how did you want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even sheep (who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings probably differ fundamentally from those of us (which human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
Anyway, there are progress on the neural level, if the same is measured in rats and people.
How I don't explore language and consciousness in rats, regardless of feelings, I don't know if they exist.
You may think that is short-sighted, but I'd rather come forward than walking against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Convenience deadline for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be put under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Ministers.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just started and there is still much to do in both countries."
In the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of the stages, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts are behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM states is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We must now work at the highest speed," said Ukrainian Association President Grigori Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep us constantly in the eye."
A more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish Association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and has been replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met on request by Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the EM 2012 will not suffer."
Several initialists had been condemned for compulsory reductions alone during the last season, and even the Liga start had to be postponed short-term.
Empire Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about Privates in the interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood Star Meg Ryan outet her released Dennis Quaid as a adulter.
He swears - and hits back.
Late Rose War at the Ex-Ehepaar Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood players are now having an unprecedented dispute with each other - in all public.
Meg Ryan had first said in an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week about the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful for me for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud has only been experienced after divorce.
An occasion for the soul-striptease was Ryans press work for her new movie "The Women" - the story of a adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Unholy," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News", that "For a repeated time, I recover and recover the history of our relationship."
It should also be "reasonable" that the shared 16-year-old son Jack is again "remined publicly of the pain and change that means a divorce for each child."
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has been married again and has recently become father of Zvilingen.
And so close his bills with the side-hieb: "My life is going on anyway.
I appreciate my joy that I have a wonderful family that's doing the best."
Prices for tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights, according to a current study, have even become up to 50 percent cheaper.
Flights and nights in hotels have become more favourable - this is the result of a study of the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, it found a significant breakdown in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, the nights have already been approved in many places.
From January to March, prices increased by an average of 6.9 percent in 41 of 48 European cities, compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year before.
As a cause, American Express sees the weak dollar course that has led to a "decreasing desire of American tourists".
Also, financial spaces such as Frankfurt or London are more affected by the decline of hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices, with an increase of 26.3 percent, even hold the record in Europe.
The trend in the first quarter also showed up in the flight prices:
Due to the cerebrovascular renovation, travellers in the Economy class had to pay 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-distance flights were even more expensive than 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices for air tickets of the Economy class decreased by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in the business and first class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices were even higher than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
According to the study, German domestic flights have even half the prices.
On the one hand, the company explains the reason for the price breakdown.
The demand breaks in many segments of the flight market.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
Signs of the excited situation were the cutting unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – these were 24 airlines alone in Europe.
HSV strikes Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburger SV will be table guide.
At the Borussia, Luhukay still fails to find a working eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein Enlarge Bruchlanding for National Player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher first came in the game lately and failed with a lifter to the late.
His message was precisely formulated, she persuaded him over his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate," shed Hermann Rieger in the cabinet of the Hamburg Arena.
Many weren't left in the catacombs, the half-time break was finished and most were sitting on their places again.
Rieger was nearly three decades of physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a higher view than some cast actor.
And so his request also found a hearing at a responsible place.
Assistant trainer Cornelius Jol nicked and void the thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief trainer Martin Jol.
This command will have sounded similarly: come with two gates!
Implementation remained out.
"There wasn't everything to look at today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have wished "relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers are due to Mladen Petric's headball killer (11.); and the circumstances that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburger.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol assembled.
The Hamburger SV becomes 121 years of age on Monday.
The spectators celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky over the Arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which showed their association as class primus.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to order it," said Marcell Jansen.
He realized that the tablery intermediary is more for the incompetency of the League than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its lately committed access - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Torshield Petric, and the Jansen, who is delegated by the FC Bayern, is slow, but can't be glittered yet.
"We need more flair and more Dribblings," asked Jol.
After the vote
On the Wall Street, fear is about.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily made Dow Jones break in about 700 points.
This was the greatest point loss within one day in his history.
Later the Dow got back something.
By 20:30 p.m., the world's most important stock barometer recorded at 10.579 counts with about five percent in the minus.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was at 1548 points with more than seven percent in Minus.
The biggest loser was at that time in the Dow American Express, who had almost 14 percent in the bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of the Bank Goldman Sachs gave up about 10 percent.
Only a few days ago, capital investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
In the framework of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called "faul hypocritical documents" are intended to be provided.
But the sum is to be paid, not at one strike, but gradually.
On the contrary, the State should receive share option cards of financial companies which could be solved in the course of the course to reduce the burden on the state fund.
Share rates in Europe and the United States in the downward season
The billion aids for banks in Europe and the United States do not address the doubts of investors.

The Dax cast clearly under the psychologically important 6000 points brand and recorded with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5.839 points.
Worldwide the stock markets went into the knees.
In New York the Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the $700 billion heavy rescue package of the US government could not be sufficient to bring the financial markets back into swing.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 per cent at 10.809,25 points during the first trading time.
The US Representative House wanted to vote on the rescue plan, which the Senate may follow on October 1st.

The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook are not sold.
Dark matter affects flight of space zones
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has provided advicelessness: Dark matter affects the speed of space zones during so-called Swing-by-Manover.
Experts fear that the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein could not be quite correct.
Nearly 18 years the space zone "Ulysses" fled through the space.
Due to soon frozen fuel pipes, you are now threatening the cold.
For years, among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion - the Swing-by-Anomalie.
The Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of space zones where they receive additional swing in the gravity field of a heavenly body, such as the earth.
This allows the sins to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Research Son Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the Sunson Ulysses.
But what the researchers have been surprised for years: the airlines do not act 100 percent as they would be expected by the aged gravity law.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The sins become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physics have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him Swing-by-Anomalie.
Some experts fear that even the general relativity theory of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by crumbling the room, might not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still believes that Einstein did not mistake, and attempts to explain the Swing-by-Anomalie using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made up in the universe.
"Sponsible for anomalie could be dark matter that could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
From the existence of the dark matter, space researchers have only known for about ten years.
Apparently, there is an attractive force from her whose effect can be observed on other heavenly bodies.
It itself, however, is completely invisible, i.e. it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, the dark matter is still well one fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the tourists in Egypt will be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros of redemption.
In the case of a shooting before the release, six hosts should have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans have been kidnapped.
Solutions negotiations should already be carried out.
The Germans are always going to the Vision of Kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE paints the main cases.
The European tourists in the Sahara are apparently free.
This reported the Egyptian public television, the Arab TV broadcaster Al-Arabia and Italian media agreeing.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to the reports of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostiles have been released.
We're just checking their state of health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions are well-known and in security, reported the Egyptian public television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on the way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostiles remains unclear: therefore, the kidnappers were prepared to terminate the kidnapping of Egyptian security officers before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom money," said the official.
It would have been "only to take the hostages to receive" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot six of the kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt on Sunday and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, calling on a German mediator, the release of the hostages is delayed because the kidnapers feared their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers had a safe refuge.
The German message in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Usage of the stepfather "led to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather has led a woman to kill himself, has been reported to a court.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithian, Cornwall, received a six-year imprisonment after he had faced eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Court of Justice in Truro learned that he regularly caught his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Mrs Randle killed her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived as a child in Coventry, Trerise had bound her and connected her eyes before he conducted sexual acts, while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife were divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Mrs Randle, who worked a large part of her time honorably for the National Trust, was persecuted by abuse that had been added to her twice a week.
Staatsanwalt Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Mrs Randle, who had been a diligent surfer and bicycle driver, had been "emotional dead" since 2006 and "had abandoned her life"
In April 2007 her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by sticking himself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the stepfather of his daughter, who wrote a confession letter, who concluded: "I used to bind her and connect her eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for their death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been terrifying for her victims, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the victim's suicide.
Even worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended before court if it had not done so."
He added: "I noticed the effects, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, on her daughter over the years.
She would otherwise have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officers responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the "public security law".
The man was delegated by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no evidence of criminal intent.
BBC Defense Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action had been a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "You would have thought that this would be an internal challenge in the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The person whose name cannot be mentioned shall be charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause covering the safe storage of information.
The Royal State Attorney recommended that the officer be accused by the Metropolitan Police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he transferred contained classified evaluations on Al-Quaida and the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Housebuilding companies see B&B Costs in the eye
British housing companies could be at home after saving Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million pounds.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million customers.
The interest rates for this loan are paid by all companies who receive money from investors, including 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Apartments (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "incompatible" that the companies and their members would have to pay.
Finally, the 14 billion loans will be paid back when Bradford & Bingley's loans are removed.
However, the interest gained in the meantime will be calculated annually to the 700 financial undertakings that accept payments.
The Compensation Programme confirmed against the BBC that 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions who have acted carefully... are now called up to take some of the costs of the institutions who were far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company had to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together had to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest rates for the loan will be 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies have to buy 81 million pounds for the interest rates of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Apartments, informed the BBC that he believed that this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions who have acted carefully during the real estate recovery are now called on to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records have been recorded in 1945.
"We will watch all aspects of this matter over the next weeks to see what alternatives are available to protect housing companies and their members of potentially significant costs."
The interest rates which will fall in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will fall for a full year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are two-sided organisations without companies, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest rates on spare accounts.
Milk becomes five Pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it will increase the large market price of its milk by another five Pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two Pence increase in February, and comes after investigations carried out by a consulting company.
The retailers should decide whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the Grand Market Price of Jersey Milk changed by the last year in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is rejected
A court in Bangladesh rejected a caution request by former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Their defenders said that the court refused to put 50 million Taka ($729,700) in charge of the charge by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several floating charges for corruption against them.
Sheik Hasina's long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released against insurance at the beginning of this month.
Sheik Hasina is supposed to return to Bangladesh in the next weeks, but her party, the Awami Bundnis, demanded that the military-based transitional government should give her unlimited freedom first.
The correspondents say that, although their arrest was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of their release whether they will continue to remain on the free foot when they return to Bangladesh.
Their lawyers indicate that they will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheik Hasina's Cautionsbitte because it says she doesn't have to get a guarantee because she is already in prison in abroad to be treated in abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a complaint against the upper court."
Their lawyers insist that they need insurance to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the elections in December.
It is expected that Sheich Hasina will return home after 17 October, a Awami Association Party Chairman said on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-supported transitional government had taken over the power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheik Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all the charges against themselves.
Fears for the Anti-Political Initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-Political initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination programme last week in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to one UN speaker, this was the case despite the promise of the Taliban that thousands of people who were carrying out the vaccination were not to attack or hinder the vaccination.
BskyB loses complaint in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost his complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competing sender ITV.
The competition court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission had previously claimed that BskyB's share distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on the ITV broadcaster.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed into Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competitive Authority reported that the purchase of the share in ITV by BskyB made doubts about the independence of ITV, which moved the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom Communications Office have spoken against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV would be an unwise and excessive measure, especially because BskyB had announced that BskyB would give up his voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. State Advocate Department
The U.S. Advocate General has commissioned an expert to examine the announcement of the nine state prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice in which the actions of administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, legislators and former General State Attorney Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been suspended for political reasons.
The special mediator Nora Dannehy is now supposed to clarify whether the officials under the investigation have lied to the mediators to impede justice.
Severe objections, including criminal action, have not been fully examined or clarified, said in his report, General Inspector Glenn Fine.
The calling of a special mediator with the power to force the Witnesses to say was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Ministry of Justice withdraws nine US lawyers from their offices in December 2006.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be released because of weak work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed state lawyers had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to view the announcements as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-level republikan Congress members, while others refused to examine the presumptions on electoral fraud of the Democrats.
U.S. State Advocates are assigned to investigate and persecute judicial cases for the government.
They can be released at any time, but they must not be discontinued for political reasons.
At that time, the head of the Ministry of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, was advised on the grounds of the dismissal and in the final effect, set down his office.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also cancelled.
In particular, the report by the General Inspector has criticized the role of Gonzales by carrying the "head Responsibility" for the releases, "resigned" his leadership role and "exceptional interest" in the process
Other officials, including the former principal adviser of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the mediators.
Meat Loafs epical song to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award "Q Award" for his epic "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special golden price next week in London during the award, said he was honored to be acknowledged.
The song, which takes nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
The "Coldplay" launches nominations for the price delivery of this year after it has reached a closer selection in four categories.
The Chieffredacter of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there are some songs that go beyond such matter as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" are certainly one of them.
The song that was written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with a instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song has appeared in the United Kingdom as single in 1979 and has reached place 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loafs "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold itself more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered serious health problems in recent years. One below was an operation in 2003 due to irregular heartbeat after collapsing on the stage.
In 2007 he had to terminate concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
Later he became aware that he had a cyst on his vocal band.
Obscure road in town, often forgotten and perhaps soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, alone, side roads and other roads, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is even difficult for experienced taxi drivers and long-term local residents to say where the extra place is, simply because most of them have never heard of it.
This small road is located in the East Village and walks from the First Street towards the north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching the Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks rather for a dust street than for an actively used transit road.
There are no street signs either.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road plan.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on the First Street.
It wants to plead extra place to create a clean transit to the stores and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other worshipers is the long-term neighborhood that says she is fascinated by the short street, simply because she is one of the remains of the past block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential building and is responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining it.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the City Council this month, representatives of the City Administration and Avalon Bay have designed a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be presented in the next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district responsible in the municipal council 3.
"Only very little space has remained in possession of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to hear the city," she said.
"There could be offers to repair and operate the road what Avalon could do, but we also want public access to remain guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that the small street was re-plying and setting up seats, including for a café to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman from the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the street, but it didn't necessarily want to possess it.
"The main concern of the Avalon Bay is to renovate this fallen street and make a public meeting point," she said and added that the city had proposed the sale itself.
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the building protection department, said it was actually the city's wish to sell the street and stressed that the task of the department should be to develop the real estate rather than to manage.
Compared to his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of his historical impression.
Some believe that in 1802, the road had been named when a large farm, which Philip Minthorne belonged, was divided between his many children and no one claimed a close land.
The rear door of the CBGB music club, the punkrockdenkmal, which was closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is most well known as the picture on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, lumbers and parts of vessels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some inhabitants, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of sale of Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare one – a practically unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled with "The Book of complaints: A bitter nostalgic view of the outdated city"), published a part of the discussion of the city history of Extra Place, published in the "The New Yorker" magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow sack gas that even remains dark in the day and is marked by roasted metal doors of the camp halls, closed windows and at rain runs flying weekly newspapers."
With a few exceptions, the road has looked just as recently on one evening.
A rat walked through the rear part of the street, not far from the door that previously led to the CBGB, where there is a more expensive clothing business today.
Graffiti was seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle was not far from a fresh bunch of ranked newspapers on the ground.
Some passengers said they had rarely thought about extra place, but suggested that the road could be somewhat upholstered.
Fields, added that, in his opinion, some people underestimate the pit of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, moist and idle.
Discussion on two-speaking training: education in English-speaking environment
Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for two-speaking training in this edition of the "Education Watch".
Lance T. Izumi, leader of scientific staff in Kalifonian studies and director of the educational field at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-writer of the book "Not as well as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
The Hispanian voters are a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the probability of afro-American and Hispanic students to complete the school is lower than white students" - what is true.
In order to close this range of performance, Obama's education plan specifically recommends a two-speaking transitional phase in training for those who first learn English.
However, the question to Obama is whether its use for two-speaking training, which focuses on teaching in other languages than English, contradicts his interest to reduce the distance in school services.
For example, "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
Most of the students are hispanic and come from families with low income.
More than one third of the students, many of whom have recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of students of the fourth class had a good level of state testing in mathe.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year were considered well in the English test.
This amazing success was achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on verification and exercise, on steady control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach, according to which training is conducted in an English-speaking environment. This is the point that Obama should observe, according to Linda Mikels school director.
This approach focuses on the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist education.
Ms. Mikels, who refused the idea of two-speaking training, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a pupil who had just come from Mexico. 12 months later, you would be able to enter the classroom and no longer recognize it.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English learning students?
The school's performance would make the answer to this question easy, but the education policy positions within its own party (the national image-uns associations have long been supporting the idea of two-speaking training) and its own consistent support for two-speaking training make predictions on Obama's response uncertain.
While he agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should quit worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close the performance distance, he should take careful account of educational models that work instead of reproaching them and trivializing them.
The oil price decreases as a result of re-evolving concerns for the economy
On Monday, the oil price has fallen strongly because of the fear that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be sufficient to restore the economy.
The raw oil businesses at the New York trade fair fell by 7 percent at $99.80 per barrel during the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulences on the Wall Street and also by strong turbulences in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices in July reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel, they fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month to rise again as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have been concerned again, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan on the weekend, which should be the greatest in history.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far unfinished.
In the first chapter of the growing crisis, the Citigroup, according to a government announcement on Monday, will purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to Analysten at Barclays Capital, despite the excited negotiations that took place on the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it appears that it has not been successful to experience the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to worsen, it is expected that demand for goods, including oil, will continue to fall.
Analysts of the Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors that have become extremely uncertain for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates.
We believe they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned whether the US virus spreads around the world, especially to China."
The bank's analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the next year and reduced their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Indoor defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had been up in the Jets-Trickot in the last eight and a half years more frequently than anyone else.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter in which the Jets transformed a resultless game into a triumph.
"I've never seen something like that," said Ellis.
After a stupid game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard touchdown, this marked the perfect record to a afternoon when their development cooperation made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once spoiled out as an outdoor defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of half time.
"I haven't worked very hard," Coles says about the passport that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
Our vote voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were to catch, the Defense Quarterback Kurt Warner took apart.
Foreign defender Darrelle Revis started an unhappy worm and turned it into a 32-Yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and took off it.
Linebacker David Bowens then provided a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the crazyst.
The Cardinal had conquered the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets robbed the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 Yard shot to 34 to 0 leadership.
These were most of the points that the Jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets, answered "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
To the answers both, because the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without reaching one, Mangini said: "Truest me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time."
Equipped Gebrselassie strikes his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some think of him as the best longitudinal runners of all times after breaking his own record in Berlin Marathon on Sunday and become the first person who has made the distance of 42.2 km in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result from 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Brrselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his diverse career, where he has at least reached a world championship title or set up a world record on every route from one kilometer to the Marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, out of fear that in the afternoon might have been overdriven that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he registered for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the target - Gebrselassie won at a average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per miles.
Since train runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat have changed on long distances from Kenya, the record time for Marathon has fallen for more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his wade two weeks ago and couldn't train a week.
Apparently, he was refreshed after a break and did not come back incurred.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything has been perfectly run.
I've taken the training back a week ago and have had some concerns today, but at the end what's all great."
He was criticized for it - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he was excessively orchestrad his races, many world-best marathon stars generally avoid, rely too much on the race leaders as if it were a railway race, and set world records over the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of breeze as long-distance runners.
Following four Kenians on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the Tempomacher had left.
A little more than three miles ahead of the Finish, Gebrselassie has made his last arrival to separate himself from Kwambai, who has arrived as the second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by nearly 5 minutes.
Kamathi became a third in 2:07:48.
In women Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, completed a considerably year by showing the seventh fastest result of all times at 2:19:19.
The World Record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Britain.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She has missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as back injury. However, she has recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She sent her course by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenian runners ride out, but after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became the second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop arrived in Kenya as a third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the struggles in the life of the black population, in a city of very special kind
Hidden between the outbreaks of the recreational parks in the surroundings of Orlando, a few miles away from the glittering, loud and giant drive, is a quiet city in which the pride and the complications of Afro-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first totally black city in the country and the home city of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three crocket places, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guaves, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville came to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city it describes is and remains – and it made it a tourist destination by taking it into the leader of Florida, which was produced by the Federal writer project at times of depression – in many ways a place of the very special sort.
Eatonville is as independent and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their real thoughts with the white man who "we know so little about us that he didn't know what he was missing."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relations, many are still boring to be watched by outsiders.
"We are very focused on how our story is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a city inhabitant and member of the oldest church in the city.
It must be voted."
Eatonville was defined for a long time as a paradox of the triumph and the battle.
It is a historical example of the black movement as well as a municipality of nearly 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the country average.
On the one hand, it is a highburg of literature and, on the other, an example of - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the southern country, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that inhabitants here are both proud and on guard.
And so right the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as all of us call Hurston.
She presented her home city to the world in books that came from heart and were written in mouthart, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel leader changed the city, which is very close to the route 77, a road that leads through the often forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Frech as Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston readers led to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then went to privater matters.
"Besides the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-witched modern school, with her cared gardens and playgrounds that always care about Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new man of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "Sold drinks of any kind and what-always fit to hours rooms."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston brought Eatonville in connection with self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls devastated the Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about their beauty, full of sexual plays.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
You still remember Hurtson as a lively excentricist who regularly returned after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
August Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston broke into the city, she mostly did this without warning, in a noisy chevrolet, smoking and dressing with hooks, in a city that itself today embraces something on their honorable style.
According to Mr. Franklin, most inhabitants were fascinated, while many despised them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "She never stayed too long," he added while he whispered in his chair, on a backward terrace that looks at the Sabelia Sea, where Hurston was most likely baptized after.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and lost her books.
Together with the vast part of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was attended in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no great Memorial, no public readings in great style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or her inheritance at least," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-stage motorway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-scale main road of the municipality.
Orlando's Vorororte had already pushed the motorway 4 through the west side of the city.
The proposal was presented when Eatonville still recovered from a difficult phase in his history.
Compulsory integration, among other things, had stopped the relative idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial interference brought hatred into the Community.
"During this time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the distant people," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even once a woman who was killed.
They threw a water melon out of the car."
In 1955, Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel asked the Supreme Court to force integration by declaring its decision in the case of Brown against the School Council as "political rather than respecting my race".
People today say that even though the withdrawal of racial separation in some ways was positive, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of its young people.
"Black children were used to be arrogant - I remember it - they embraced his teacher in the morning and hugged his teacher in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be kept upright for so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came out of the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap," said Mrs. Nathhiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for other Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors, and artists who were disregarding prejudices, as they did, with positive self-consciousness and statements like: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went to Hurston's unnamed grave and began to fight for the resurrection of her glory.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway found a very praised Hurston biography in the books, and made it again part of the American literature canon.
The remote road project came just at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter again stood in the public light.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a rescue.
In 1988, the municipality began planning a Hurston Festival to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the motorway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many return to the celebration every January.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-scale remote road experienced the city, accelerated the whole with high speed, awakened real citizen's pride," said Mrs. Natiri.
Ms. Boyd expressed it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more train trips, like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who went to church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past again.
Eatonville was included in the countrywide historical register in 1998.
A new one-piece library (naturally named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly patched and decorated Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still a special feature in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlandos city centre, it can sometimes feel like a hill gas in summer rain, as small as it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black today.)
Outdoors looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a white and representing black men in field work - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a favorite for dark red, still fear that her protected community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time when the Hurston Festival grew, a higher degree of domestic pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither bader nor better and as proud, creative and violent, brilliant and mixed as any other race and nation group in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that you can hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's Neffe, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to the College to Eatonville to work in the city administration or in the police that could use some help according to him.
And even the young people, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven years old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who only go through here will think, "Ach, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on one Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here with us in New York, there's a flower of financial latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspapers and the huge television screens in the Times Square, they would not notice that they are in the middle of a debakel.
They would never believe that on their heads, in the shake-like offices with the glass fibers, bankers and Hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York daily have the worst horror work day since the stockstore in 1929.
The suppliers still push the metal teaweaves along climbing and transporting tablets loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos still swallows between apartments, like human packed animals loaded with around 50 t-shirts, hanging on a yoke-like stain on their shoulders.
Office staff still wait for the climbing dining stations on their breakfast ball and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekly day between 16 and 19 o'clock.
It didn't feel like a crisis until Thursday afternoon, due to all the world's fall, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase family branches, about 20 people were already standing in the snake.
Not to the money switches to cancel or pay money, but to the customer service gadget where family customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to the purchase house of Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, so I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", stood for the same reason as I snake.
Unlike me, however, they had already lifted their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they pened, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had picked up money from so-called Thrifts (a little similar to a building spare), cooperative banks and those local savings banks, which only have branches in one state, and say they treat their customers as a family.
Last year, 15 of these banks have gone quietly and quietly.
During the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went home in bankruptcy management and as the last Friday of the weekend, Wachovia, another bank with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a saver buyer.
In the fear of another crash, the office and shop workers brought their bares before me to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases on Wall Street.
In the last few weeks, the New Yorker has been the most common financial latin.
A woman who phoned in my Chinese tribe supermarket referred with so much confidentiality to Lehman Brothers, the Pleite, and their magnified president Dick Full, as if she were to blaspheme over a foolish colleague.
And Lyn, who is the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my living block, has come from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I have all my savings in money market funds now" she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I'm not going to risk anymore."
Muslim graves violated during Right Ruutsch in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-hand judge of Austria's Austrian Right Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian Right Pertei Vlaam's interest, participate on Thursday, January 17, 2008, in a demonstration in Antwerp to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They wear signs in the style of transport signs on which a mosque is painted, stretched through with a red line.
The police accuses legal extremistes of the digging at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend at the extremely right parties, of considerable profits in the parliamentary election of the country.
In the night of Friday to tomorrow, more than 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in Traun at Linz in an action organized by police.
The killers sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials think this is a attempt to swallow the motive of the extremists driven by hatred to Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way linked to the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said she was "incrediblely shaken" about the message of grave scanning that took place when the religious month of the Muslim Ramadans tends to end.
At the same time, in Austria, a round of conscience research takes place after the country in yesterday's parliamentary election to the right.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far right-right parties received almost 30% of the votes, set themselves in their electoral struggle for a strict anti- immigrant law, and some of their voting rights were criticized by opponents as hostiles.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, used to ban headwears and Burkas and even announced his rejection against food that is generally associated with Islam.
At his last announcement in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarettes with the argument that these political symbols are a continual Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveillance and analysis carried out immediately after the election, which states that the extreme rights of the most politically strong block in the country are, suggest that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel block for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam-Rockstar, who has been sentenced to sexual abuse by children, was legally forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Judges set up a six-month block after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The police in Kent was given it last Thursday to impose a foreign travel block after they presented proofs of Glitter's prejudice for the sexual abuse of children to the judges.
Glitter, right name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Office Court in Kent, but was represented by the Advocate General Corker Binning.
EIn speakers of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police Kent requested the permission of Mr. Paul Glad to prevent foreign trips to France and Spain by 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
According to the register for sexual criminals, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel to abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police seven days before his planned departure.
The absence of notification to the authorities could lead to a five-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said she would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible place of residence in the country.
A spokesman of Kent's police unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"We believe it is easier to control someone who is in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the top concern of the police in Kent to protect Kents' inhabitants and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual criminals in the country to minimise any risk that could be for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse to two girls aged 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he had planned to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him go through the passport control and he fled to Hong Kong after some time.
The Chinese authorities also refused him to enter and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials claimed to return to Britain.
Finally, on August 22, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to Uxbridge's office in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for the approval to require him to register as a sexual criminal.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 because of the possession of pictures of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the Minister of Industry, Jacqui Smith, is calm and satisfied that Glitter was abstained from traveling to France and Spain.
'I get the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.

Artist on the one hand
On the other hand, personality
I look in private life, in these moments that are strange to the audience, I know when I can find the depth of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are worried because they are not going to enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people' the German photographer Günter Bauer represents varied theatralic of some scenarios on the stage with singers, dancers and guitarists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamencoding at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the month of photography of Flamenco, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which grows increasingly from day to day', explains the artist and makes clear that `Flamenco-people' can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to bring passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
To keep the personality of these artists, you don't have to take any photos on the stage.
Her personality and character are in their hearts.
What was interested in me to create a personal atmosphere that would enable me to hold the characters of the biggest flamencomeisters with the photo camera'.
Bauer, inspired by the Festival `Cante de las Minas', took a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the photo sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that remember classic photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical foundation of the image, which gives the image the modernity and idea of the Bauer's understanding of Flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots that change and surprise each day'.
This is not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental game at itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who inspires the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of the hearing, of the Being, was the firm goal of this work that will be presented in the next time in the gallery of the El Fotomata.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the close selection of almost seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became a flamenco anthology and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauers passion for the portraits led him to take this idea again two years ago and to achieve it as 'Portraits of the veterans of sports' ('SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer to `it really likes to photograph the people, to meet them and to put me in their life condition, whether for a short moment or for a long time.
I think that in the field of photography, the portrait is the most difficult generation.
You meet or hit people, personalities that you sometimes don't know, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a picture.
Besides these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas."
The collection of the portraits of the Flamencos of today with the title `Flamenco-people' is issued in the gallery of the El Fotomata, which is located in the street with the name la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hiercules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa acknowledges that the Roma he just writes is 'a interpretation'.
He has not yet known where the act of the Roman is taking place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is trying to continue the project on which he is working, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his attendance at the Festival Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel prize provider admitted that the project with which he was busy is 'a interpretation' and 'all points out that he wouldn't have to write the novel.
"If I had been sensible, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to end the novel at any time," he concluded his participation at the festival where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. In the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities on the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the festival Hay Festival and who most attendees gave their voice, is compared to the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the theatre Juan Bravo.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had a audience before himself, who realized that the Peruan who has a wonderful memory and a great humor feeling had not been given enough time to go through everything again: how his call for literature originated from 'exceptional adventure', from 'Freude at reading' and 'more experienced than before'; how he writes and observes 'Disziplin' in order to complement 'the lack of inspiration' his intense work with documentations, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; as Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his appeals and what' thought images it are, the foundations for his stories.
The hispano-American Roman writer acknowledged that there is no way to measure and how to know whether books change life, 'but I refuse to believe that the literature is pure entertainment, a fugitive experience', stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it is causing 'effects' and 'the people are bringing more apart', so I asked the writers 'do not leave the ease' and 'accept the responsibility' for their calling.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bull fighting fell partly.
After the announced bull fighters discovered that the ground of the place was in bad condition, the bull fighter was placed to finish the festival in Pozoblanco yesterday morning.
Thus, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organiser decided to post the bullet fight festival.
Thus the festival of inconsistent weather was suspended, so two out of three celebrations could not be held.
On Saturday it rained, why the second planned bull fight feast could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días, and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bull fight farena.
So there was only a holiday on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
On the same evening, Alejandro Talavante met two horns and one ear of the bull, which had succeeded him more by galopping than by his bull fighting art.
And even worse was El July, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had fed so badly, a large part of the audience reacted in his second fight with the Buh-Rufen.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand pounds of Hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago ten.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon, Álava.
Two policemen called on the drivers of the car to stop, and then they escaped.
It looked like she had to stop with the load of more than two thousand pounds of Hashish.
The police persecuted them and arrested one of the drivers, the 28-year-old man known as A. A. J., as it announced the Interior Ministry of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and the counterfeiting of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the Transport Police of the region of Álava had already completed traffic controls on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to avoid control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped after a few kilometres on the edge. At the moment, the drivers went out of the car to flee over a land road to a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2.178 Kilo Haschish, which was convicted by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with Hashish bundles, which were later led to precise laboratory analysis and to deviate the bundel to other police offices.
In addition, the officials found that the mark was `doublet', so that it did not agree with the mark specified in the Kfz papers, and there was also a arrest due to the falseing of official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, could flee, but also to determine the origin of the convicted drugs.
The 28-year-old A.A.J., arrested, was brought to a police office for hearing. He is sent to the prisoner in the next hours.
Actor Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The actress Heather Locklear, known by the role of the Amanda from the series "Melrose Place", was arrested in Santa Barbara, California, this weekend for driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
One Witness observed how she was trying to ride out of her parking holes in Montecito in quite strange way, speakers of the Californian Transport Police reported the magazine 'People'.
The Witness told in detail that after 16:30 a.m., Locklear pressed gas pedal and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward out of the park hole, and when she went backwards, she caught her sunglasses a few times.
Sometime later the Witness, who at first probably hadn't known the actor, saw Locklear staying on a nearby road and the car went out.
The Witness was the person who announced the emergency service because she had lived 'ange about Locklears'.
When the police strife came, she found the actress sitting in her car, standing across the street and blocking traffic.
'They seemed to be unoriented', so they brought the police to a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to one police speaker, the actor showed himself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of the officials follow, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medicine', says the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance that could not be determined and brought into a local investigation by nineteen.
Two months ago, after treatment from Arizona, Locklaer was released, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares claims that the United Left Andalusian Association will be responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the chief coordinator of the VL and Members of the United Left, has now assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will take the decision in the case of the former Council of Youth and Sport of the City of Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, which had retired last week after he was accused of making business with family members.
`In such cases I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who must take responsibility for it', Llamazares pointed out the way the party must have to do with the one who sits as a city council in Sevilla's municipal council until now.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the necessity of transparency in the possible investigations of the violations of the rules which Silva might have started: 'The VL was always on the need for such cases to receive maximum transparency.'
With regard to this subject, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de Mayo' represents the revised version of the famous Spanish rebellion against the French. This is a wonderful film in filmography, with about 15 million euros of investment for the rotation work.
In this way, the cineast tried to show "a lot of personalities and social analysis" what he always admired in the works of the famous Roman writer, Carci today explained in the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarria at the beginning of a long list of performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday will be presented in cinema and later shown as a four-hour mini series on the sender Telemadrid.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assured that thanks to this turning work his 'Kindnessstraum' was fulfilled. This was thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who told him three years ago by the autonomous community Madrid to turn a memorial film to the second century celebration in Madrid on November 2nd. Especially because the history was based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the task.
The total contribution of 15 million made by the autonomous community of Madrid for spinning works, as he added, provides Garci the 'individual opportunity' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'confusioned Spain, which chose the false leader for the fight, because the people had been refrained by the fight for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of the VII.
However, the cineast regrets that some scenes from the horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career, could not be rotated with funding like the 'Alatriste' or 'Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as at `Sangre de mayo').
For this reason, Garci, who was also a film director in `Volver a empezar', was involved in his usual work: he appeared 'demütiging' and respectful, 'a part of the profession of the film director is to provide help in the theatre and in the cinema to know what happens in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many performers he hits in `Sangre de mayo' must repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations (which he won one of them), believed and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain in this year before the Academy of Hollywood represent a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor 'Side mesas de billar francés' and finally not the selected film `Los girasoles cigos'.
Garci does not expect awards for this film.
`At the beginning, you think you're working for the offspring, later you notice that it's only for the day, and now you're satisfied if you've produced another movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the dancer from Sevilla Tortola Valencia
A flamen cotton from Sevilla worships a dancer who also comes from Sevilla.
Carmen Tortola Valencia: Her father was Catalane (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and her mother Andalusierin (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in Triana quarter, and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on oriental dances.
She had a thrilling life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, a vegetarian and set up for the elimination of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
Isabel Bayón fascinated the life of this woman who left her traces in the dance and esthetic revolution in Europe during the time between the wars.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role, which seemed impossible to me."
"We don't try to tell about her life without keeping her esprit," said the flamencotäner.
Her dance bases have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, "The dance of the butterfly" seemed like Guajira, or "the dance of the serpent" like Tango.
Her dance was sensible and I was told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area', she claims.
The scenario is composed of two extraordinary cooperations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her ideas, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco-Meister Matilde Coral, who, exceptionally, wanted to work with one of her ex-school women.
`Matilde plays Tortola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored.'
The scenario also covers the musical composition and the guitarists Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the Percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the co-operation with the actor Juanfra Juarez, he's taking over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas, in which he was always in love.'
This work also tells us in a certain way about the life of this woman, which became known in as far as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
"I wanted to call her back in memory, because I think it is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain era and no more of their works today and that is why they know less," says Bayón.
The idea takes place today at 20:30 in the theatre Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York) in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married in 1916 Zenobia offers an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture in order to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The goal is to remember the fiftyth anniversary of the hire of the literature nobel prize and the death day of both.
Thus the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' will be completed with the new edition of this work, with the international convention held in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz' opened in May and, after which it was in various places in Andalusia, now reached New York and presented in the course of the international convention.
The Andalusian Council for Culture also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world dentist more known.
The United States can imagine badly without Paul Newman
`Many times God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in `Sensationsreporter', and from the then dominant idea of the U.S.-A. cinema, which was left behind, came from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed her.
Look what she cost him to give him to the Oscar.
And when he went back in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, this was a big hit for everyone.
"What a person sometimes feels is much more than a expression, and now I have lost a great friend," said Robert Redford crying, "my life and my country were the greatest foolishnesses of his life."
Nobody was afraid not to be ridiculous or to overcome.
As a "father" of the cinema and the fatherland, he died in a sad moment of fear of terrorists and of market collapse, where the defeated self-value feeling of the US Americans is on the hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue just a few people you can admire, you don't necessarily need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For everyone he characterized a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as different losses both gains: from the foundation that prescribed the fight against drugs and to honor his son from the first marriage, who died of overdose, was founded to the own brand of homemade and organic products.
All of this is a gift for the country in which it cost him much effort to strive against a deadly diet culture.
A wide wave of surprise struggles haushoch over Hollywood without respect for nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, an English Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize manager, said that the work with Newman was no more or less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to describe Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"We have left the biggest of all of us," confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of a few who are trying to live today like Paul Newman: getting high demands for justice, leading a responsible private life, far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there's someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities to be.
"Why should I eat a Hamburger on the street if I have Filet at home?" he often screwed himself.
In heaven he will be proud that his daughters on earth have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily usual in America.
"From all the great roles he played, on no one he was as proud as on those of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive opa and the Philanthrope," they say.
For the Olympic Games, the streets in Madrid are lacking.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organise some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I ask myself, 'Is we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not true!
She was referred to as a perfect road, and according to my assessment, she was the worst road with all that was there.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you would observe the evaluation and I could examine it, that would clearly not have been done.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pickup that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you do, they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid the steam on the street).
Well, don't.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists of going there only for that reason) and (after an infinite snake) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size of XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it true that after the crisis, only small, much cheaper shirts were decided to buy from less material?
Well, things like these are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Besides that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, also, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was expected, the road began and we hadn't left our backpacks behind it, even if it had once succeeded, but it would be more difficult to recover.
In addition, it looked like in these 40 minutes of waiting for rain, so it came to the temptation to organise a people’s rebellion and to overcome the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people with lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear in time at the classification because of this chip I have received, I can think that the output has been falsely stamped.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, this road would never hit me.
So I think we're going to dream of a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', organised by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image identification system and the human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, it is a route planner to move on the company's campus). The system observes what it hears during the entertainment.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face identification system, these `receptionist' can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also include the attendants after the discussions in the groups.
In the presentation video `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that leads to her conversation, and that neither is a business employee.
She asks if the person wants to visit someone here and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example, on the next version of its operating system Windows.
This week it was very superficially spoken about Microsoft's strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that will be just for the few.
Everything is only one finding if you think that Microsoft in Windows versions added some function and 'Extras'.
The change of direction is worth it
The Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses of importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrom appeared in the network, it was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Well, many pointed out that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an essential part, will always be necessary to allow hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared with the function of his wife or his husband when it comes to telling his mother and sister something.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of your 'Death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
Every time people pay less attention to the operating system, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the explorer or chrome and we spend more time on surfing every day than in the surroundings of the 'window'.
What does half of the computer use existing applications?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Easyer, not so overly, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In fact, they need that, without any doubt, I give a little example of it.
I made the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the resting rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshment drinking machine, a sign is mounted: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online searching.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees used Microsoft, Google for the research in the network.
By the way, last week also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the brand at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'The Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to the clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we start counting the countless stars performances, we can return to the picture of a very powerful man, with a spit bart that had raised heavy weight in a hiking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, armelless and taillated.
The English speakers call it 'tank'. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, however, exceeds all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although it is called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the name form is connected to sports and is derived from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' overlooks all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinct Unisex cutter, and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (coverable) that these T-shirts have as details at the neck cut.
And respect, the Belgian company is not just focused on the production of `tanks'.
You also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kashmire, Hosen made of cotton, T-shirts with stripes, babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very harmful to use it as underwear.
You're very exciting.
'I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is delicious, but full of life's joy.
Currently, the sisters Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of Mango's company, departing then her residence and also making the presentation of the most important premiums in the fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of 'Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner to Valentino's honors.
A very intense working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis for your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I'm pleased to go through a city and watch women dressed as they combine their clothes, which I often do.
Dancing, actor and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, right?
I believe yes, but finally, everything happens in one, and these areas have many commonties.
Since I was young, I was enthusiastic of the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to get around my aunt’s garments and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to a recreational park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to watch the clothing.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in lessons and at the samples to look into the mirror and feel good about it.
As actor, when you get the costume, you're going into the real performer's role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so much respect for the costume designer and their professionality.
You just got 30 years ago, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh, yeah.
I feel better than ever, than thirty-year-old, I feel good.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I've done the things I've been trying to do since I was young, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So, you're thinking about being a mother, right?
For a long time I have known that I will be a mother because that demands my body and also I want to be a young mother; I don't want to let it go.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
I will give my child great happiness and raise it with much love.
With regard to the art of film, you keep in mind the work you have participated in and the last year have been rotated.
That's the way, and I really want them to be presented to the public.
As a woman who comes from the theatre, I am very impatient and uncomfortable and want to have everything at once that, of course, cannot be immediately.
I very much wish `La última hora' and 'A busca de la tumba de Cristo' are listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A few days ago you appeared on the runway with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not that I went on the runway to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has simply called and invited me to London to participate in a parade for the welfare event of her organization "Women for a better world" and the clothing we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for Mango were increased to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There's a lot of things going to tell you about her, and I'd tell you, as the one she knows, that they don't vote.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a handjob, I will do that too.
In order to support women in the Third World, whatever is necessary.
The drivers who can be relapsed because of the alcohol level will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The Authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties because of the alcohol level, installs in his car of this system, which prohibits him to start the car in drunk state. If he is alcoholized, then the car won't jump.
The initiative has already been announced in June last month and is now part of the General State Prosecutor's report.
The aim is to re-sociate the driver, which is why he receives a course for the reconstruction of traffic behaviour.
Except for the General State Attorney, experiencedly, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers who had been shown more than once because of the influence of alcoholic drives, returned to taxation.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents autostart when the driver has made alcohol tests; or if a alcohol concentration is detected higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1,000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who is penalizing the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices already prevent up to 65% of the rules infringements in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 human lives could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative penalties for two reasons: to attack this behaviour before it becomes a crime.
And in order to facilitate its implementation, a legal reform can be realized in the usual way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required for the criminal prosecution process.
The device is still available on the Spanish markets, in no business, although it has already been built in some of the public transport vehicles and vehicles.
As a result of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, will be voted in the House.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With British punctuality at 17:40 p.m., at the time planned by the program, next to the presidial hangar of the Benito Juárez de México DF landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with the prince and prince of Asturia.
The sun went down, but its radiation has still forced to use the hand as a sunscreen to see the royal couple that went out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturia visited the city to formalize the official journey.
- Oh, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time you're from here or something.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she's been living here for a few years.
- Aye, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and prince of Asturia is and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who wait in the Hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, also military protection of 27 Marine soldiers who give honor salve.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the prince, with long-weighted hairs, without normal `peep-toes', may have been told that a thunder is expected in DF.
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official sequence is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are placed, one of the four largest in the city, awaiting a reporter from the Mexican television that likes to make fun.
The best premium of the fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no very excellent fashion designer and Bonvivor than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a money price of EUR 300 000.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first issue, last night saw her drawings in the Mango branch window on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost wept because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
So many events have happened that you want to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his jurisdiction in competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the area of many famous people, the board, organized by Mango, seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart broken by pain, because his brother recently died, ripped together. He attracted the suit from the fashion house and had some jewelry of ELAH, who were breathtaking. He stayed at the arm of his son Luis, who was nearly two meters large and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, to his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the house Mango, greeted the guests and was thus a cavalier, so that he ended with the baron of red shield without jacket, for jacket's they borrowed the women.
Mónica Cruz, hastened to the business and had a shirt and a shirt that she modeled herself, and at the dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was excited, remembered the old times, took a stange and made a kind of `grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace's spatials, but before she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were pleased about the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always creates a stormy enthusiasm, and on Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with his own bed cottages and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, in advance asked to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starful sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Rate against stress
There's not 1000, but a way more to forget chaotics to forget us fast everyday life.
And if there are few, all are gathered in a book in which it stands how to relax. The book comes to the books on September 30th.
The Wecker is a punishment when he sounds at 7:00 a.m., but even worse the idea of coming back into the hectic rhythm, which demands the current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to fight daily exhaustion and the problems that are being dismantled from the working world.
The number increases, however, no longer and not less than 1001.
In addition to Yoga performances, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book represents the entire list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against stress is `1001 opportunities to relax' and the rest that gives the book comes into the book deals of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Whoever thinks it is impossible to reach peace in areas such as work through personal contacts, this manual rejects such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenalin in your Venes no longer rises up to restore the body's balance and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Speaking in Sleep
Some children talk at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be scared, but in reality it doesn't matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder, which is called the talk in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you was told that you were talking at night.
This phenomenon may occasionally occur (one time in life, such as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no reason to cause this appearance.
Often associations are searched with other appearances in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (bed nosses at night), talk in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we have mentioned earlier, it may be very high fiber, stress situations, or excessive.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper or it can be quite a opposite (shouting, wines, long discussions).
In cases where the statement is very intense, it is recommended that the child be monitored and consulted with a specialist to verify whether there is a problem that causes fear and thus arises.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with the sleep-apnoe or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple prevention measures:
Do not try to excuse the child before sleeping.
So, choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children to whom relaxation is recommended, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child sleep quietly.
When the talk occurs in sleep, then the rest is trying to keep.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will be able to remember nothing that has happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will rip it out of sleep.
Though the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it appears scary after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to be advised or to find out the reason for the child’s fear.
When they understand what it says (which is not so common), the child does not put pressure on the child to conduct a hearing and to get more information.
You will not be able to do this because when the child sleeps, it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says that they are cautious with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you hear that night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that's just a few minutes.
Illhouses ... ultimately
After a long thirst line, Illhouses on the field are finally back on a success course.
Without a great effort, the yellow blacks played many torchances and managed to implement one of them and thus win the game.
The pace of this meeting, when the attackers were struggling to show their ability, was not very high.
After a first attack of the champion Kauffmann, whose distance shot was close to the angle, Illhouses should dominate the game with easyness, and there was a different fonderflick with a remote shot, then a brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the footstep to demand Denmark's restraint.
The opposing team blocked in the field center and left only the living Riahi on the tip of the storm.
The beginning of the second half-time should be decisive with two torchances that were first struggled by Riahi and Temporal, and immediately afterwards with the first gate for the Illhouses by Marais, who was exactly right to accept a ball again, which had been resisted by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the ill domestic gate protector should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about 12 minutes later, making his teammates have to continue to play countlessly lower.
However, Denmark did not use this and did not face any major problems of an ill-haeusian elf, which just went a little back to 'decorate' their defense, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball went very close to the lat.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another abdomen to the Bretagne.
In view of the determination of the fishermen who blocked access to several British and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to find himself in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives there.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hoped that he would come with 'concrete proposals'.
The visit of the President will take place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee established by the British fishermen to implement measures in the light of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which has reached an average record value of over EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to the press speaker of the Elyséepalast David Martinon, the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again and to ensure the working conditions and the payment of the sailors.
Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with determination.
Thursday morning, they brought protests in Morbihan and Calvados, which caused Staus of nearly ten kilometres of length.
Quiberon's sailing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not interrupt.
The Quiberon Peninsula was cut off with a locker.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning from the early morning on tyres and pallets before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement was devoted to other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the arc channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the cattle did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvre of trade vessels.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique solved in the evening the blockade of the major total refinery in Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec crisis committee must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the representatives of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
'The strike will continue' because 'the fishermen will not give up at any point' and 'will not go to Paris', for example, announced Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on Diesel are currently costing about 50 cents, but they believe that the profitability limit of a boat can only be achieved with diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable performer from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 by the consequences of cancer in his house in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes, adopted by Paul Newman, who died in 83 years of age.
Embraer holds its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer calculates this year 215 aircraft delivered, despite the threatening recession, as a danger for the world economy.
Embrer, the fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, maintains its delivery forecasts for 215 aircraft delivered in 2008, its president Fredrico Fleury Curado confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much from the Chinese market, especially for its planes of size range from 30 to 120 seats.
Until today, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider deducting more than 15% of their assets
According to the Sunday Edition of the Financial Times, the Insurer American International Group, who was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, considers to spend more than 15% of its assets in order to pay back the 85 billion dollars that were proposed to him.
AIG is ready to charge the sale of a large part of its businesses, beyond their international life insurance and their age care in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG met Sunday evening to verify possible sales.
AIG could not be confirmed.
One of the assets of which AIG might divorce is their plane-leasing International Lease Financial Corp., their share of 59% of Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate and investment in Private Equity, the FT continues.
With regard to these sales no final decision was made, the FT continues.
AIG has to do the sales fastest to pay back the loans over 85 billion that it has granted to the Federal Reserve, even to the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and lose the current shareholders in the same way.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical Morning Meeting
The New York Börse reported on Monday, after the Board of Representatives had rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historical case of courses: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of nearly 800 points, and the afternoon 9.14%.
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777,68 points to 10.365,45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) had been recorded earlier on 17 September 2001, the day of trade decline after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final discount figures, the index afternoon, mainly on technology, decreased by 199,61 points to 1.983,73, and the widespread index standard&Poors 500 by 8.81% (106,85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
Following the unexpected refusal of the bank rescue plan by the Chamber of Members, which should allow some stability on the markets, the Wall Street collapsed, which had already been attacked at the beginning of the quarter.
By 228 votes and 205, the Members refused the financial secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Almost two of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"Here is brought a bad picture in circulation that represents the Congress incapable of adopting a plan," said Lindsey Piegza by FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days 'come too late'.
`If the project is actually condemned to fail (...), it will be a quick task of the Fed (American Central Bank, Ann. d. Red.) and other central banks to tackle the crisis, which would limit the credit conditions even more', Brian Bethune, economic manager of Global Insight warned.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, with more emphasis on the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day that spreads, brings the ruin of a financial company' in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned the purchase of the banking shops of Wachovia by its competitors Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and led to emergency measures for banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, an indication that the markets are not just a American but a global crisis, the analyst of FTN Financial added.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
Within ten years, the revenues of the state fund have decreased from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening, and revenues from 4.161% to 4.357% within 30 years last night.
Obama, winner by points in the first television doll
At the first debate of the two candidates for the White House from Friday another one followed to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory for the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats in this television doll, which should be persecuted by a third of the American families.
Political Analytics David Gergen appreciates that John McCain's performance, although it was quite pleasant, was not brilliant enough to allow him to stop his decline in the elections five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, of which a question of opinion was published on Saturday, according to Obama with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the democracy clearly makes the better figure.
Obama showed 39% as a winner of the surveys, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% of them see McCain as winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his precursor on Thursday with the good performance expected by his fellow candidate Joseph Biden at the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin,
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts, but warn Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not stop bringing its uncontroversial experience in the field of foreign policy to the forefront, and thus clearly underlined the 'Naivity' of his opponent regarding these issues, which were the central point of this first television doll.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he stressed several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to become President," he also assured.
A attack point that has been preached in the Republican electoral spots since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represented the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without having to get out of the version.
He put his ability to make good decisions and to renew the picture of the world from the United States.
`McCain has still not understood, however, Obama', put this weekend a democratic electoral spot on the other hand, in which the Republicaner was precluded not to have recorded the complete extent of the crisis, which lasts on the 'American from the road'.
"During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama pranged up yesterday before 20,000 people who had gathered in a electoral event in North Carolina in a streaming rain.
He did not even mention the words 'meeting' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis creates Obama, which the Americans consider the most suitable to save the economy even on the edge of the base, a clear advantage.
'The next week could be a crucial turning point', appreciated yesterday by the impressive democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton Government, compared the "good economic instinct' Obamas" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of a eight-year poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After again stressing that he might even be able to reduce the taxes for 95% of the Americans despite the fluctuations on the Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energetic independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, has a priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to create a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates are deliberately devoted to the questions on the plan to save the financial market more than 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was adopted by the Congress yesterday evening and is extremely unwelcome in the people.
"Have you noticed that there was a choice in Minsk?"
Youths and oppositions demonstrated Sunday evening at the headquarters of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of Parliament's elections in advance.
A few hundred Whites gathered Sunday evening since the closure of the elections on the marketplace of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of parliamentary elections.
Although no result had been announced, many youths had come to demonstrate against Alexander Lukachenko's power: 'The dictator should go back'.
Some admit that they haven't chosen at all: 'What's helpful if they do with my voice what they want,' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown foreign observers in the best light to restart negotiations with the European Union, is ready to carry out a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-division of visa for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the pursuit of certain assets, could be repealed if these choices were estimated as clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
`We were excluded from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the exhibition', regreted Juri Potemkin, the press speaker of the Union's democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkievitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the Pro-Europe movement, because it is important who tells the voices, and with us this is the executive.
If Members of the Opposition enter Parliament, then because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into Parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
The opposition is therefore guilty of emigration into the political game, because the dialogue with the European Union needs to be opened.
For if our economy, which is strongly guilty of Russia, is in crisis and we do not reform, we are at risk of being a protectionate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the European Security and Cooperation Organization, which has pursued the elections, does not recognise the election as valid.
It emphasizes that the number of participants appears too high and that the extension of the voting levy in advance (26% of Minsk's voters) has given the way for any kind of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that a choice took place?" asked the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released in August this year.
No one was in the electoral rooms.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the Opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to meet the government's ideas. '
The silence of the night is falling again over the October Square.
On television, President Lukachenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Discussion - From blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday on the 10th anniversary of her foundation, and her President, Dr. Francine Décary, had all reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the most secure and efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she gained the confidence of the public, which was severely shaken by the scandal of the infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the dissatisfaction of the public, the Canadian Government launched a public investigation conducted by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994, aimed at bringing light into the circumstances which had led to such a tragedy and developing directives to prevent a new disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever still hesitated to submit his report, several provinces then put a committee on the legs, whose aim was to develop a new system for the management of blood conservation in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood company to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec took up their work, only 38% of the people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
By the huge efforts to improve the safety of blood conservations and through the work in this field during the following years, we have won back the public', she says, before proudly stressing that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, maintains in consciousness that 'confidence is something extremely fragile'.
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has acted in accordance with the principle of caution.
At that time, we experienced the appearance of many cases of the human form of cattle wound in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, this woman, who has been headed since the foundation of 1998.
`And we didn't have the least idea if this disease could be transmitted over the blood.
So we are calling for one of the main directives of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which, according to the use of exclusion measures, if you do not know this, and if a disease is slowly progressing, as it is obviously the case with the Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was accepted from people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt, it was proven that this disease is transmitted over the blood.
So this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has quite a sense.
In 1999, a much more precise technique appeared on the market to detect HIV: the nuclear acid tests (NST), which enable the virus itself to prove directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used before.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time the person was infected and when the first viruses can be demonstrated in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it and you could not recognize this was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via blood transfusion.
Today, one out of 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV - infected blood.
`In other words, it means that you have to distribute 12 million blood conservations before someone was caught with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood conservations every year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs where HIV was transmitted via a blood conservation.
I think that you can feel well today when you get or write a blood transfusion to restore health, says the head of Chef of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You don't know what disease viruses can get into the system.
Only last year on the island of Réunion the Chikungunya virus appeared, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We need to monitor without interruption', Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec also needs to provide an adequate supply in addition to a secure supply.
`The need is growing because the population is ageing.
As treatments for cancer are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which averages only 3% of Quebec's inhabitants suitable for blood donation. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years old or older and fulfils suitability criteria can spend blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
By average, 14% of the people who make their blood available are not accepted because they are ill, for example, AIDS or malaria, and those who have travelled to a country where malaria is spread, are excluded from blood donation for one year.
`With these 3% we can get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Missing stocks are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network if they get older and donate no more blood.
It is hard to convince people to spend blood, but especially to keep them and to bring them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour on blood donation', Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conservations, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heartburns, eyelaps, and skin, which are almost exclusively used for severe burning injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public navel blood bank of Quebec.
In the Nabelsnur, which was previously considered biomedical waste, there is a rich blood stem cells that can serve to treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
`A few weeks ago, we celebrate the imaging of our thousandth most navel blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand a year.
`We should probably start by making it available for transplantation at the beginning of next year', Dr. Décary continues, who describes this program of nailsnurblood reduction as very popular.
'Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it' because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in halffinal
Montreal's Impact took place yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all gates) against the sounders from Seattle at the second and chose the game of the quarterfinal series in the Saputo city, where the total tower ratio included, qualified for the half-final round of the extinction games of the first League of the USL.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the ninety-minute game.
After a first half time without a gate for both the one and the other, the middle field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other matches for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who took Matt Jordan in the way for the sounders.
Remember that at the first game of the previous and back-up series on Friday Impact had brought a 2 to 1-down to the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a premise of Seattles.
In the halffinal Impact will measure with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening Thunder was able to compensate a 3 to 1 deficit in Minnesota through a 4 to 3 victory, but the Whitecaps still moved into the semi-final round with a total tower ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series are defined today.
Shortly said - Victory by Kovalev
The number 1-Trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Last evening, the unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn cast forward the attack on the Panther from Florida with a stormfire, which led to a 3 to 2 victory.
Costitsyn, the star of the meeting, shot a gate, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a pass in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only gate of all the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game so I can feel. '
Guy Carbonneau noticed that he had too much to do with it during the first half time.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a stormy applause. '
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude opening elections before the end of the year.
Once the General Assembly of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tried to be elected in today's partial elections.
`Move the course of our last large border in the north: this is the long-term goal Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following all the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of image mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular pictures of water power plants, mines, from Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Great funds as during the election period.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister refused to exclude the elections of this autumn, even if he had to say that his appointment calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision' which the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, namely a 'new economic area', which provides an agreement with France on labour force, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although she has been frequently mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister in recent times, the opening of the north - the northern area on the 49th width degree - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister confined itself to explain why the north is a jewel with enormous potential, but did not mention any date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
Most of a few views on what could be done more: especially in the water energy sector, in the forest, but especially in the mining sector, the growth of the threshold countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charest's listing, the north `Nickel, Zink, Copper, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Iron, Titan, and even Diamonds'.
This area is twice as large as France' is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not only near us, it's in us, he stressed how to clearly show that he is seeking a national founder's dream to achieve.
Quebec has grown very through its connection with the north, he stressed: the road to the gold in Abitibi, the technology of Quebec, the James Bay.
'It belongs to us, it is our future', he added after he had put a theatrical break in order to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always invited, explained to the press Prime Minister.
`This is a traditional attitude that followed all governments.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is offered, I will take this attitude again on behalf of the government', he explained.
In addition, 'with climate change we have to reconsiderate our vision from the north', he explained and spoke about the Northwest Passage, which will be possible throughout the year due to ice melting.
In view of this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes it is just a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the region, the inhabitants, and the inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would deal very carefully with them and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pecastic Member of Ungava) have already launched discussions in about thirty communities.
A Ministerial Committee, directed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Bodenschätze) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large congregation, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity for 'to create a common vision'.
On the other hand, the development of the north will be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be 'recommended, regulated and environmentally rewarding', he promised.
Jean Charest described this "Vision" as if it were a continuation of the liberal Prime Ministers who were in office before him.
`As the Liberals who were in front of us, we have thought about to transform the challenges into new growth and development changes.
This was, by the way, one of the repeatedly raised topics of the weekend, opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party lead by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted is to rename the power plant of Beauharnois to Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
"Von Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about reading that has reached the silent revolution and the state of water electricity, to Bourassa, who has made the James book, always knew our party to determine the future," explained Jean Charest.
He was referring to another conservative project this time on the program 'Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Mr. Charest stressed that its operation was planned for 2012 as regards the Water Power Staudam Eastmain1a-Ruper project.
"This remains among us, but I'm inclined to be with," he trusted his party members, what was the result of those coincidence storms.
The Prime Minister who said in April that there would not be any elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has in fact not yet excluded the possibility of keeping this autumn a choice that is possible from the law.
He emphasizes, however, that his calendar is full, especially because of a mission of the Community Council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend gave the Liberal Party Chairman a platform of nationalist plans, in particular from 'the Constitution' objectives, which were adopted without delay: the PLQ calls particularly for the recognition of the 'Speciality of Quebec' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the Nord Plan were taken with skepsis.
The Chief of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, reaffirmed the policy on the development of the Nord-du-Quebec, which the Government introduced Landry in 2001.
According to you, the liberal government, when she came to power in 2003, did not apply it.
If she had done it, we were already much further today, Ms. Marois judged on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has voted in favour of supporting the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that this is not just a big idea," said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justiz' minister (what irony) in the Harper cabinet was the one who allowed her last summer to say about Louise Arboro that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has led a non-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with smash, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister, as about Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do with a government that, as the only one out of all the countries concerned, has not taken her landsman captured in Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things were happening to him.
The only government, who, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, breaks her word and lets a child soldier get away under inhuman conditions.
The only one who turns down to a court parodie to assess the guilt of the accused person.
Let us remind ourselves that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers are pleasing to get Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair process in Canada.
Exactly this government also closes the eyes before torture: it is little of interest that after so many years of suffering a young adult will certainly have been emotionally broken forever.
We are not aware of this yet, but we are just experiencing a foolish circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'Democratic', this word that Harper is constantly carrying forth like a flag, and that sounds so necessarily out of his mouth.
So the time has come in which there is no more morality: you may randomly mistreat, torture and lock a Canadian citizen, according to the good thoughts of a Head of Government, which is only supported by the minority until today (may be part of the minority all after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party preaching virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has disregarded the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this discharge, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellic Talk of Barrick Gold
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and follows an orwellic logic that the world's largest gold-producing society aimed to open a "public transparent debate" for more than six million people against three authors and a small, medium-sized publishing house.
If it is true that the judges are independent and unpartial, they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of blasphemy, but in the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely weakened by Mr Garver.
For Barrick Gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, to drive everyone in ruin, who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter what the process goes out, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very uneven weapons against a army of lawyers who are paid out of the almost inexhaustive bags of the gold mine.
The tactics in these uneven fights are often to ruin the defendants in order to force a unanimous arrangement that makes the opposite to death and also disappoints anyone who dares to reconsider the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had to present her view of things before the public opinion.
In contrast to what is happening in many of the countries in which Barrick Gold works, debates are usually carried out in Canada by exchange of ideas and not by knee.
So it would be enough if the gold mine had opened their books and documents and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent test teams that could have brought light into this question.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in the public opinion and wears the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he at the same time can ask for a 'public' debate and do not disregard the opinions of this public?
Apparently, this word in the world of the Vice-President includes only the generously paid lawyers, not the community of all Canadians; a rather degraded view of the term.
In a democracy, even lieutenants have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public, who supports Noir Canada's authors and publishers, does this especially because it refuses the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen to and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many are aware of as a knee-clash (Barrick Gold just claimed to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they demand that they no longer use this term...).
In addition to Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's complaint is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth finding, which is fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely denys the right to quote critical sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of this world, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The universitary environment we belong to has long been able to handle debates and disagreements and solve conflicts.
The unproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, in contrast to what it suggests, it does not like a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the universal world, as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures that restrict this kind of unjustified complaints.
Rescue Action for the Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The administration of Bush and the Governing Congress Members, Republicans and Democrats, finally agreed yesterday on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan over 700 billion dollars to stop the financial crisis, which has been shaking the Wall Street for months, has still to be adopted by the two convention chambers.
The main content is: a better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money used, new facilities to reduce the number of houses occupied by payment reserves, and the right to monitor the salaries paid to the managers of the supported companies.
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Nancy Pelosi Chamber, and the representatives of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective," said the representative of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson.
"It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis at Wall Street," said the Democrat.
"This is the basic point: if we do not, the dream, the chaos and the disturbances in the daily lives of the Americans will be enormous," explained the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, because of the fear of the effect that had a re failure on the timing of investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part in the negotiations first lately, proved more favourable to the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction about the need to meet them in this extreme way.
The democratic senator Barrack Obama was on the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, especially those that would enable owners to keep their homes and those which concern the salaries of the executive employees of the companies rescued by the State.
`If you ask the taxpayers to take extraordinary measures due to the unanimity of certain persons, that is nothing that you can congratulate on.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on the American television broadcasters.
When he was asked on another sender if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: "I would only like to know the details, but I hope it.
`The lines I have read show that this is one thing that we will all have to dignify, and with which we will be able to come forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis, caused by placing a real estate leasing, leading first to the collapse of risky hypocrisy credits (subprime) before extending to other forms of more widespread loans (PCAA), and finally in a freezing of financial power and in the ruin of banks and monetary institutions.
A group of Republican Members was to fail the first attempt to agree last week.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of the societies should only be secured and not purchased by the government, it is believed that the sackgasse is escaped.
In order to round off the perspective for all in the Congress, one has also added an opportunity that, if the government had to make losses with this programme within five years, it would then be able to raise new taxes to retain its used capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which can be added to another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The further 350 billion payments must be adopted by the Congress in a new vote.
On the contrary, Washington receives shares in the supported companies who bring in dividers in the case of profits and which can sell it again when the storm is over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the pleasing procedures relating to the housing bound by the real estate credits affected by this plan and also set deadlines for the refund and the remuneration paid to the executive employees of the undertakings concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber to vote on it today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday further votes against this project, both the Republicans and the Democrats.
"Of course Washington doesn't understand us," said the Republican Scott Garett, member of the Chamber's Financial Commission, his voters.
`Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are to ask the taxpayers for the cash.
The democratic Member Brad Sherman, head of a group in the Congress called 'the Caucus of Skeptics', represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Vier hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize Professors, have written us to inform us: We ask the Congress not to be put under pressure and carefully consider the way to go," he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we again received evidence in Europe that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced that the Banking Group for Fortis was partly negotiated for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank announced GDP Paribas that she would stop buying her competitor in great difficulties since she lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in the crisis by the risky real estate credits in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and belongs to the twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
'This is not a lost money, said the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we receive a right of choice and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the sparers and households appreciate, now that uncertain times are announced. '
During this time, the British government was about to necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily necessarily transpose another bank brought by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take all ongoing loans at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British Government has had to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an committed icon
His beauty with the azur blue eyes was his trumpet for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Did the American actor free himself from the narcissist mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His fine feeling, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly horrible monsters to the world.
But what a big runner!
On Friday, 83 years of age, Paul Newman died from lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of the golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, which he was similar to and for which he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his play, surely also more crushed, but equally an apostle of freedom and the explosion of dramaturgic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jews and a Hungarian mother.
From its European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream should arise.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality characteristics.
For in him a whole country, which was in love with the Self-made-man, was reflected in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War, who studied in Yale at the beginning of the 50s and then visited the Actor's studio in New York before he had success in the theatre, on television and soon in the cinema.
Eleven of this man, who struggled for civil rights, was also the driver who became at the 24-hour race of Man's Second in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a predecessory relationship with the actor Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, restraining, engaged, and against the glamour of the show business oversensitive stars, whose puzzle will never be completely solved.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death moved the cinema lovers to Taumel this weekend, while all his great roles were played on the dark screen of the memories.
More than a half-century American film art in constant change moves over with it.
Then the charming Cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) is reminded, and the young man, who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) to The Cat on the hot blechdach, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memorial (1990) will be awakened to his sensible Mr. Bridge, who is disturbed by a wedding in his high age, which did not fulfill all of her promises.
So many other Paul Newmans were in history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable Boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A hand full of asshole) by Robert Wise, a role that was thought for James Dean, was restarted after his death and made the Newman right known in 1956.
This sympathic Ganove in the surprising The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and racial billard player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rosen (1961),
This face through the times, he was.
He's still there.
In his lifetime, epochs unite themselves.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox trainer of an iceockey team.
His fans found him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen.
With a last role in 2003 as the father of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several cinema-leadings who have taken away early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, including Hollywood, his assets, his prunk and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'Underplaying' when he assessed his excessive performance.
The metier wasn't always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, which the rolls just floated for a long time.
He, however, played rarely Sunnyboys as an outsider: Neurotiker, alcoholic, fies, or desperate, with which he reflected his distraction and rebellion.
As director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true sensitive sensibility.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the Roman of Canadian Margaret Laurence) and his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the main role, was drawing a fine-suited women's portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, devoted his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of fine feeling and sadness.
During the flood of honors, which took place yesterday on Newman, his close friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) very much: 'They's presence has improved my life and this country.'
generosity and joy in life were essential characteristics of the dead actress.
Apart from his legendary career, a great defender of civil rights, the protection of the environment and the independent cinema, a opponent of Hollywood's deployment, is now going away.
We may have often seen him with the foot in shells full of vineyards, in sauces, bags or other foods, and this was quite tasteless, although we found it fun at first.
The profits of his sales were still flown into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman engaged to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: 'Always and until the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. '
And for us it was an honor to be allowed to pursue the life of such intelligent and generous American actors.
An excellent citizen, in the closest and in the most widespread sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory of supplement &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against Jáno's supplement and its complicities begin.
Participation in organised crime and gross harmful harmfulness and business fraud and other criminal acts, including document falseity, is presumed to the accused person.
According to the State Advocate General, the appropriations accrued from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often carried out with false accounts.
State funds and subsidies from self-administration - total HUF 65 million - are to be partly floated into the Fiatal Baloldal Organization, partly into individual private funds.
As the investigation authorities announced, fictional accounts were submitted in the reference of tenders and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to charges, most of the accounts should have been faked.
The booklets were bought on the market by Jozsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the accounts are to be issued was decided on the round trip north of the plate sea to which Isván Lados was sent by Jáno's supplement.
During this "exploration tour" Lados should find out pensions and restaurants.
He demanded bills on consumption to be able to post on these accounts on the basis of the Youth and Sport Ministry, the Social and Labour Ministry, and the self-administration of Budapest.
These accounts should have been manipulated by the majority of Isván Lados and his complicator, and the latter should have been responsible for the Constitution of the relevant reports, according to our information.
One of the goals of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer room.
As two accounts issued by grants and Co in 2003, the gastronomy company should have advocated the ninety-found group of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
Now, however, the head of the company indicates that such a large group would not have fit into the local at once.
Another invoice, issued in summer 2002 on the Foundation Jobb JövÃért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also showed grave form and content errors.
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can not stay more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests should have stayed.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was apparently not set any limits as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy company in which the accounting documents of the customers Jobb JövÃért and Hoppá according to the charge authority do not even appear.
As the Executive Director Gyžz _BAR_ Farkas announced the hvg.hu, he immediately realized that it was a false document when the prosecutor had submitted documents to him during a survey.
"Our company name and the tax number were incorrect on the stamp."
And further: Besides form errors, the fact was wrong that the operation should have accommodated a hundred people after they have a total of eleven rooms that are impossible to offer so many people room.
It has also been said that the restaurant has no longer been operating for a long time.
The emsensive accounting counterfeiters have also refused to verify that the Budapest Travel Office, which they took on their views, offers exclusively travelling to abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary travel on the cash payment account, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As has been known in the course of the investigations, they have also added VAT on the accounts, although travel office services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The total amount of VAT was incorrect on four accounts issued to the Foundation Jobb Jövért, since the company, instead of 25, accounts for only 15 per cent of VAT, is also exclusively issued by the employees, but the false documents were handwritten.
Another error that had been undertaken by the "reservation" was that in a case of "war transport" they had specified the performance provided, although this is not offered by the company specialised in investment consultancy, the state lawyer informed.
Further form errors - false accounting format, false stamp - were due to the facts issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Cultureális Egyesület and Biztos Pont as falses.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehérto, whose managers insisted that they never had to issue the accounts.
Another "fellow" is undergoing the falsches at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was in resolution at the time (2001) just when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület had to eat there - the Mass Administrator thus stated that it was not to have the bills itself.
Knowledge Failed
The other group of accountants is persons who were quite aware that they had to put fictional accounts.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták, the Foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány has issued bills for the Foundation Együt a Harmadik Évezredért, at a height of about 4 million HUF.
According to the case-law, Collab Kft, the Executive Director of the Collab, was persuaded by one of the charged, Ludovic Györfi, to exhibit the fictional accounts.
The biogate Kft, which is currently also in liquidation, has also been cooperated with supplement and Co.: In 2003 the GmbH has provided the Foundation Jobb Jövért Alapítvány, as well as the Associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vorösfeny Waldo Egyesület with false accounts in the total value of HUF 5 million, which relate to unprecedented services.
However, there was also little payment traffic, as the accounts were cancelled immediately after their exhibition, but they have forgotten to note what they did in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall include persons directly in contact with the defendant.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postboat of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trade company that is located in Budapest, but not inventable there.
This company should have issued several accounts for the sale of EDV components at the total value of HUF in the period October to December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment kft from Kiskunhalas has been a buyer of these accounts since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to which Iván Kubatov should also send the company documents between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Cubatov has, during the investigations, issued bills on behalf of the GmbH. to the Associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have issued their countervalue itself.
The company Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos-Investment Bt. should have been founded by Romanian Maurers on Iván Kubatov's explicit desire.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, which was accused of lack of contracts.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: On request of his complicator, the lawyer Zsolt Scente, who had been commissioned to prepare the company's founding documents, he has issued accounts to the associations associated with supplements, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Overall, Cubatov has issued 15 accounts in the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations.
The prosecutor assumes that Cubatov could have cashed 10% of the total of accounts and VAT each.
Cubatov is even supposed to have abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional accounts - in this case the accounts have been accompanyed to the applications of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapittvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 Forint each, but these amounts have benefited from foreign purposes.
To exchange this, they presented five fictional accounts of the Works Team Kft.
These accounts were also guaranteed in the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the course of the negotiations, some accused persons now have a confession on the procedure of counterfeiting, as they have already been put before the state prosecutor.
A sensation could be if the main accused Jáno's supplement to a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised to report extensively on everything, his confession still fails.
So the question remains open whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him concerning the reimbursement of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether a supplement is prepared to take the responsibility.
But it is absolutely possible that a supplement now plays the "injured" after his quest for relief of imprisonment and house arrest had been struck on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused much greater damage to economic defects and have not reconciled them, stand on the free foot or at least under house arrest, the allowance remains rejected.
The psychology of excavation - or why we are willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, the buyers are inclined to spend more and therefore to overevaluate the foolbodies.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now managed to discover the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people in a competition, such as a sale on eBay, do not want to be slaughtered and are therefore willing to pay even excess prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the others participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of the volunteers were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the Striatum, a complex below the brain circus, was measured in the case of losers of the auction, in which the opponent’s survival plays a major role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore believed that the increase in prices could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the Striatum.
In order to support their these, the economists in the research group have conducted additional studies on the follow-up of the money.
In this case, three groups should offer to one partner under different conditions.
The control group was communicated to the true value of the product, afterwards they made their inputs.
Another group was also promised 15 dollar reward, in the case that they are winners from the game.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which had also been lost in the case of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore simply that the emphasis was on the one on profit, while the other was on loss.
As evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "to lose" group were prepared for higher efforts than those in the control or win group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have just just justified the practices observed in auctions with the joy of gaining or risk prevention.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved by the visual neurologic procedures, so that we now have a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Economic Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is your doctor inquired?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected persons is estimated to be a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because the patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for different virus-infectious liver diseases.
The symptoms are often similar - hepatic inflammation and yellow inflammation are common, but the causes and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the incidence, the hepatitis virus spreads to two different types: with hepatitis A and E through the digestive traction (for example by contaminated foods or water), hepatitis B, C and D can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, skele secret or spice).
Travellers are recommended to vaccine against the virus A and B at least, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two-tre weeks after consuming the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and breakthreat.
Thereafter the yellow liquor appears on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can take up to two-three weeks.
Around 1 million people worldwide die of hepatitis B caused, far more severe diseases such as liver cancer and hepatic cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only every tenth infected person is in medical treatment.
Hepatic C may also have serious consequences: untreated may lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most of the infected do not even know about their disease, as the inducer destroys the liver cells stupidly - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular checks, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more frequently: those who have had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoo.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients is estimated to be 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease is already proven in a routine laboratory study, it is advisable to visit the home doctor in the first signs of unknown origin.
At the right time, the disease is healable, the virus can be eradicated, thus banning the risk of infection and preventing the emergence of cancer.
The 30th September is the World Day of Hepatitis, 2004 for the first time held by patient representatives worldwide.
The objective of the action is to strengthen consciousness for this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their origin and the importance of early identification.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research results show that religious belief acts like a kind of "smart" that has already made the death of Catholic martyrs easier.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it has been examined in how much faith in God affects human pain feelings, the British magazine reported "Telegraph".
During the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electro shocks, while they studied a painting of the mother of God.
As the results showed, the believers could disable the majority of the pain.
With a brain scan technology, it was even possible to demonstrate that the Catholics could activate the part of their brain responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project, which, besides scientists, also shares philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university.
When attempted, a flashing device was connected to the left hand to the volunteers, which gave off the electric shocks.
The participants were asked to concentrate strongly on two paintings: one of the pictures of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and the other Leonardo da Vincis "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the virgin Mary among the believers would produce a kind of religious trance while they chose Vinci's image because it was hardly different from the other painting and felt as reassuring.
The experimenters spent a half hour each in a MRI scanner and received 20 electric shocks in four stages during this period, while they should either look at the religious, or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that when they looked at the mother of God, they would have felt "in security" as if they were "aware of" and they would have felt "calm and peace".
While considering the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than if they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the trial, thought that similar effects could also be caused with other, highly effective images also with the atheists, but they had to find the appropriate photo.
"We have to find a picture that causes very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"Practicing of faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases," said Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question remains which effect a Madonna image Leonardos or another similar painter would have on the pain control of the believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're telling about you
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can say with fug and right: it is found in the bags of the people as about her heads in heaven: she knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go and what they move.
And so still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managers.
In the direction of skeptics, who are plagued by Orwellschen horror visions, he lets it set out: these would just overlook the essential of the Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times Schmidt recently said that Google's main goal was to collect even more personal data about the users and thus get closer to the company's original goal to "organize all the information of this world".
Schmidt explained that after ten years of changing work, Google is still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked for the status of Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google would be able to answer questions like "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits with me?" but software programs are not yet able to know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms would be registered during their Internet investigations, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitors to save their own search history and later take back to the results so that the results can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is based on the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends customized products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the case of data abuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company, which acts terrifying, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the resentment of the power that rejects many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored but are also distributed to third parties in the event, and in these law cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A parade example for this was recently the action against pedofilia in Brazil, which, as Google provided information to the Brazilian government, was collected by the Community site called "Orkut" and also enabled the identification of the pedophiles.
However, for personal rights concerned users could still breathe in May when Google, together with the Civil Rights Organization EFF, successfully moved against the FBI before court: therefore, Google can also be forced in the future with no constitutional point to issue information to the FBI on a secret request.
(Allerdings, the Federal Government has successfully resulted in the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the youth protection law adopted years ago, but it has been refraining from the list of individual users, or their web and search terms list to two months.)
Google's image remains controversial: those who unfortunately release their personal data, because they fear the loss of their private and intimate privacy by using Google services, the company is beating with the embarrassment that the companies should represent themselves conservatively.
However, the American "Geek" culture, which is present in many countries and embraces enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of the "coolen entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leaders, even if both fight for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that Google does not request its users identification codes, unlike Microsoft, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program packing appear to be much more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software gigant.
On the other hand, the geeks look through the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet measuring - a relationship that has been focused especially in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is nothing but colaboration, speaking that users will deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the sizes are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show itself publicly.
At the same time, an average youth can manage his profile on several Community portals - from Facebook via Xanga, can connect it through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually mount it into a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can lead blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that have been exposed to Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: When viewing the party photos last night, the friend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the staff will be dismissed because in his blog he only makes his trouble about the management of the company - one is sure: the term "Private" has now been completely re-tolished.
Whoever leads an online life is what he commends himself - in such a way, you could form the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And whoever trys to keep something secret, or even deal with the Google Monopol, can do this - like Scroogle, a tool that, although touches the Google search engine, does not deliberately leave any traces.
Not many people are deliberately not registered on Community pages so that they can't be found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, the public opinion is waiting for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even before IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising areas of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly introduced services are not only Microsoft but also other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the alarming counterpoles: For example, the company leader has totally rejected a protest of employees after the fee of the company's own children's garden has been doubled, the management also felt that the multi-time care of employees was too expensive. However, all of this is fairly mild to say that Google was even in the knees before the Chinese government in 2006 and agreed with an agreement that all regimenic hits, or those who violate good taste, would be filtered out.
The internal regulation of the group is that no new service is admitted in advance, but only if it is already available. However, the events of the coming months and years could reconsider some strongly: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scan or archive project is now accepting the extent that the company has to deal with the Supreme Court soon, others are rather concerned about the "Health" system that allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already deliver the substance - for example "Scroogled", the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes in best orwellian manner a future in which a person, thanks to Google, becomes terrible.
Two youths help the double murderer of Ozd in the removal of tracks
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of helping to eliminate the traces, the speaker of the police commissioner Borsod informed on Tuesday.
The young people were duly accused of the aid at present.
According to information from the MTI news agency, it is two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with a freedom penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a 23-year-old ortsowner, was inspected on Sunday.
The man is under urgent misunderstanding that he has deliberately murdered several people.
In the course of the investigations, it has been found that the 23-year-old had debted a 53-year-old to a greater amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to compensate for his debts, so he attracted his creditor to a land in Ozd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of a long hand - this also demonstrates the fact that he committed the murders with a hidden weapon in the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police now examine the tattoo and the circumstances of their use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange offers for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw stock exchange offered for the hundred percent purchase of the share packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of Warsaw Börse, confirmed the offer that Poland had made despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as possible owners of their stocks.
That's why the Warsaw stock belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, but they want to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily newspaper "E15", Poland's offerings include the highest purchase price that has been offered for the Prague stock.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Transatlantic, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange is probably the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent participation, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the viewpoint of European newspapers
In its comments devoted to the continuing international financial crisis on Tuesday, some leading European leaves already spoke of "second 11 September".
The global financial disaster has been due to the American President, for example, to "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to have his own party for the draft of the law back to one who should bring some relief into the alarming situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billion-weight investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September".
Parts of the press in Madrid also placed the sinbow in Washington.
According to the "El Mundo" the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The American financial system is increasingly threatening to collapse, and below the world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in the Congress, it threatens the danger that Washington has no political means of crisis management.
The world economy depends in the air, just at a time when one of the largest transformations of capitalism is taking place.
You can no longer let the threat be overlooked, for example, the Geneva says "Tages-Anzeker".
Although some States could still provide savings packages to their bankrupts and save banks with taxpayers' money from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and there are no more banks, then no further financial injections or other emergency measures will help.
The EU Member States had to jump over their shadows on the long-term and centralize control over monetary markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to weakening monetary institutions, the Vienna Standard recalls. Furthermore, according to the newspaper, the concerns are ever more realistic that, after the Americans, the European taxpayers have to take a little deeper into their bags to get out of the crisis.
Until now, the EU has not been seriously dealing with the crisis, which is now fed like a tsunami across the old continents.
Although the "reliefers" do not have to "sweep" at once with several hundred billion euros, it would be advisable to maintain in what case it would be reasonable to address the taxpayers' money in order to reduce even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitate the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies to prevent accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example those of the bees.
The CEATEC in Japan was presented with an amazing project in which the Nissan engineers were inspired of humbling in the creation of new accidents avoiding systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetical system of type BR23C, a mini car equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In the flight each bee forms its own oval "Private Area", which is very similar to our own "Shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology-PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in every direction and in a angle of more than 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a face field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately initiates the collisions avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in second break parts, and the authoroboter immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this manoeuvre takes place purely instinctively.
"If not, the authorboter could not respond quickly enough to eliminate the obstacles," explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the authoroboter project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innerest and most vulnerable part of the protective shield - a layer that is currently considered inevitable within the accidents.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees when they deviate other bees.
And this has to run in the fraction of a second.
However, unlike the bees, the deviation cannot go up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, only towards the turnability of tyres.
While the bees are infinitely open here to deviate other bees, the researchers were able to use only the rotation movement, the acceleration and brake.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient and therefore have longer life than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent response, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device must process only some inputs per second and respond accordingly to them.
It does not have to save this, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of previous manoeuvres, so it is running just using a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte-wear memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collisions prevention technology, which, according to Nissan estimated, will be serial in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find technology in the GPS satellite navigation by consciously directing the driver about obstacles and thus leading it to the goal.
A name for the sinning child
Now the written version of the 700-Mard-Dollar heavy rescue package code is available, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at buying the bad loans of the banks.
In the first passage, half of the money is to be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local coast, the Congress Members, after multi-day debates on an agreement on the 700-million dollars of rescue package, reported Reuters.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the democratic president of the American House, and said that the agreement had to be brought to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both Presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance, Henry Paulson, said to the result: The programme will show effect and it will be effective, but you have to do even more. According to Pelosi, it was not about saving the Wall Street, but about raising the Ruler of the Economy.
The written version of the package was still published before opening the Asian markets, i.e., Washington's time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Mediterranean time Monday 2 a.m.), but did not trigger a high flight on the stocks.
On Monday, the House first agrees on the draft legislation on the stabilisation of the economy from 2008, the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress achieved in the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilise our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
However, the programme deviates from the original recommendation of Bush administration that the 700 billion dollars should be spent at once for the purchase of fooler, with credit charged securities.
In a first tranche, a maximum of the half of the 700 billion amount will be spent, with 250 billion instantly available after the convention is expected to be voted on the Causa on Monday. This sum is intended to be used for the purchase of credit valves, bad securities, and the president will decide over the additional 100 billion USD.
The programme will be reviewed by an own Commission, which also belongs to the president of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the convention.
In the meaning of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and securities charged with mortgage, or other "toxic" loans.
As reported by competent members of the Ministry, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law enables the undertakings concerned to participate in a insurance programme where the Ministry of Finance guarantees the anxious resources and to pay the costs expected to be charged.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means so that up to 700 billion dollars can be made available as an emergency aid to the American financial system, whether it is for the large purchase of poor funds, their insurance, or the avoiding of a system risk caused by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We set the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it was signed, so Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and are now in charge of State aid can expect that their manufactures, called "Golden Handshake", are reduced by the government in the overseas snake.
A reduction in salaries will only occur in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that when the Ministry purchases in the framework of an auction, the Golden Handshake is taxed, unless the transferred bank manager is disposed of to the pension.
In the case of a direct purchase of the bold loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the manager payers are not excessive.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake Treaties are not changed - the restrictions are only related to new agreements so that more people can participate in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that reductions in manager salaries are regulated by law, commented by Democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, the measure.
The State gains participation rights in the participating banks so that the risk for taxpayers is reduced, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank goes better.
The draft legislation provides that the President must submit a proposal to the Congress over the next five years to the taxpayers to return their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect the money of taxpayers, so Californian republikan Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Captain, said: The measures were driven by the same people, who are also responsible for the collapse of the Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Like the Central Statistical Office, the domestic sales prices increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared to August 2007, about 12.9 per cent.
The export prices were 1.1 per cent higher than those in July 2008 and have decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to the prices of the previous year.
As a result of price change in the domestic and export sector, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2% higher than in 2007.
The domestic sales prices have just risen slightly compared to the previous month, i.e. by 0.1 per cent.
The sales prices of the processing industry also increased only - 0.1 per cent - since July.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was in leather products (2.8 per cent) - primarily in bags and belts - with 4.6 per cent, in shoes prices increased by 2.5 per cent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials significantly increased prices for chemicals and production (1.6 percent).
A price reduction was recorded in raw oil processing (1.4 per cent), in electrical and technical equipment (0.9 per cent), as well as in wood processing (0.1 per cent).
The prices in the paper production, as well as in the publishing and printing plant, remained unchanged.
In other branches of the processing industry, a price increase was measured between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the important domestic markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, primarily due to the increase in gas prices introduced on July 1.
If the domestic sales markets of the processing industry are considered in the annual comparison, prices in raw oil processing have risen the strongest (32.4%).
In the metal-processing sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in food, beverages and tobacco were 11 percent.
A price reduction was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and in electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The extent of incineration in the other processing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Total prices in the processing industry climbed by 10.2 per cent last year.
The prices for electricity, gas, steam and water increased by 18.7 percent compared to the previous year.
In August, the highest price increase was recorded on the domestic sales market in the investment goods sector (0.7 percent).
In the production sectors for consumer goods prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while they remained equal in the energy and further processing sector compared to the previous month.
The largest price increase in August 2008 was observed in the energy and further consumption sector compared to the 2007 comparison period (16.8 per cent).
Sectors manufactured in consumer goods were a price increase of 6.8 per cent, where investment goods recorded a price reduction of 1.4 per cent.
The export prices measured in Forint increased by 1.1 per cent in August, however, by 3.9 per cent in the year.
The domestic currency became 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, $7.1 per cent weaker, and compared to the August 2007 course, it increased by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro, even with $15.9 per cent.
No more visa in the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-ungarian visa agreement to enter into force by the 12th of the Jews, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs explained to the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
Their view is that "all is now dependent on whether the electronic immigration or control system will be introduced in the overseas time."
It also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists would have to register in advance.
The Head of Hungarian Diplomation leads negotiations in Washington from now on.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will transmit the "Medlere Service Cross with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she will also talk with the foreign policy advisors of the Democratic Barack Obama and the Republican Presidential Candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support saving packages for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the great American parties, agreed their support for the 700 billion dollars of savings package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After days of Marathon consultations on Sunday morning, the Congress and the Government's representatives announced that they had reached an agreement on the banking relief package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the upturn of the frozen credit market, became the key issues of the Presidency campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country from the economic crisis.
After recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand its lead thanks to the economic topics, while McCain's high, which gave him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention.
On a election event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the convention will quickly accept the law of the 700 billion dollars heavy package.
He emphasized that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported with.
"We must act now, responsible (...) - your jobs, your savings, all industry, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened," he said before 35,000 spectators.
He didn't forget to call McCain's economic views "obsolet".
In an interview given to the sender ABC, McCain explained: "We'll all have difficulty (...) but nothing is certainly an alternative."
The Republican senator said that the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control committee for the Minister of Finance, as well as the limitation of the finishes for top managers - something he has made.
The CBS told Obama that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, while, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday the speaker of the representative house, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the House of Members will probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press view of the German-speaking room
The right camp is intact, only the voters were more self-conscious in the camp - so commented "The Mirror" the weak performance of the CSU in Bayern.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (piece.de)
In the online release of the left-hand German news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayerns Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned policeologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his offices.
The Christian socials have renewed Bayern over decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The breakthrough of the era is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the decay of the CSU didn't come, but on Sunday something ended, but that was quite precisely ten years ago: the unambiguous hegemony of a state party
For ten years ago, 1998, the CSU lands at 47.7 per cent and has fallen under the Fifty Percent Brand for the first time since the fifty years.
This was repeated three years ago at the Federal Day elections in 2005, i.e. in the much quoted Stoiber era.
Modernisation, which is consistently operated by the CSU in the country, has finally destroyed their own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but in the pace, it was significantly deteriorating. However, the secularisation, the result of education, the influencing of East and North Germans into the prospering regions of Bayern on the faithfulness of CSU choices could not remain without effect.
Modernisation always goes along with optional increases, and that has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and voluntary.
It is noticeable that in the last few weeks the classic civil groups expressed the largest distance to the CSU: the free professions, commercial citizenship and voters with abitural such as graduation.
Here the support of the CSU decreased to even less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Wiener Tageszeitung reports in its "Who with? Heads of Parties in Coalition Questions" articles about the chaotic internal policy situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal matters.
The BZÖ appears open in all directions for conversations, while the Greens do not want to decide on a coalition yet.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders were hardly watching their cards.
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation of both parties is very well possible - in some federal countries and in the social partnership is this already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current OVP chief as a vice-chairman, was open to Faymann.
As he said, the voters would have chosen the Schüssel-Molter-Kurs.
A repetition of this direction was not in question.
However, molter has responded cautiously to red offers.
Cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann attempts to interfere with the ÖVP's internal concerns.
Whether his party is in opposition, or in the coalition, is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed in the interior of the OVP.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent red black, we are willing to assume government responsibility," said Haider.
Jaróka: The Devil’s circle of poverty and segregation must be broken through
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, which is aimed hardly by the EU Presidency country of France.
In its speech addressed to the plenary, Livia Járóka, Fidesz Members of the European People's Party, in particular to the educational exclusion, since this is one of the most serious legal infringements that Roma children experience, and this is also the biggest obstacle to their need for application.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and civil organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As reported by the press office of the MEPs of Fidesz, Járóka noted that, in addition to discrimination in job searching, Roma would primarily be forced from the labour market because of its low level of education.
"The majority of the Roma Youths have no educational education, and due to poor basic education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree".
In addition, Járóka stressed that education was a fundamental human rights which was a key role in the adoption of other human rights.
Investments in early education of Roma children can strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
According to the Members, it is important that this context becomes aware of a broadest possible circle - i.e. Roma and non-Roma.
For once a Roma student starts school, then its chances to become a productive member of the labour market are increasing and, through income and salary taxes, they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, the Roma must be guaranteed the right to high quality education - the bad and segregated education needs to be settled," says Livia Járóka.
As the honourable Member stated, a common, objective and action-oriented approach of the European Union is necessary in order to speed up the disregulation process in the educational sector, which requires proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break through the devil circle from poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóka demanded.
Since the Berlin Conference last year, the summit has been organised annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the pre-existing of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equality of Chances".
CSU: Gladness on time
At the end of October, the destiny of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the election debuction, sometimes no heads are rolling, at the top of the Bavarian CSU the staff debates were held.
Party chief Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace lasts.
About the fate of the Tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of vote will be decided on the extraordinary party day on the last October week.
The much trained Duo, however, already made it look through that it doesn't want to stick to her seats.
They want to remedy the indignant group and the party base that demanded personal consequences one day after the "Bayerian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber on his career peak, the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. But now, one year after the putch against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of the votes could be secured.
The CSU was "all-in-regier" in Bayern for 46 years, which generates 18 percent of German GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern state that is important for the Hungarian economy, it will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of party interior restructuring, the potential successor Hubers, Vice-President and Bundesagrarminister Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the research team, which leads through a possible coalition with the liberal FDP, or the legally judged "free voters" talks about a possible coalition of coalition.
An irony of the fate is equal to that with the list "Free choosers" that Gabriele Pauli enters the legislature whose anti-stober appearances have first exploited the Huber-Beckstein Duo to serve the targeted politician graciously.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all its powers on the stabilisation of Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far drawn the lines from the background, will play an active role. On 28 September the former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called "the bitterest day of his political course".
On Monday Huber made a few toxic comments towards CDU - he believed that the CSU had deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which has contributed much to success at national level in 2005, has not been put on its legs again with a common act of force, Merkel cannot become a Chancellor after the Federal Day elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has not made a heal from her disappointment over the fiasko, believes that the CSU's terrain loss will not have a negative effect on the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relative: the injured CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of social Democrats will continue.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no Member of the Opposition has succeeded in the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this lies in prosperity and stability in the country guided by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects legal violations in the interpretation of the votes.
The OECD, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
De Legislatur of the 10-million resident state, although there have been no opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the counterparty, who was gathered under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), has sincerely hoped that Lukchenko, who, in the unclean elections and by a constitutional change in 2006, had already renewed his Presidency mandate for the fourth time, would allow some members of the opposition in Parliament this time.
That is why the ODS has even taken away from the previously planned Boykottes.
Ukraine is increasingly dependent on the rising prices for the import of natural gas from Russia. In view of the expectations of opposition, it has even received loans, and the country has also agreed to the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country, to the Russians. Thus, in the light of the expectations of the opposition, the hope that Ukraine would want to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukechenko and other high-level politicians have been banned by the EU's anti-democratic policy system.
The evaluation report of OECD elections, which stressed the positive movements rather than the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections - provided for a temporary relaxation.
However, the OECD's rapid report already criticized the campaign on Monday - therefore oppositionists would not be present in the press - and in particular the fact that opposition was not allowed to be present in the speaking of votes.
Nevertheless, the opposition can see a improvement in the political system: Political prisoners have, for example, been set freely, and Minsk is even prepared for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to recognize the independence of the abstinent Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abchasien, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on the paper, which has been regarded as independence for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our magazine.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to continue, although "the mighty have been afraid to leave only one opposition in Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in the light of the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have to fight with many problems here - the opposition newspapers need to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of sales stones, but yet I see that more and more people support the change, even the elderly," said Milinkewitsch, in suggesting that not even the most supported layer of the pensionists agrees with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only earnings are the production of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the increase in trade deficit, it is just a matter of time until the "social security" that is in the silence of a cemetery begins to break," says Milinkewitsch.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democraticly.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Community Mission of Independent States, explained to the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the acts and not the words." The lack of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now it is frozen before work"
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are turnable doors for the entrance and exits of the officials.
From now on, the measure will enter into force against those Slummeier who only stamp and then drink coffee during the working time.
The new "Anti-Faulpelz Act" was present today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
">"Drawable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services," says Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," stresses Brunetta again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of turnable doors is also of great symbolic value."
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by everyone who came from all sides of cooperation."
All in everything, so there's no breakfast anymore during working time; finish with coffee or Croissant .
Brunettas advises in this regard with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works miraculous".
During a meeting of the Upper Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
of Rome, the Minister announces that "in three months the absence of officials has been reduced to 50 %, i.e. 60,000 people are more present at work each year".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the effectiveness of the Italian public administration.
"their wage dynamics - according to the Minister - have been twice as high in the last 8-10 years as the private sector and far above the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have joined together to counter the Brunetta Decree in the context of Codacons' appeal.
"When the Minister of Public Services is profiling with figures about lower absences at work - the Consumer Centre writes - the people of the 'active fauls' are growing uninterrupted.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have been gathered together to explain the counterfeit standards of the decisive war."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related diseases; the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick employee, during which control visits can be made, and fighting further aspects of the Minister's renewal.
Napolitano: "Prevention against work accidents is crucial"
Every day in Italy, 2500 work accidents occur, three people die and 27 remain lifelongly invalid.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal work accidents were about 1200.
These figures demonstrate the seriousness of a phenomenon, which causes almost twice as many deaths as caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will be the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents in all Italy's provinces, so that the attention of social institutions and media will be directed to this dramatic situation.
"The alarming, spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the decisive importance of the issue of prevention at work.", the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione national mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its "great appreciation for the constant commitment to preventing jobs, protecting injured workers, supporting the families of the victims and for awareness of public opinion".
"An emphasized "Basta" has raised itself to this, understandably in tragedys that, measured in its size, cause some wrinkles in the media and public participation. However, everyday reality often faces us with dramatic events that can even repeat in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that " there is in any case also a resource problem: it needs to be invested decisively in education and information."
The many initiatives are particularly important for a more direct consciousness in school frameworks for young people who are feeding the labour world.
It is our duty to focus on this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness. You have to put into force and improve a legislative norm.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber of Gianfranco Fini stressed "which the phenomenon of work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency, which insists on the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules aimed at putting an end to the problem".
"The data of work accidents seem to signal a light improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is too high," emphasizes President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy at the end."
"How do you think that you're doing too little in order to meet the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight through various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – so Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to inform workers who are already starting in school."
"An additional effort is necessary - so he adds - with regard to communication and awareness of public opinion.
But above all, a greater responsibility of the employers is demanded for a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli also called for "the progressive worsening of the protection of the accident victims of the work" and called for the "determination of the social system against which we are fighting in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to give the employer a guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the victim of an accident will not be dependent on voluntary or random donations decided by a lawgiver from time to time."
Mp3 player under charge: risk of hearing damage
According to music over a longer period with portable musical devices, such as Mp3-Player, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is the report by the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (the Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU in a report published today in Brussels.
"The report – as it says in a note – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who have heard the lasting loss of their hearing for at least five years per week longer than one hour a day’s sound music with portable musical devices.
"I am worried that such a large number of youths who usually put portable musical devices and mobile phones on a high volume, will indispensably harm their hearing without knowing it," said Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – as it says from the EU – show a clear risk that implies rapid action.
What is really important is to make consumers sensible and to make this information common.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the existing control systems again, so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical equipment among young people.
"The scientists - this is the conclusion of the EU Communication - confirm that you are too concerned and that the European Commission will now examine the necessary measures to protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable musical equipment and similar equipment."
There is already a European standard at the moment that limits the level of noise of portable musical equipment to 100 dB. The concern about the damages that could arise from a too large noise load.
These damage can be very limited, in which you can handle solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise suspension.
In their report, the scientific committee of the EU pointed out that if users of portable musical devices hear noise only five hours a week (since 89 decibels) so that the legal limits already exceeded the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who exceed this limit risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This means, therefore, 5-10% of users of such devices whose number can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno gives the start of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We start today, it's supposed to be over in March, in June the balance will be drawn.
This is the course set by Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". The Commission has met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla Thermen.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 Members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project will be completed, the City and City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome in June with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the supreme mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," stresses Alemanno. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome whose political responsibility remains the city and municipal council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where a large project can be developed for Rome.
In March, its task will be completed and the Commission will resolve itself, as such a project must have a timely final point.
In June - so announces the Citizen - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence are lacking their views of liability, Alemanno replies: "All depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, policy is dealing with the daily problems and emergency cases that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period in view to work seriously in a deeper perspective on the development of Rome and the future of the city."
The Citizen of Rome puts great importance in clarifying the following: "This Commission is neither a useful institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free of charge, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent, and it will bring us to reflect. It will work on the best heads of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static to allow our city to have a quality jump - which it really needs - and thus to take a common step in the future".
A future, so the supreme mayor of Rome, which "will limit it not only in the current communal borders but will look much further," not only as regards the role of Rome as the Metropole and the political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American President?
A well-known American politician, who has a lot to be regarded as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, through his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations with the established Islam (and this is still doing as a private man today).
The attacks against Obama become increasingly vigorous, just now where the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very frightened: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!".
In fact, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks, and they do not answer the voters' question: will he be a good President? And then there are also the surveys; all say that Obama will win with a great advance.
In this case, there are people who talk to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: only in the election cabin we will probably know who the real American patriot will give his voice.
Here comes a mentality of the United States, which was last hidden.
"If you say what you want, we'll decide who we'll make our crochet for, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something that you never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What error did Bush make during his term of office? 89% answered: the war in Iraq.
America changes.
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a trip in the backs.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of the weakness of Bush.
The person who will take his position is facing a huge task.
United States. The financial collapse also leaves its traces to journalists: In the newspapers you can already feel the reductions. And many accuses the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were consulted by the PEW Research Center on their situation and their mental control on the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really explain the information concerning the competent because of the general credibility.
They don't feel as lonely as they were before.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems come through the reductions in the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the great audience understands it, not significantly shrinking.
A clear but complex pessimism is now fulfilling the American journalist.
Six of ten journalists and Executive Seniors of the press are of the opinion that journalistism is on the wrong way at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine in what direction the web goes.
The main publishers are the way to the Internet, which is considered by many as the "Killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure", which journalists feel, has risen by 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to want to join the new technology, in the hope "it brings something good for journalistism".
The biggest rice is in American journalism today between the heads of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the headmasters at national level are certain that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level only 23%.
Some think it has to do with the "security in the work".
The operators who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
The journalists are 30%.
The theme of the "safe work" in the team (our "reporters", then Red) is always a current topic in the United States.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation, as it are the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and Internet operators, employers as they are popular and so it will be a question of take it or leave it.
Chefredacters receive very often very high wages, but the editor may sometimes receive only 10,000 euros per month, including pension and insurance.
As for vacation, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they admit themselves, will often be "sick" over the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JUDGMENT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLIBED IN GROTTAFERRATA
The President of the second court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate maker, which had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola for bankrot in the context of the investigation on the counter agreement in the event of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was converted to a residence obligation to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate maker to be moved from the province city to a home in the capital.
According to the Court of Justice, such relocations (to which the prosecutor had spoken) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain prosecutive evidence to him.
The Elite is in danger
The phenomenon had been revealed a few days ago when the House of Members voted against the 700 billion dollars package of the White House: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing the Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the last edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis in the course of the Republican Party is in a wider way, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast Seas, which always promoted the government institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are hostile to "the ones in Washington" and the financial world and, for example, wins voters in the south and the centre of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise to the voice of which I mentioned above.
However, this just mentioned example is only a small part of the major changes that announce the current economic earthquake or even represent: not only in the United States, even in the West, and perhaps beyond these will be affected.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the longly feared events, which, under these new conditions, finally accept and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unreasonable renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalisation of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decay of banking and financial institutions having close links with abroad and also manages an excessive amount of assets of private households living in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments, namely how to deal with the affected families, which also represent a huge voter mass.
So the crisis appears economically global, politically, it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to be in a disadvantage and have lost its right to speak: the clear evidence of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its twins in various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of its own state; rescue plans, new rules, and, for example, the distribution of aid funds: since the crisis has become more serious, only the United States in the economic situation are to be saved without foreign aid.
Besides the resources, they also have the legitimacy to use these: therefore, two non-recoverable conditions – under certain circumstances – which otherwise no international organisation and no market will be able to take into account in a similar way.
This new emphasis, which is placed on the state-national element, is perfectly in line with the increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with a most closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is just now, when we were so convinced that we had already entered a networked total empire, in an empire of ever-differented technologies, intellectuals, that we have to find out at once how our future will be increasingly dependent on essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although all of these can be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are extremely connected with a closely-defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in an inherited, waterless or free area of oil.
I will now come to the second news, but it will require a short inclusion.
Whosoever territorium, who government, who says politics, also says Leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the knowledge of the need for respected leaderships is, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to handle things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of dissolution about the existing guides, for example those of the economy, which have come out as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
In addition, there is a deeper and in some sense still worrying aspect: a loss of trust, an immortality, an image of inappropriateness, a feeling of distances, which all focuses on a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems so that the conviction among large parts of the population seems to be the way that it is not only the deeds of social elite, but already their ideas world, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority of which is ever stranger and more convenient.
Thus, the demand for Leadership is underground for a tightened but powerful movement of the removal of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the unconditional conversion of the collective state of the last time: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, towards the rebellion of the American Members against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the rights in Italy also plays a role here).
One wins the impression that the old elite, its parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual believers, some would say their format, increasingly understanding problems and therefore less representative value in terms of what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and is still increased by the financial crisis and is driven to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would simply be excessive to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes far open is certainly not.
The super plug that lets the walls go up
The forces of gravity to conquer thanks to a climbing material and to climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached almost the target.
The researchers have managed to fix a 100 kg grave body on a vertical wall with a surface of only 2.5 qcm.
The STUDIO – a U.S. magazine has published the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanor tubes.
"The principle of climb can be imagined as a series of spaghetti-organized tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the Geckos, which are covered by microscopic herbs that give the animal a perfect stop.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass Teflon and sleeve paper have shown that the new cable is ten times greater than the durability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "removing without problem from the wall", says Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering Sciences at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a predominant sticker," adds Liming Dai.
Something like Spiderman walking on walls? Maybe, but the researchers think more of a less fascinating advantage, such as the connection of electrical equipment, because the nanor tubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application may fall within space.
So for the moment, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF FORSCHING – also the University of Berkeley, California, dedicated to a new climb type.
In an article of the American Chemical Society, California scientists present a climb of microfibres that clean themselves up as hair by movement on an surface itself from dust and thus keep perfect liability.
Medicinal products: Never take with fruit juice
Take care of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These beverages, which are consumed due to their refreshing quality and their vitamin richness, for example in summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken at the same time with certain vital medicines, since they can affect their intake by the body extremely.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packed and fresh fruit juices associated with medicines. During the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he reapplied alarms: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the captureability of certain vital medicines so that they are practically eliminated and the health of patients is threatened.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthetmics, cardiocyclic drugs, anxiolytic and neurologic drugs, up to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS IN FAHR – The same agency of the medicine had in a report two years ago warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix and stressed to take care of what is drunk in connection with medicines such as diazepan or methadone.
ES IS NOT NEVER GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice include substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, Michele Carruba, director of the University of Statale di Milano, calls: "Such results are usually transmitted immediately to the various international manufacturers, which are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is recommended that you always read the package leaflet and, if there are inconsistencies, do not ask a pharmacist or a doctor,” stresses the expert of the Ansa agency.
Economic Nobel Price goes to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel price is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the largest critics of the economic and external policy of Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman claimed in a guide article of the New York Times that this second event was more decisive for the history of the United States than the attacks.
A prediction that did not receive little polemics as a response and was kept to the economist many years later, but today proved to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked about how quickly the memory of the scandals has disappeared in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom from the public perspective," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economic of great value", but also a Banaliser with a "very aggressive style, especially against the excessive liberalism of the Bush Government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has arrived; the Open Source Software wins an increasing number of users, both at home and at the office, both among free and public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which are monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some news to the audience: next to a revised and now spartanely designed start menu, it has finally reached a guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against was also considered the compatibility with Microsofts Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interestingly, some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, e.g. facilitate sending via email. This also includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphic editing modules and maintaining the original appearance of the page.
So you can now also generate "hybride" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: tables can now be handled by several users, avoiding conflicts in changes; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a fraction to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are about to publish various functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is to be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can send the installation CD home or to the office.
However, if free of charge is an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is also in the business area where OpenOffice could succeed in the big yard: at last, various public administration and schools have already been transferred to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text generation program; Calc, the table program aimed at pushing Excel; Impress, for the creation of presentations like with Powerpoint; Dbase for running databases instead of the more known access; and last draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily exceed 3 million and 600 thousands already now.
Coal also tested positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens a new doping case mi frame of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and winner of the best climbing tricot.
The message published the daily L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old coal of the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver, who was tested positively on Cera, the Epo of the third generation. It had already met with the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of coal belong to those performed in the last weeks by the laboratorys Losanna and Chatenay malabry.
If the countertests now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest and also announced the Austrian competitors according to the Associated Press.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans to the podium and also claimed the Trikot of the best climbing for himself.
THEMA INDUSTRY: THE NEW YORK TIMES FREE: IS ITALIEN RASSISTIS?
Italy, "the single country of the immigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only reversed.
Does this from Belpaese a nation of racists? This asks the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the subject of racism in Italy and the case of the young, stomach Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he had stolen a package of cakes.
The case shows what the Times calls "Paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and working opportunities" exist, yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the largest support of Lega Nord".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times calls for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by Lega against immigration and to the faster exhibit of illegal immigrants is also mentioned as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement, which also emphasizes the Pope and the President of the State: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between Church and State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900 euro per room high rental prices
The market for housing for students does not know any crises.
According to the last study by the Sunia union, a single room can cost up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already adopted very serious moves. Many students lose their right to study so in fact, as their families are not able to support them in this height" – Laura Mariani responsible – "in these cities the great demand of students leads to a deformation of the market, which has damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most of the rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, without leasing price limits, unauthorised sub-hire.
For the Sunia, the need for exceptional measures resulting in lower rent prices by rehabilitation of taxation.
In a closer examination of the study, it is found that in Milan a sleeping space is required at the Brianza quarter of about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 Euros (in the quarter of Bande Nere) and ends with 800 Euros in the Lambiate quarter, Udine and Fiera or even 900 Euros in the Vittoria quarter.
In Florence, an average sleeping space costs 350/400 euros, one room 700.
In Bologna, where students focus in the quarters around the university, 250/280 euros are for a sleeping space of nuts, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the quarters around the Uni are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a double room sleeping space.
The rents in the quarters around the other universities of Rome are only a little deeper: 550 euros in East Asia and Cinecittà.
Only those in outside districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping space and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping space, for a room, the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping space costs 250-350 euros, one single room is at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of hire to non-European students is more frequent, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% higher than the average is required by foreign students.
Welcome to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historical cinema
The historical cinemas are closed due to the beneficiary multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinema is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This image of the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the large city centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multisale complexes in the periphery, means in the long term the death of the Einaalkino in the centre. A process that does not only appear inevitable and irrevocable but also wears the trains of a cultural crime.
In most cases, historical places are filled with memories, "it is like a friend to lose a piece of street with emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him into the Oskar and the great price of Cannes 20 years ago. It is the story of a foretown kino and its nostalgy, which consists of living in a well lost cinema world.
The numbers that the Anec, the central trade association, deliver, speak a clear language: in the last five years the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas had to be closed; these cinemas paid mostly the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions include the Emilia romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by the Tuscany with 44 and the Lombardei with 41.
This shows that the main guilts are the multiplexkinos, because they are just these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas were registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the Lombardei leads the lists, 81 are both in the Tuscany and the Emilia romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but first of all, the retention of the already existing, because a room in the city is closed, not all its family customers are ready to visit a multiplex cino in the periphery instead of the old.
And here is the lack of etat for the fund of the trade association: the debt burden of the State is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame of ethical-moral view that the government does not respect existing laws.
In order to obtain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year of necessities would be.
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, who, due to the fears of the old cinema, decided to protect it through an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy, aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinema, both in the historical centre and in the periphery.
The predicted measures also include tax benefits for the cinema operators as well as benefits for the public in relation to transport: it will be allowed to drive into the transport-limited areas of the centre and also to park for more favourable parking fees.
"It is a happy initiative," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
But surely we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to direct something against the superpower of the multiplex sales, because the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important theme for me: the closure of the "supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that brought me to the foundation of the "Nuovo cinema paradiso" even if I had played with the thought for 10 years.
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; when I pass through the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side in order not to have to see the dust-coated posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta' lead to arrest of the Mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli Group of Mafia.
The accusations of the Antimafia Officers of Kalabrien against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his Vice-President Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for the involvement in mafia shops, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly intermediate between the Clan and the public administration, and its nephew was also taken into hands: the lawyer, who wears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a compensation sum of 10 million euros because of the involvement in criminal associations of the Mafia.
"Every kind of moral and legal standard disrespecting," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities."
"The Mafia Group was thus made possible – according to the judges – to insist officially in the Councils and to co-determine the public administration policy."
The Chairman of the Calabria Regional Committee Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "all other than an exception to interconnections between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who receive a white West'.
The arrests of this morning follow those of July, which, according to the Clan Piromalli police, were fired.
Since the end of April, the municipal council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, but the local politicians of their communities have already been dismissed in 1991 – and at that time because of the so-called links between organised crime and local administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected after the election of May 2006 to the head of the Middle Law coalition.
He screamed Skandal as the prefectur ordered the resolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in the Vice-President Marco Minniti, who he requested to have found everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges explained in connection with this morning's arrest order that the Piromalli-Clan had even dared to request a change in the A3 project.
From a hearing action related to the investigations on Dal Torrione case, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur, which is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making public administration measures identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy springs out of the waves, the greats suddenly run up
It is a non-sealing source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and this seems to be understood by the large energy companies in the world.
Wells, flows and tides are the new renewable energy sources on which all now look, and also to occupy, such as gigants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the sea's movements has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies have not accidentally intensified significantly since the first oil crisis.
When the oil price broke in by 1980, the idea of sea energy was poured in, but now the environmental organisations and the rising oil price are pressing on new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of global energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to the double of the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the flows and tides were still coming.
Giganten in attack.
The first company, which is now putting on sea energy, is Enersis, who signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in the north of Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry who are focusing on marine energy generation.
"Chevron examines these technologies" – the speaker of a company known to the U.S. Giganten in the Wall Street Journal – and considers the possibility of working with us."
This concerns the acquisition of an authorisation from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project on the coast of Alaska.
This is a not underestimating sign, e.g. when we consider that oil is continued to be promoted by the United States just in Alaska and President Bush has recently launched the plans for new drills.
Besides Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; are also the details not known, observers are speaking of an increasing interest.
Still improved technologies.
Experts are speaking of a technology still in the outbreak, not least because the last doubts have not yet been clarified by the environmental protection sides.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland have rather smaller dimensions and do not seem to cause serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy in a large scale, technologies with a much greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are different ways: Ocean Power uses for example a system of connected bows.
The shoe of the waves, which moves the bows up and down, will be converted into hydraulic pressure within the swimmer over colons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine that operates a generator again.
The electricity is sent to the coast through subwater lines.
So far, there are four planned plants of this kind, which are only waiting for the state approval. A part of the energy gained could also serve for military institutions.
However, Verdant Power already produces energy for a warehouse and a parking lot with the help of undersea turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during seasons drive the turbines, which eat the generator through the current rotation movement.
According to Verdant, a long snake from possible clients is waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the times.
According to the Institute for Electrical Production Research, a particular interest is now deserving the potential that is in time.
Although it is an irregular phenomenon, the times are better predictable than wind flows, sunlight and the waves, and therefore a more reliable source of electricity.
Especially the contemporary energy is what states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states have made to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
