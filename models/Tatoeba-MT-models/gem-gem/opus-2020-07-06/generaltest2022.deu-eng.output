I'm #PRS_ORG# Great Science and so it's no problem for me.
If you just need a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so that it can be taken as a retour by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# for 249€ a few days ago.
Today she costs 179€.
I really think that is very angry.
Do I have to cancel the order and order a new order for the better price or are there another way of crediting?
I also think that children should not be tempted to take a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones.
Let's look a little, help a little bit, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can be enough child, I can't see any problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for the short time and it's okay for him, it's good.
You can best measure yourself if that suits your children.
It's not true that he's supposed to fold K2 and join K2 for hours in sleeping.
Just legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps the statement of psychologists also comes.
Because if something actually should happen like a fire, inbreak, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to care for K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to enter, is of course your discretion;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a Krimi / Thriller a few years ago and I can remember almost all the action, but I don't want the title partout to fall into me anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and to treat it.
At the beginning of history, a veterinarian commits suicide by shaking himself with feed and walking to his robbery cats.
The case is taken by a Commissioner who, after a short investigation of his therapists, is the one who operates a hospital where he is afraid to treat patients.
The Commissioner has a little necessity who also fears (for fire) and lands with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously ordered to go to the place of the Self murder and document and put the photos on the Internet before each suicide.
In any case, it is discovered that this therapist operates a type of underground treatment group where the patients are planted a chip that is suppressed in the brain a fear center and the patients finally put their fear in the extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another goes to death intentionally)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the cruel act I am pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author / author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can betray the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh, yes, I don't have the Wlan password available.
You have to contact my husband.
But that can take a while.
What steps do I have to do afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference rejected ?

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to drive up-to-date vaccine
Always new Omikron Falls bring politics and science in the UK.
So until the new year, all qualified adults in England should receive an offer of vaccination.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to progress even faster in the Corona refreshment vaccines in view of rapid increases in Omicron payments than has so far been sought.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that the second vaccination has lasted at least three months, Johnson said to his countrymen in a video message recorded in advance on Sunday evening.
The target date was at the end of January.
The British Government will provide additional support in order to speed up vaccination campaigns in the country parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omicron variant, one faces an emergency, which is why the protection of the vaccine must be intensified, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's be mad!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron Falls were registered in Britain, thus increasing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent.
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price for collection?
I am for everyone to imagine with pronomes
I sent off a application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation via mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him, and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can anyone help me?
** I am a foreigner and I don't want any official to walk over my feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should imagine with pronome.
A total of 5 books on it.
Four of them.
Only one that I bought today won't go
Apparently, the chair had an unexplained lack of sale.
How can such a polster damage occur after 9 months?
Only try on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working since about.
14 days no longer.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and I wanted 8 to buy.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to add 2 chairs to order and take account of this.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I will write something details about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) come more often in contact with the victims (and the offenders) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really stirs at me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims don't get helped or we don't think we could help them.
I realize that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the offender far from sight and hearing, I can't reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's afraid to leave fear of revenge, fear of leaving the habitual social environment, fear of pulling the children out of this.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, partly myself is very close to tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help anyway... I know I can't.
But it will never make it easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series mean to "League of Legends"?

Basketball League: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least at Youngster Johannes Patrick was left.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's trainer John Patrick had said at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim, "We have something more angry in the abdomen."
But it did not lie after the game - but again increased in view of 61:72 (28:38) - downtown in the Basketball League.
More than the naked result disappointed the way of the appearance.
The threeer quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all of the young John Patrick) for saying and write 31 trials - more questions?
The answer was John Patrick: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife and did not implement what we had trained."
To move the ball.
Otherwise, his counter Sebastian Gleim responded: "To win a pleasant game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people before."
On Saturday, only 750 visitors were allowed in Hohenlohe-Arena, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best player I've ever trained," commended Gleim.
While Patrick's team itself failed the performance carriers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debakel, and came up to eight points after they had already laid 39:59.
Justin Simon came on twelve points next to John Patrick.
Fortunately, much time to hate is not left.
Already on Wednesday (19 a.m.) the Riesen receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg, a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had another email address before, but I changed it.
Yeah, I've been reporting a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all guarantee claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed again and have written them again.
We've originally been reporting a half year ago.
Stake as pellets out of the egg: Max Raabe will be 59
He can enthusiasm his audience with new interpretations of strokes from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the way with the "Good Day, dear luck" program - if he may occur.
In fact, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig.
But there's nothing from it.
The planned concert has been posted in May 2022 - "in order to control the Corona virus".
Other of his events planned during the advent period must also be taken out once, as it says on the website of the singer, who becomes 59 today, and its musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January the artists then want to retrieve their dates already in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the northern Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has already singed a lot and enjoyed as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra with comilitons.
Since then, the Bariton has established itself with his repertoire from strokes and Chansons in the style of the comedian harmonists.
He was often awarded with prices.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just as his success album "For women this is no problem" (2013) - the second place of the charts.
He made it from the nisch to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly climbed and focused on labels, Max Raabe is no longer to think away from the current German-speaking musical landscape.
With the "Good Day, dear luck" program, he has been on Tour. dpa since 2020.

Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created by decoration
The new Bundesbauminister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the distinguishing of large housing companies, as required in Berlin in a referendum.
"With a distinguishment there is no new apartment, it only changes the owner's structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sonday).
My goal is to give rents security that their rent remains payable in the next few years.
A bunch of mix from, for example, private tenants, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition from SPD, Green and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission as to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not just exclude discussions with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further distortions in the rental law.
The coalition contract provides for a rental price brake up to 2029, a limitation of rental increases in voluntary housing markets and the expansion of the lease level.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 dead by tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, many tornados have been drawn through the United States.
Only in Kentucky could be more than 100 dead to complain.
The pictures from there remind us of a war area.
In the evening on Saturday, several tornados have caused severe destruction in the United States and may require up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approx. 320 kilometres of destruction, especially in the member state of Kentucky.
The governor Andy Beshear said, after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was scattered, everything was gone.
Houses, businesses, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is at all possible.
He counts only in the member state of Kentucky with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rise in an hour.

Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for an vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Economic Chamber, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising logans to impf calls - according to the German example - also aims to increase the willingness to corona vaccinations.
He's switched to a company that he's leased over.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It's been a year ago.
He obviously did not get fast at his old place and he was looking for something else.
You can do that.
And that he didn't like you at that time: no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'll do a screen shot.

Help on the first own campaign
Boron to the grace!
I'm just leading the adventure for a group of 4 friends About the Greifenpass and want to lead my heroes in a campaign that is written for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big arc is made to write the wickedness and its motives, designed the individual document, and now I am writing the entrance adventure and stolping over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a firework with cereals from cereals into a small village near the Thuran lake.
There the further action is to be developed.
Some miles away from the village, the hero is supposed to run up a group of Goblins and lock them into a backhold.
I would like to give the players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threats, to recognize the danger early, whatever the players are concerned.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and soils
In case of non-marketing, the Goblins run up the heroes in a hole path and flank at every three left and right bows arm the driver, while two with spears stop the drive.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all consciously found and healed by the son of the village school, a half eleven.
Of course, the carriage is gone.
2. Should a defeat be indispensable, just this half-five with two of his servants and come to help the heroes in the battle.
The carriage is still there, everything great.
How appropriate do you keep Deus ex Machina from solution 2?
Is the encounter as an encounter in the adventure too much?
The Goblins group will play a crucial role later, so it is not only canon feed.
EDIT: wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee that many of your ideas are handled and have more confidence in my narratives now.
I built the lamp out again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway
If you can then let the backlights come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm generated by Sky Sport F1
Hello, dear F1-Fans, over the season, the quality on the German sky has decreased increasingly, so I want to get some air with this post.
First of all, the transfer was cancelled today in the middle of the F2 race in order to start the F1 pre-rapporting periodically.
Although the delayed start and start accident of the schedule was far behind the planning, the last ten minutes (planned) and the mastership decision (!) could still have been shown.
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, F1 has a priority and therefore has to restrict everything else, so that Sky DE has probably no choice here.
Anyway, stupid, especially Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small commendation: the commentary Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation of the severe accident well.
Then, in the F1, there was regular ignorance of the commentators Sasha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you could change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that stairs may change the tyres when there were appropriate radio claims on this topic at Hamilton.
Both commentators immediately knew that there was this option for stepping.
I think that such elementary rules should be easily known if you comment on the F1 at a Pay TV sender.
It is not either the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed, both have merely constant uncertainties on the issue of rules.
Generally, the artificial comment style of roos doesn't like, but admit that the taste is.
But that's where I really like heiko water from TL.
There are constant albens, which make both simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee at (also unintentional) Reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a lot of unrest into the comment he apparently does not take it seriously.
Not least, the advertising simply takes over by Sky, in the exit round is Sky the only sender who goes to the advertising, as you can listen to F1TV, since only the German sound track must come out without comment directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
These two senders also make less advertisements than Sky in the trainings, and that as free TV sender.
Though you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not allow me to look over the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very dull and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking sender who transmits the F1.
Unironic makes RTL a better job in the four races that they may still transfer.
In any case, the grand F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable sender.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On the following: #PRS_ORG#-Pennellight, Messing and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing until now.
The first lady told me that it was sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the substance has a hole at the front of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
ventilator pumps are excellent to provide an aquarium additionally with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via airheaders.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can drive all of them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more exits to connect more excavators.
The MK series has one, two or four exits, depending on the model ventilator pump, but also offers to set a accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curve (see us in the shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure trumpet, mushroom or similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-breaked design and thus provides low operating sounds.
The installation is very easy.
The ventilator pump is connected to an auströmer with 4/6 mm, and it can already be released.
The ventilator pump should be equal to or higher as the water level and should be placed outside.
If the ventilator pump is sitting deeper than the water stand, you should put a relapse valve between them.
Just cut the air door and put the valve between them.
This would prevent if once water would run backwards that would run the water from the basket through the pump...
If the ventilator pump is placed in the outside, you should be covered and protected from moisture as well as other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that use little energy
Even if we specify the processing time of 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are also downloaded daily here.
If everything's going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to avoid a little so that no one is voted, just because it took a little longer.
It would be, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who work in the speculation work... naturally here does not corona hold.
Please don't evaluate as bad just because the delivery is delayed, that's exclusively the package services.
Of course, you'd like to suck about these services, even if we're right now, they're gonna have it fucking hard.
This is also very different in the region.
Be nobody evil, stay healthy, and we all hope that there are better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without arm lean?
Can you also order your legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and modernist to the world room
The daughter of the first US-American in all, a TV moder and four other passengers have made a short trip to the space.
On Saturday they were transported by the Rakete System "New Shepard" of the Blue Origin company by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Starting and landing of the about ten minutes flight took place in the western state of Texas.
Under bright blue sky, Bezos received the freshly cut astronauts after their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometres.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa Astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named the Blue Origin Rakete System, and the 50-year-old TV moder Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company who had four other passengers paid for their tickets: Space Engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not share.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded her father's mission after a short flight.
He had to work hard on his efforts and do everything himself.
She was just so floating, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would prefer to return to all again, said the administrator.
"New Shepard" flys in 100 kilometres of height
The New Shepard Rakete System is largely automated.
The capsule, separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometres above the earth, temporarily with gravitylessness before the re-useable object refrained from large fallscreens.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view 100 kilometres over the earth as a border to the space, but there is no binding international arrangement.
It was already the third crewed all trip from Blue Origin: At the first time in July, the Amazon founder Bezos was on board, along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutch.
In October, the 90-year-old Canadian actress William Shatner, who, with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", became world famous, also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the Deputy Chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Criticals suggest Bezos and Blue Origin to advance the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests in the welfare of mankind and without consideration for the climate.

Perfectly this is in line with :) do I have nothing else to teach?
You just need the tracking number at my mail?
Someone who has been working in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I'm currently studying in the first semester of Biochemie and actually find the industry quite exciting and also in the laboratory isn't disturbing me (has already the anorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I have also informed myself before studying about professional prospects at the time, but also thought that I would certainly want to study and be going to promotion.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially stressing the professional prospects.
On the one side (study check etc) you hear super professional opportunities and the job is totally searched, on the other hand you hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly badly paid places.
That's why I would really be interested:
1) What are you working now?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/payment?
3) What have you studied / What training have you done?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am really uncertain at the moment, and I might consider to discontinue the study in 2022 and make a training as a specialist intelligence.
If you have experiences there, they also like to write times :)
Extra stress before holidays & weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why it's just now.
Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there are great stress in our business.
As it seems, there's also one before holidays plus bridge days.
It was so: last week was Mariä's journey in the sky, which is called "surgery" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day that is semi-official.
So last week it was a long 4-day end in the house.
So what happened last week?
Everywhere stress.
According to e-mails, which have to get out before up, order here, everything *unconditioned* before the long weekend.
Because... yes?
Because "First week then" sounds after so much time and that can't be?
Or because people all seriously want to do as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday then, but also strongly moved.
What is this self-inspiration about holidays?
What do we still have to celebrate if we are not allowed to do so properly?!
The stress did not come from the top, the colleagues were all quite independently so on it.
My question is simple: are only we, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld looks forward to Christmas in Thüringen
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) looks forward to Christmas in its Turkish home, but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest," said the actor and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree with the festival by backing and bastling with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the sensible days, however, she has some to do: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I finally have to get rid of it."
NECTON-Bio supports a smooth running of the mouseers and space renovation.
NECTON-bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and brilliant feather.
The majority of the vessel damage occurring in the birdkeeping should only be due to dietary errors.
As the vessel consists of protein-containing substance, the bird's bird's preservation is particularly rich and balanced in the formation of an unambiguous feather cloth.
For working metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mouse are based on lack of or unbalanced protein imports and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feedingstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NECTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparation should be given.
NECTON-bio is cold water solvent and can easily be administered via the drinking water or the soft feed.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately still not working
DDR Manufacturing Model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the Lok was in use in Schlesien and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive is probably derived from the reconstruction proposal of the model ice trainer ME Heft 11/1968, used with play tracks and failures, see photos, function good, The series E 95 is a heavy product tractor electricomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Schlesian network, perhaps the construction set is also from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are operating
The German Reichsbahn Society had in 1924 commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electrolokomotive, which should be able to transport 2,200 tonnes of coal trains and 530 tonnes of passenger trains at 45 km/h.
As a maximum speed, 65 km/h were required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' Lokomotive with a Tatzlager drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens cabinets with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
Everyone survived the Second World War and then found itself again in the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946, the locomotives came into the Soviet Union as a repair tool.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnenbauwerk Dessau, the rehabilitation of all six locomotives was detected.
[4] In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were built, with the other machines used as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 were preferred to be built in larger numbers.
Only when the E 94 was to see that the number of work could not be further increased, the E 95 entered the viewpoint of the workout.
[4] First, the locomotives were stationed in Leipzig-Wahren train station.
They came to Hall P.
They were mostly used in their own rounding plan before carbon trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematicly, with increasing age, the complex control of the locomotives was shown.
Thus, it often happened that protectors remained sticking in switch handles.
Then the constant bimann with hammer and wooden kil on this locomotive had to re-resolve the gun during the journey.
The damage to the motors occurred often and resulted in monthly accidents at the locomotive.
[5] Since in the late 1960s there were enough new locomotives and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn could quit on old locomotives and most splitter gates, so that the E 95 were dismissed.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn would only want to be onemanly occupied by the German Reichsbahn, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the difficulties of the machinery and the sights of the driver's position.
[5] After the emission of E 95 02 and E 95 03 in mid-1969, they last followed the E 95 01, which quit the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was thus never used.
All Lokomotives were broken up to E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating plant at Halle's main railway station.
It took a while to convince those responsible at the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was retainable as museumlokomotive.
In 1979, the outer construction of the locomotives began to be able to present them to a vehicle view in the RAW Dessau.
[5] She has since been part of the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operative museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was made.
In the DB Museum Hall (Saale) the Lokomotive Museum is maintained.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditional Community Bw Halle P have worked on the operational construction of the Lokomotive.
In April 2015, the Lokomotive could be presented for the first time for an exhibition at the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external laxation, with the transformators being checked and five motors operating.
-The locomotives were in operation on the Slesian Mountain Railway until 1945 and on the decisive side lines, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the medium German network.
The main effort area was first Schlesien
Hand-work model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical reworks required at the Lok in self-work, dust, with gaming tracks, cellar smoking !!!, very rare hand-work model, very small edition- possibly the construction set is also from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may show labels and storage tracks.
Yes, the F parts are it
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle bar is held by two feet.. sufferers are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, unfortunately they are misproduced.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended holding.
So I'll get new ones sent.
When are they sent off?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
That's, according to the assembly instruction, the right of the form, they were just too narrow
But it doesn't matter.
The main cause they fulfill their purpose
With me, they're not flat
Can I get these to you?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
Housing fire with two light damaged and high damage
Two people have been easily injured at a fire in a living house in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage has been caused in the six-digit euro area, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the nearby residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two inhabitants were brought to the hospital on Sunday with light smoking poisons.
The exact fire cause was not known at first, but the police did not go out of a deliberate fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken the further investigations.
It's coming a lot later.
And I have to pay again shipping costs
To disperse Fake News - Biontech-CEO published Impf Photo
Uğur şahin published a photo of his first vaccination early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech-Chef Uğur şahin had not spoken publicly to his vaccine status until now.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo that shows his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him to this, communicated şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur şahin, have published a photo that shows how to receive vaccination against the Corona virus.
There was false information in social media that I was supposed to be not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Žahin on Friday in a contribution in the Network "LinkedIn".
"Since a few months, friends have forced me to post a photo of me on which I is vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
He has so far rejected this because communication shouldn't turn around himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply sad when I learned that an old school friend of me is currently fighting for his life.
He has been fighting a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a breathing device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family weren't vaccinated, they continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fearful, which is often cut by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is only difficult to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In the Internet, an interview circulates with the German wave, where Uğur şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German wave also clarified itself.
"I am currently not allowed to get the vaccine myself," said Žahin at the time.
There is a priority in Germany in the vaccination of vaczine.
In the meantime, the Priorisation has been suspended for a long time - and the Biontech Chief has been injected three times according to appropriate information.
Fire in circumference plant: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, on Friday evening, the light went out: no more electricity and in many cases thereby no heating.
A fire had slaughtered a circumference station.
After a fire with severe damage in a circumvent station, tens of thousands of people have had to get out of the Rhine Sieg Crisis in northern Rhine-Westphalia for about 24 hours without electricity.
On Friday evening, the lights came from 41,000 inhabitants in several communities.
The Career West Network reported that on Saturday, many emergency aggregates had been in operation until the large-scale disorder could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firemen and helpers and THW helpers provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The career thanked the victims for their patience and their helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the municipalities concerned, the circle, the firearms and the THW for the immature use," said the head of the primary technology area, Florian Witt, in a communication on Saturday night.
The repair of damages will take a few days, as the West Network installations were able to take some directions in operation only temporarily, he explained.
A technical defect resulted in the fire after company statements.
Power flows again
The fire that broke out on Friday at 19.15 p.m. has severely damaged the data from Westnet in the Ninkirchen-Seelscheid circumference station Parts of the 10,000 volt-scale system.
There is a need for cleaning and repair work.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 volt volt level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is resumed.
Since Saturday 18 a.m., more than 11,000 people had power again in much and Ruppichteroth.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually switched from 21.30 p.m.
Since 23.15 a.m., the last electricity was still affected by the crash.
More than 80 installations of Western networks and partner companies have been in use.
Following the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"Now it is important that citizens take care of older or alone people in their neighborhood and communicate to local firearmhouses when help is needed," explained Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the creation and operation of emergency aggregates, the inhabitants of Altenheimen were focused.
Moreover, according to public authorities, temporary care sites were established in schools for those who were unable to care for themselves or the power-dependent medical devices need or are required for medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them with you and pay them in euro?
It is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount it on the table plate.
It's custom #NAME#.
There are three statements of it.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
we have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't move it into each other and thus shorten it.
Can you keep helping me there?
Otherwise, I have to send it back, because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy about a feedback
Yes, it's really easier!
Then let's do it like that!
Do you send me the return card via mail?
The repair is now completed.
I had tried this before the chat.
However, before buying, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost unshadowed.
We do not agree with this.
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic Combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid were printed on the Podest at the World Cup in Estonian Otepää.
The Duo once again had to be hit by the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already been launched with great advance after ski jumping into the loipe.
Restoration of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both made s new and use the version 4.5...
may have been that they have already heard of problems more often
Have directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it also seems to be on it.
Soon I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrect to report to the customer service.
As far as I can detect it, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in the meantime.
In order to make the colour order smooth and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, wash out with clear water and dry.
Before you bring the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 stripes.
You can do this on the later unvisible inside of the components or on a yoghurt cup.
The first line on the component
Drag the brush evenly alongside the line.
Light overlapping of the colour layers later ensures a uniform area.
Avoid quick down and down wiping with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden sausage.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could look through later.
Metallic tones and metalic colours come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise it can come to unprecedented metal slides when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you build them.
Originally faithful looks reach the models through the Decals or detractive images.
From high signs on planes through ship names to cider bars and marks on car models: The Decals give the model the last slide.
Bring the Decals in the right order as long as the components are still well to be achieved.
A plane cockpit can be dressed or lighter before it is built into the trumpet.
Even more important than the right tool such as shaving, pinset and tooth plugs are in conservation of time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut each decal individually and fix it.
Decals are also called water skiing images because you fluided their backside with water shortly until the bearing paper is darkened by the nose.
Then you just push the picture a little piece from the paper and put the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you have moisturized before).
While you hold the Decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper side by side.
Warning: Always check if the picture is right before you move it completely from the paper so that it doesn't climb on the finger, knit or even rip.
Suck off excess water with a household cloth.
Not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book shortly as soon as I look at something else, then I don't read the book anymore and I have to log in and reload the book and find the place to where I have read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in three separate packages
Thank you very much.
I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But do I get this back without a problem?
Child wish treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We were some time in child-will treatment, now when it comes to the accounting with the PKV, this is suddenly crossing.
The row after:
We had requested the children's wishing train in advance at the PKV and got the promise over 3 trials.
The experiments were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to get a second child, and we carried out 2 (less) trials, but they did not count on the PKV.
We again requested the cost-taking of the PKV and received three further trials again.
After some further trials (we have done more trials than promised, we logically expect the most expensive with the PKV) we reached the bills at the PKV and got the evil surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3), the PKV wants to repay only 3 trials.
The reason: With pregnancy/born, the other two tests of the first promise are experiencing.
The second wish for children is a new insurance case.
However, according to the AGB, "The insurance case begins with the healing treatment, it ends if treatment needs no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who has the right here to replace the PKV (only 3 trials) or we (there are 5 attempts to replace)?
* Would the PKV have had to point to us in the promises that the further attempts would happen with a birth?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (required by closed egg leaders) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts were to give your opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Please let me get the three variants by email and tell me how to get them the best.
All right.
We will no longer order them.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (equal address), they have obviously lost good customer.
They'd like to forward that to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Last night, the colleague told me that the reimbursement was made and now you tell me I have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can do anything because the commode is completely disturbed
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It is clear that the refund has been made and I have still not received a refund by #PRS_ORG#
You can justify their manager that they have lost two family customers now.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment over his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
A office chair must endure a normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell it as a office chair.
Independently, the guarantee of 24 months shall apply.
No, I can't get another kind of packaging.
I will be able to cut off the cabin and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be advertised with additional hackers, but we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best Low Budget Movies
What is precisely a low-Budget film, there is no general definition with precise budgetary limits for that.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget film** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the network you can find plenty of lists of low-Budget films such as zB on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's the matter with you?
And what might you not like at all?
Is a very good customer of you, already 2 apartments fully furnished with your furniture.
To ask the best price for the grey Ledersofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it reliable now?
Thank you.
With friendly greetings
If there's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 min, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes to the waiting position... I'll give up soon again because it just doesn't work here.
Hello.
"Halber Victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
In conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU may announce a "half victory" to the political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not solved the confrontation, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation Science and Politics (SWP).
This sweep state - Belarus is not very small, but the EU feels like a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Treatment with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Apparently, there is a "increasing normalisation of Pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decisively turn against it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It seems that it cannot be implemented if a Member State is in the head of doing his thing," as is it currently in Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, so Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy was difficulty as the line "Grens protection, border protection, border protection" was strengthened.
Renewd attempt of cross-border cross-border
According to Poland's border protection, migrants have tried to get over Belarus in Polish area.
55 Migrants were arrested on Sunday in the night and brought back to the border, said a spokesman of the Authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been conveyed with stones at the incident near the place of Czeremsza by the migrants.
According to the data, a soldier was faced and had to be medically provided by a military physician.
Overall, border protection 52 tried crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border blocks.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU proposes Alexander Lukaschenko as a powermaster in Minsk to have attracted them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania have seized press reports according to border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of the people to stop travelling there.
The most effective element of the EU reaction is the pressure on the routes, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the scale and demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh ban days and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk also needs to take into account internal policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not in mind that the security device regularly swallows thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial formula 1-finale
Max Verstappe believes that Mercedes has committed two breaks of rule during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula-1 Final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has objected.
The silver arrows suspect the same two breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a suspected infringement of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety-car phase when he was supposed to have overcome regularly.
A second objection was made against the appreciation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes view, the protocol was not regularly followed.
At the last round of Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes, the stairs had been overtaken and had become his first Formula-1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety-car phase in which the Netherlands had taken cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and report again to you.
thank you for support
Free entry for members: Europe-Park organised SC-Freiburg-Fanday
The Europe-Park, namegiver for the Europe-Park Stadium of the Sports Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.

The rear trains lighted through the tricots red and white on this day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect culprits," said the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been cooperation between the Bundesligist and the Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, leisure park.
At the first SC Freiburg fantag in the Europe-Park, the partnership has again shown how well it fits.
To see radiant fans who have shared fun in the backway confirm that," says Europe-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is the €#NUMBER# and not as originally 1699€ ?

I'm sorry because he says he's not an antisemit, that's nothing.
It's like a narrator says he doesn't have anything against foreigners.
You will not admit it both.
But Collegah constantly reproduces some antisemitical messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it complete.
Yeah, then you're not taking any seriousness like Collegah.
Those who seriously question evolution are simply completely lost.
Because of me, a God has set the whole thing on.
But as soon as you are creative, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and the science only crawls.
And so you're a science enemy and not to take seriously like Collegah
To get an optimal viewfield, the luminaire should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The special aplanatical-achromatically designed lensing system allows you to use the luminaire to the edge zone practically forsaken and colourless.
Lupens are often marked with magnification details.
However, these information shall apply only to precisely defined conditions which are rarely in accordance with the conditions of use.
To be able to use your luminaire optimally, we ask you to observe the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (See usage instructions in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - so also in the case of envelopes - light reflexes occur.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective layer.
When compliance with the optimal conditions of use - Lupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less visible.
For further information, see the following instructions for use (in German and English).

Tan sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Agriturismo Frank Diers has experienced so many curiosities at the sale of teeth.
One time a man should have gone home without his partner, because both couldn't agree.
Each year he plants well 2,000 pieces for it.
The 56-year-old has experienced so many curiose situations.
It always makes Christmas a little fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now pay the full price for it.
Then I will assess it accordingly!
We do not need to discuss the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a spinning spider.
So both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be like the "Dreher", which does not sound as delicious.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which has received and sent 50 Mbit up to a few accidents.
The new glass fiber connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to the FritzBox also arrives.
However, on the other DLan module, which sends the Wifi, no longer comes to the full 500, but the more I remove in the house with the module the less comes (i.e. use a stick box that is 1, 2, 3, etc. Rooms from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new glass fiber connection is even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which seems to use a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the DLan, there were similar large losses here.
Could someone explain why with glass fiber so much internet speed about the power line "missing"?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely exciting to put LAN cable in the house.
I'm really desperate, why I created an extra account here.
That is why I would be more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change the giro account
Whoever thought, now would be the first time of rest at the Giro accounts, sees himself deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to be able to reaffirm the fees increases in the past by their customers with all kinds of tricks, the free payments for negative interest continue to fall.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros long.
Now she has just half the free amount and even celebrated for day money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to 50,000 euros on Giro and Investment Accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily money accounts.
However, these lower amounts are now applicable to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a speaker confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with stock customers".
The Commerzbank had already fallen to a limit of 50,000 euros, which are still in force, as well as in ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, who has just been popular with the most cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free amounts to two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks have, according to the numbers of the Internet portal Verivox, a free amount of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: however, there is still a legal conflict with the consumer centres which have even been right against this regulation in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin.
Now, the banks are already discussing whether the institutions may have to form reimbursements - if the upper bodies also have to explain the negative interest in principle to be incompatible and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston works a whole Beauty Army
She's officially at the top of Hollywood.
But your life is like a mountain and valley.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected by the U.S. magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" to the most impressive woman of the year.
For them who made the "Friends" reunion in 2021 and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of her appearance.
After all, Aniston, they take a chip on the day (yes, well read: a chip from the bag).
It is a miracle that you are still flying the hearts of the female and male fans.
Maybe because she's just having fun with luck - and still seeking the great love.
And the baby wish was removed from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she was now being mother.
That hurt her.
People who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medical why I can't.
It was really hurt.
Keep hoping that success and glory will also make happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Rook cans must give up
Kimi Räikkönen's divorce from the Formula 1 left even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out the gloves and wiped the sweat from the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a light band touch, Raikkönen had to put off his alpha Romeo at the great price of Abu Dhabi after not even half of the racendance.
It was his 349. and the last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" finishes his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife, Mintut, and the two children, were also in the United Arab Emirates.
The greatest success of the rhythm was the 2007 World Championship win in Ferrari.
He created 21 Grand-Prix victory, started 18 times from the Pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup Sieg - Nolte wins in the two-bob - Sports
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the target of the Bobpilot.
"I've done this once, I've had to go in nine and a half victory per season, then I could do it until Cortina 2026," said the double-Olympiasier from BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
Only on Saturday he resisted the attack of John Lochner by five hundred points, in which he went from rank three to one.
Then he changed something to the material setting and went out a bigger spring on Sunday at 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he spent before the British Brad Hall.
==References====External links==
"We have gone more risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22th victory in series.
The Berchtsgaden John Lochner, who traveled for Stuttgart, came to place two of the time before this time on rank five.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed at rank four in the first race on place eight.
"If I knew what he did differently, I would do it like that," said Lochner.
Nolte with Home Victory - Podium for Jamanka
With the women Laura Nolte picked up the third season victory in the twoerbob on her homeway.
After it was only enough for the fourth place in the Monobob on the morning, she rushed to the World Cup on Sunday at the German three-fold success with Anschieberin Deborah Levi.
Twoerbob-Olympiager Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen came with Germany's fastest Sprinterin, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, on rank two.
Besides her Olympia qualification, she booked the first podest place this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed on place three with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podest in the world cup, I'm super lucky that Mariama takes me.
I'm very happy with the development.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but the start time was okay today," said Burghardt and stressed: "It's not just a move, but there's also a lot to do there".
Jamanka was a little angry about the non-complete riding, but he said, "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the ceiling in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What do you want me to do?
I just didn't get it and therefore I couldn't solve it, why I finally asked.
Through Corona, I had quite different problems last year and never time for it.
And now he said he was expired what really hurts me.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seat bank.
I would like to give it back and order it again, as it is just reduced :)

No only when I get on it a extra field with the message
I was removed from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I also sent you pictures of the misleading being.
But we want the regal module anyway, just a new unbreaked
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello dear girls and girls and women,
I have something I just want to write, and maybe it's the one - or others like that...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dogemama - even except that my dog doesn't scream or go into the kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has recovered a burning 2 degrees on Monday and has been depressive for years (but is now in therapy).
Last night I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we've cooked a lot and it was beautiful.
I helped him shower (some hand is in the band wg burning).
He is chilled above three and we are currently seeing less (1-2x week) which makes me very much to do with my needs for love and love.
My dog's just got abdominal wounds, I cooked for him, and now he's lying in his cushion deck, and it's a little relaxed after I was there with the heat lamp and strangling for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and it's just gone for a month.
Now we still have homework on us, which we of course share.
But even cooking is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just very well-defined, I am halfway well-treated and get right.
Not good, but I'll be right and I'm almost free of symptoms.
My uni just demands a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I haven't done anything more and overmorrow anatomy hours for which I should at least prepare something for.
And next week I have a oral test right on Tuesday, and what happens then stands in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room anymore.
So my week goes like this: only until over morning, then it's weekend.
But afterwards, the whole thing goes on?
Just until the birthday.
Only until vacation starts.
Only until weekend.
Just until...
And that's what's going on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'm packing it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but otherwise I can't...
Are you all right?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't say that at all.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think that has some to do with the Mental Load of Women, and that's why I thought I'm sure I'm going to find passionate girlfriends here...
I wish you another relaxing evening, the week has almost been done!
I've got my order today unfortunately is the whole other colour plus surface is cracked and table leg has printed.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We're very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to exchange the table, I'll get another color or how?
The cancel e-mail was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
Two times in the rest.
But she was not confirmed.
Something else: At the time in school, I found that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is for them only another subject such as mathematics or earth science.
For me, this was always a little weird, perhaps even because I was raised Christianly and I always believed somehow.
How do you do that?
Perhaps you can also tell about colleagues and students with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate.
It also gives a curriculum, etc.
But just find it strange to have a physicist who does not believe in the theory of relativeity.
Then what brings you to want to learn religion if you do not believe it?
True culture or something?
Hope you're a question isn't too private.
Can't change it or not?Write English I also understand it well
It's been a long time, then I'd stop it.
It's good, thank you.
I'll expect to return until the beginning of the next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Video Search Help Please
Hello, dear guys,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (with 24).
I think it's been a movie for youths.
In the film there are two timeachs (or parallel worlds).
Firstly, the modern world (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not sure).
Since I can't describe it anyway in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross themselves, and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this empire to live myself, I mean.
The transition is also the grave place of the soldier.
At the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that's what you say I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one has been sleeping only on the abdomen from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
A child like that is much more tolerant than you think.
Make sure everything's right around there, no cushion animals, often go in and watch, but not minutes of surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
Don't kiss.
Achso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a cover.
Watch your child when it's sleeping.
Is it turning the head to the side?
Can it get out of your stomach?
Or is it in front of the face right in the mattress?
You can figure out if everything's all right.
We are also all grown up and when my husband came to the world, it was corridor and dare to put the kids on the abdomen to sleep.
In addition, we are already "Stammkunde" with you and have already bought a lot of articles
But why are you offering me just 20 euros?
Hello, I've already written with a colleague from you yesterday and I haven't been backing up until now.
It's about my dressing cabinet that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently to be used.
To make it clear.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
But it's just that this sender's policy is now under all sau.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go to large bed tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet sender.
Citate Arno: You want "not to be an ongoing lithas column".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertiser trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elitefan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they may continue to offend people.
A Krogman who is completely missing empathy and at the expense of the action with the exploded hired rooms try to make ashes.
How do you find this all right?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I'm asking for a Rueck call, because my delivered wooden table was defected.

Whether as a comforter with abdominal wounds or just for cushion – My little warmth friend is diversely entranceable.
Kirschkern kisses are a traditional home for well-equipped heat applications, as Kirschkerns can take warmth very well and dossed again.
The removable interior can be easily warmed in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel secure, even if they do not feel so good.
The Kirschkern kiss with reference is only suitable for the following applications:
Before warming the kiss on untypical smells, stocks or fires, check and immediately dispose of at present.
Please take the inner cushion for warming out of the reference in advance!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watt for max. 2 minutes (Note the details of the microwave manufacturer!)
Just after heating, the heat can be distributed in the kiss evenly by guns!
Afterwards, put the interior in the context.
In the first heating, the surface may have a light humidity formation but disappears in repeated applications.
Keep on to the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (deflammation and burning danger!).
Before warming the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the warmed indoor cocks have been placed back in the reference, please check the temperature of the cushion to suit babys (max. 43 °C) on your bracelet!
Do not use the cushion in acute and chronic, inflammatory or fevery diseases, circulation problems, fresh haematoms, haemorrhage and open wounds as well as in people with reduced pain sensitivity.
In the case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, tumour and pregnancy, please contact a doctor before taking.
If nails have been opened and loose cores are released, remove the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible for children.
If the product is used in babies below 1 year, the child’s temperature should be monitored regularly during use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents associated with the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The reference is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years of age) was no longer loaded by my network part.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so I should still work.
I thought that the net part alone was enough to operate.
The battery is empty and the laptop is no longer launching despite the broken net part.
Then I developed the battery, but nothing happens here too.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network operation?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?

Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack of Peak Design no problem!
20 litres of capacity also swallows larger photo equipment without problems that can be safely stuck with the polated FlexFold parts.
And what else you need on everyday items, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configured interior, remains well organized and separated from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2), the series still presents itself in a new look.
With the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliablely protect the backpack's interior and still give access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two ways: once conventionally over the cover cap that can be closed with the MagLatch shutdown system, an excellently thorough solution for effective protection that has already proven at the Messenger Bags.
In this case, there is a locking cap of metal with appropriate anchor bar on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought about different "fuel stocks", because there are 4 anchor bars, stablely destroyed in which the caps can be captured.
If the backpack is loaded full, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper.
Clap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be safely closed without entering the hooks.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other, photo-ruck bags: Besides the cover cover, there is still a rip locking opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the most disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from the top - you don't have to wander through the content anymore!
At the same time, this smart detail increases the daily durability of the backpack enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel bags.
In the Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the inner space (more below) and thus easily separate both from each other - and access it independently through the two side openings.
You can also draw the backpack from the right side of the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right main square, while the everyday stuff stays safe in the left backpack and do not come between them.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable bearing belts help.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is completely made of 100 % recycled, waterproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is supposed to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately I was waiting for the email of her support.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When is the article delivered?
Order and payment was 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, I'll just give up a bigger order, but yet I kept the damaged furniture piece and not sent back.
And that the last year was different from thought, I couldn't know and have just not solved it timely and clarified it.
But I have the damage as a customer, and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the claims of the dynamic driver, reliability and safety of the brake even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of guss and then mechanically processed (bounded and cut).
All tinted discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are owned for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is drawn up, which is directed by equivalence of the disc to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The so-called discs ensure high comfort and brake efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of brake discs and brake clots.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted discs thus underline the character of each car by attractive and noticeable appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event characterized the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered bricks in the water at the southern gift of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and dissolved the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from Nah and Fern and made Coloma one of the fastest and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were stuck, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share in the wealth of the country.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks riches in the West and wants to make a name.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, assemble horses and build businesses.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding river runs and surrounding areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overcome your pioneer colleagues in order not to go with the rest of them Pleite.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
At the same time you choose your actions, you have to build households with your resources and a tableau which is more and more "worked" for you (the so-called "motor building").
The buildings on your Tableau allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules to your favors.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual style by using fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a three-year period of 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained official stateality).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will be secretly selected and at the same time select a location on the playground where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is discovered and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, he gets a block!
This disables half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then, the players perform various actions, such as the winning of resources, the movement of cars, the establishment of tents, the search of rivers, the construction of bridges, the opening of businesses and the positioning of revolverers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the prizeer turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This continues so long until the prize has moved five times, so every location has once covered and ends the year.
There is a shooting where the players have to defend Coloma before an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have accompanyed enough revolve heroes and are countlessly superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
But if they fail, they receive less rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation is done.
The player wins with most winpoints!

"Why children are not tyranns" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW psychic violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentation has appeared today in my Twitter timeline, and I just looked at it.
>The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a nice guest in Talkshows and holds talks throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyranns" (2008) he triggered a violent educational debate.
Former patient: women and educators are now causing serious objections to him.
Please take care of you, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible ones must never go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child free space for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is in the situation meaningful and possible.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the disappearance of the test requirement for three times vaccinated
At their next meeting, the Ministers of Health of the countries wish to decide on a widespread loss of the test requirement for three times vaccines.
"We countries need clarity quickly, whether and from when the test obligation can be missed for three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministerial Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The loss of 2G plus for three-fold vaccines is "not only medically useful, but also provides an additional vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Minister for Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) agreed that he would make a proposal to the Ministerial Conference on Health on the next Tuesday. − Afp
So I want to send the lamp back
How am I doing the best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat area is.
Can you help me?
I can't deal with my #PRS_ORG# anymore.

What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. senses under full narcose.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
Most commonly, it comes to hearing noises/tips, rarely to see pictures and most rare to see pain.
Relevant for this topic: Emperor cuts are surgery associated with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very depth narcosa to protect the child until the abdomen.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the narcose prespeaking.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment by me describes Awareness correctly, but had no** u/Nitemarex **per definition.
Didn't read her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ will not help us either.
These are legal guarantee claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take the defective chair back.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is standard in the eCommerce area.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
We're losing a lot of money.
I already sent you a mail that you didn't answer.
The question again.
In order and on the account, the product is delivered to a room of my choice.
The Spediteur is the company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me they were only delivering before the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know a person who can wear the heavy furniture on the first floor.
I'm not going to call you?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old died
He was a theatre critic and an inspector.
Later he wrote a monumental theatre story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freezed: "An old man gets older."
The shocking diary of a slow separation from the world, which led by the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the message comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is, "I've already witnessed my life thanks here".
There are various types of palettes.
One of the most common is Europe-leads, standardized wooden pallets, which are used in particular in the European area as charging carriers.
They are certified by the European Paletten Association EPAL
According to Statistics Austria in Austria, in 2020, over ten million pieces of pallets were produced.
The production value was € 79 million.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually, not collected
New York takes the MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular playtime against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the 11-meter shooting with 4:2.

Rouded Tips & Tricks
I had got a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect castle.
That was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butterzart!
So thank you again :)
Now I came to taste and I want to cook to Silvester for the first time Rouladen.
Tomorrow I'll set up a cattle fund for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have a oven, but just a big pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is no longer so good, but I get that
IEs is a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed on the 18th 01th e-mail that the reimbursement was made.
But until today, the money hasn't come to me.
Please check it out.
Where there are in the room Lübeck or Christmas bread
For many people, gans or ente belongs to Christmas days such as the tan tree and the gifts.
You didn't get any poultry yet?
Now the time will be short.
We tell you where you can get a Christmas bread in Lübeck room.
The "drive" of a pipe end level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar enhancer sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor scaling.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired mirror and, on the other hand, the broken content of your sounds.
In addition, the VT+ series enhancers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on "Gain" and the distortion.
In addition, it already sounded that the POWER LEVEL regulator can even fix a performance reserve if it goes unfamiliarly loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL regulator, the whole potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone books can also be used as a line output.
The signal in question is processed with a box simulation, so that you can get an eminent "akustic" sound impression even when you use a headphone or direct recording.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX book so that you can jack to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
In addition, if you spend a VFS5 footer, you can also call the sounds comfortably by foot, switch on/off the effect blocks, and take the speed of the compatible effects as a result.
This is essential for the live effort.
With its new power packages VOX goes another step in the future!
But that was what others saw.
Then can you send the lamp back?
Because she hangs too low for over a dinner table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you continue helping me?
What about the commode?
Do we receive a update to the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it can't, I would be satisfied with a leave or a voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need are a lot then a lot.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Mirror (door) on the planned hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not rewarded
Is there a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
The negotiations on the resurrection of the International Atomic Agreement have progressed according to Iranian data.
"Beide sides are short to agree on the topics to be on the agenda," said Iran's Chief Dealer Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the News Agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development" because at first there was no agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement aims to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday the Vienna discussions on the renewal of the agreement had been continued after just one week of interruption.
The negotiators of Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France and Russia participate in the negotiations.
A U.S. delegation is also involved in the negotiations in Vienna, but only indirectly.
Thüringen overthrows Sachsen - Freistaat now Bundesland with the highest corona-incidence
Thüringen has dissolved Saxony and is currently showing the highest incidence in the bottom.
As the only country, the value is above the brand of 1000.
As the only country, Thüringen was located over the brand of 1000 at the Corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute indicated the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which was last always the highest incidence in the bottom, this value was 990,5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thüringen had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
Within one day, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2-virus and 16 other deaths associated with an infection were reported in Thüringen.
200 people who were severely ill in Covid-19 were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
In weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and have hardly come back with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery takes place only at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it out and stick to the package and put it out at the mail, that wasn't it?
I don't have to click on/indicate/fill here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid. That's why I write to you.
I would like to take the return on my own costs.
8 euros return fee is a freak in my eyes.
It's time for changes
###MBundesday is greeting me, I am u/StratorDE at the Plenarsaal in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBH, you can find one: it is not existing.
We came into a winter star and extended the summer hole to a few months.
#Where's the problem?
Yeah, what did it mean?
Mostly, this would simply be related to dissatisfaction, as some things have been done here and as we are in general.
In the last few days, the impression has been increasingly shown that many people here really still have bock on the MBundesday.
#What we need to change
In this place, the Community has been asked about the monthly day which would like to keep it alive.
The infringement came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last days and has found one, simply said, screws.
After some writes, several people from the community have been found who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to expressly call on everyone to take part in this project, but that is the only way that this project can also exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange each other, as well as specific things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBHS day work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed/adjusted/removed?
* How should we be outward in the future?
* How should new members be acquired?
* How do we create a fair election system?
I am pretty sure I forgot some things, but what is not bad, we have the discord at the end.
If you have pleasure and time, come on the discord, work with us and let us decide democraticly about the future.
I've ordered a lamp screen with you that's still delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/cloud for it and not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered you another hang.
I put it together and then noticed it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are they also in oversize, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the incorrect cabinet is picked up in time.
And I'm asking you to make it happen now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will unmount the barrier as far as possible for pick-up - they have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work then.
#PRS_ORG# can be able to contact me at any time by telephone to agree on a pick-up date.
Is there a instruction for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get this or decide for the return?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She's been living vegetarian for a while, but it's probably very rarely eating meat.
I myself was also a few years ago vegetarian.
On the question whether I've always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarism has been a planned intermediate step, I have answered honestly without considering much.
And although I long thought that as a vegetarian, I would support the welfare of the animal, but at some point reflected and understood that I finally also supported animal misery.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression that came out on her side of misfortune, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and it was reduced as a vegetarian animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was to 'plump'?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are swiftly put into a corner as a veganer and come up conflicts without putting it on it.
It greets a harmonious veganist (;
It is clearly not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not disconnect from the legal requirements for remote sales.
I am on the date on which #PRS_ORG# my restoration is not picked up on site.
Unfortunately, because I cannot be in place because of a funeral, this cannot be changed.
Can you get me an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I'll always meet again.
Lahnsteiner War for water rescue equipped: 45,000 Euro subsidie from the country
Recently, Rhinenland-Pfalz's interior minister Roger Lewentz in the Lahnsteiner Rathaus delivered an admission notice of EUR 45,000 for the new apparatus car Water saving of volunteer firearms Lahnstein to Colonel Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rhineland-Pfalz supports us in this regard," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The apparatus car is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Pfalz.
Over and under water they fulfil tasks in water and ice recovery as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a permanent calculation of increasing efforts: The tree of the hotel shipping on Rhine and Mosel, as well as the continuing use of the Lahn as a leisure flow, contributes to this.
I bought a book that I could only read at 10% and then the problems began.
I can't open the book.
However, I followed their recommendations have synchronized, removed and the app reloaded NOT has worked.
I'm a little frozen because the whole action has been taking me a lot of time and I'm now hoping for help.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection from #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter a date in the order process?

Thank you for the first time that you put the whole thing here, I also spent nearly a decade in a similar activity in government service, and we were also gun carriers in the executive, I don't want to go into it!
The question of right and left is always very simple.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the government minister comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in special uniform and arms feeding people right from conservative magic should also be clear to everyone that these people can then naturally deal with the living reality is also clear, because you have, besides the average white, now many Germans with migration backgrounds, women and also homosexuals (and so I do not mean the excessive feminine clichés now, because in the executive there are more than not but quite normal men and women to whom you do not notice it if they can tell you it) and also on these people, and I have to leave myself, because in doubt they save your life or set this for you.
But even these margins are represented, even if it is the first time that my experience sounds comic after a conservative attitude, is proud of Germany and is rather less abducted by excessive left policy, although this policy is supposed to be used for them or thinks it needs to be right for them, they simply want to be treated quite normally.
Back to the right, because of course the police and forces are also a cross-section of society, extreme rights will also be found there, but they can openly say their opinion there, or even openly embrace any state-threatening plans is totally excessive and irritating me too.
Of course, it happens that police and soldiers who were often in foreign efforts often start to pause because of negative experiences and even say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that the right gender also meets a rainy exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, I believe that this is a good fight against and also against political education and education!
Germany is so very internationally enthusiastic, and this is also good in my view that we could not afford to have right racialists and Nazis in our series!
Yeah, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you can deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black still to Germany or this basket is available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But at the top of the part of the wood are two deep candles, filled with something yellow.
and on the mirror itself is a small crater
Ordinant by child?
Hello, me (w32) has been working on a thing for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (in self-employed, very little leisure), but for my life I get more bad than right to my household to keep it clean and clean.
There are always stages in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I clean up and put.
But it's never really so "that someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is not better (patient) even, although it disturbs me somewhere but mostly loses home simply against work and distress.
The kitchen is still the most regularly cleaned as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you done it with a child more orderly?
We haven't done anything yet, but this question has been working for me.
Because I have no incentive for me, it just doesn't bother me as long as no visit comes and, for example, always fresh clothing is there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger stimulus with a child, or do you stay stupid?
Look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality and anatomically advanced cut, provides a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further imprinting of the joints for improved freedom of movement (in arm and knee bows)
To Focea Comfort 4 the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to increase comfort.
Nearless Stretch pans on the joints reduce the smoothing (accels, arm and knee bows)
High quality shapes in the lower back and in the step provide a close, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch pan in the lender wrestle range increases flexibility around the back rhino closure and thus improves comfort, especially when hooking and mounting and mounting the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex zone around the shoulders and on the back is guaranteed to increase flexibility in movements of the arms and the back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-reduced material with a special surface structure, which offers high degrees of cooling protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Non-naive, thin (-2 mm) density on the face of the haube increases comfort, density and durability (separate headhead)
Weak, cracked zone improves the density with a finely adjustable broadening through a flexible, spacious closure which does not belong to the boxing or the nails
Double mantles with crack locks on arm and foot joints connect a coverable inner mantle with a soft, cashed neoprene outer mantle
45° Incarbation at the end of the inner manchet for increased elasticity and loadability when attaching.
Long ribbed cap on the neck with an elaskin enhancement, for an anatomic cut with increased comfort at all without haube

Borders of the outer manchets swept for greater loadability
Borders of the inner manchets carved for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer at its place, especially when deeper divings (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have made a training in the field of software development and have been trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right thing for me, why I have been thinking about restarting and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiety avoiding) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means that I don't have a sense of self-value, and I'm therefore scared.
I have no problem talking to people at a real level, but I find it very difficult to conduct more loose conversations and I have been told more often that I work inadequately (which I think I've already improved).
Can I become social workers like that?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or in an open youth approach, but rather in, for example, the advisory or family aid.
But I don't know if the concrete working everyday is really the way I imagine it is, and it's hard to find something on the Internet.
In my job, the EVPS already leads to problems (for me, emotionally), because every time I have something to do with my code ("remaining the easiest things") and I find it difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should now really know how to do this"/"I think it with my stupid questions off from work"/"the one really thinks I'm really less complicated" etc.).
I'll probably have the problems in every profession but I wanted to have mentioned it instead.
But you've already kept the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for a date for pick-up
What do they mean to return, please !
If I have downloaded a book on the #PRS_ORG#, your #PRS_ORG# not authorized this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, he asked me if I had a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein incorporated with the feed breaks the bird into the individual proteins (amino acids) in its stomach drill and builds from them its body-own proteins, which it also needs for fermentation.
The feather formation of the nesting and the bird renovation of the mausing bird is extremely complex and associated with a particularly high demand for the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NECTON-Bio should not be administered during discipline, as otherwise there may be disturbances in the breakthrough.
Following this curious administration of NECTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparations) and NECTON-MSA (mineral preparations) should be reconstituted.

1 g NECTON-bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft feed.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/weight feed as the bird consumes daily and to switch water/food daily.
A stretched measuring leaf (inland) corresponds to 1 g NECTON-Bio.
In the case of severe veder damage, the double or three-fold dose of NECTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of space renovation is visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is sufficient until the site renovation is fully completed.
Storage: NECTON-bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is sold as a office chair.
How can a office chair go broken after 9 months?
The guarantee claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really a very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to tell you that my order has arrived damaged and images were attached.
Did you receive this e-mail?
Statement of a communal employee in reversal to the Statute
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A whale tree is supposed to be liked on our property.
So case requests to the municipality.
An employee writes me that the cases of fruit trees and thus the whale is not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the Walnuss is explicitly indicated as a protective tree.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On one side, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use them new packaging for it.
I didn't receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a resignation or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that only the question is whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the ceiling to Germany.
Can you check this?
Eil Notification: Severe traffic accidents in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident on the St 2179 has occurred between Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police's press alarm is currently announced (14:03) a car has arrived in the counter traffic.
There are injured people.
I understand.
All right, then thank you again for doing so easy!
Council and ideas for further professional life
For the first time happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good because my favorite head just breaks everything you can break.
Before I get out of here .. shortly: I need advice and the best of people who know my situation somehow - so from you.
I'm just making the Ref as a cross-stage.
I originally studied something else and worked there in a field (to stay at least a little anonymous, I call nothing more precise here).
But then it was too boring to me and I looked at alternatives that could make me more fun.
Sometime I landed at the teaching office and was sure it is - even though the framework conditions are clearly more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I arrived at the third "I google other postal tenders".
And it's only half a year.
On the paints before, I always decided to continue and at least to end the Ref, afterwards I can still turn around.
But at the moment I'm absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I've been totally out of time.
Now there's holidays, but there's still a bunch of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there was my weekend and my celebration evening.
That's where I was free.
And the stress at work did not matter at the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these stare structures that are more nervous to me.
Basically, it makes fun and viewed from outside, the Ref also works well as the feedback and so on.
But I'm totally laughed and wondering how much stress my body holds before he makes it completely closed - if he doesn't do it right now.
I wonder if I would like to have this for the rest of my life - just if I read some contributions from you here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, since where I was appreciated, could take free time if I needed it, and the work was somewhat boring, but was paid appropriately for it and together in a team that worked out and not as a single fighter like that now is the most time the case.
But then I wonder if in a year I haven't arrived again in the same place as now and I'm dissatisfied.
You realize it's all somewhat weird, but maybe you've come out as an external advice or ideas, as I am out of this situation that I'm totally finished and starting to cry at the lowest thought.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, that's enough for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the weird undertone of me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clarified.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has developed steadily, which has, among other things, led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" sculpture, with which the behaviour of a tube amplifier is perfectly formed.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely up to the latest state of the technology in matters of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp scales, the VTX enhancers are waiting with a authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-step Valvetronix tube preampler.
This is partly based on real analogue circuits because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this elevated switch, the VTX enhancers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only spray.
With the "Tone Room" software of VOX, you can even correct and blend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been multiplied since to meet newly added sound requirements, which has resulted in anno 2010 again in a performance shift of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved enhancer models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed so that all guitarists are found in search of a maximum volume of sound here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuancated playback of play dynamics and satanic attacks as well as a prompt speech.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers have discovered that the end-level determines the tube character of a amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor recorded with a 12AX7 tubes of any VT+ enhancer is perfectly the behaviour, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points of Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA persists.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his elderly brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 at Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main case is also adaptable: with three individual plazier- and fitting clip-lock parts it is fully adapted to the need for your photo equipment and is suitable for any kind of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What finally fits in the backpack, of course depends on the size of the camera and the objective.
A possible deposit would be a DSLR camera with an attached objective, two to three interchange objectives and an instance flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave space for further objectives.
In addition, you can still take a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras of Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Serie) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photo-familiar things.
Drohnen pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulcan outbreak at La Palma: probably longer history
In the nearly three months since the beginning of the outbreak, the Lava flows on the Canary Island have caused major damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days now, the volcanic outbreak on La Palma has been the longest in the famous history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
The outbreak of the Vulcan Tehuya in 1585 was considered to be 84 days long on the Atlantic island in front of the West Coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
Although the activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly over the past days, volcanologists still have no chance to predict when he could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best message is that they are stable," said the President of the island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, State TV sender RTVE.
Injuries in millions
In the nearly three months since the start of the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees hot Lava has destroyed nearly 2900 dwellings and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a metre thick lava layer.
That's almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, two new landings with a size of about 50 hectares were created by cold Lava.
Especially the extremely important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the about 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and was already in the crisis before the volcano outbreak.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper El País.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is before the door, and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have been associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the cracking tension a little tricky at itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that our increasingly split society still holds together.
The more important is it to become aware of the Christmas tradition of donation, so that the gesture of donation, which has been a peaceful "society contract of natural people" after the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Muss, can be refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How the Christian son of Nikolaus became
Strictly, it was the Protestants, through which Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Previously on the Nikolaus Day, gifts were transferred to some kind of kind.
The background of this still popular site is that the Holy Nikolaus, as an bishop of Myra, has poured three women secretly into their windows in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of donation, the popular practice in Germany showed to fill the boots, especially the children with gifts.
Protestants stood at this custom because they rejected mediators between God and human beings as "the worship of sanctuary".
For these reasons, they are against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian son of Nikolaus and founded a new tradition line.
The focus of the donation was thus shifted to the sanctuary.
However, since most Protestants do not see such details anymore, only the least is indignant that the use of the Holy Nikolaus is similar to Martinssingen and Martinsing and Martinsturn still a solid part of the pre-Justice period.
Today, you can find all the luxury clocks that the heart desires in steples in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to desired luxuries.
Various traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of donation since the 13th century on the day of the Holy Nikolaus.
With the reformation, the day of donation moved to sanctuary.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a joyful cowboy about the question who is now bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christian son appears on the Holy Evening or the Christmas man, in principle a kind of Nikolaus, which has been assigned some types of property in time.
These include, for example, his white roaster, which has only little common with the rather strict assyria of the historical figure, its slides that are drawn from retirement and the preference of the Kamin to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the Holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at Christmas celebration.
In Spain the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana that should have guided them the way to the son of Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes fabels bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought father Frost to some fame.
It's not a retire, it's three horses who take its slides as Troika.
In Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Wars of Hussites, the Christian son is responsible for giving gifts.

Police shoots suspicious bananas near the king's palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told me that callers had reported a man who should have gone into a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
The man, according to the authorities, fled in a vehicle that could be stopped a little later by officials.
It had fallen shots and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the crime scene.
The police didn't go out of a terrorist background.
There are several messages in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

On the other hand, “Smart Stone” is very harmless: the sun alone is making this sunlight fabulous – optionally in white or coloured light (in equal to six different colours).
The endless, amorphe design is consciously selected: like a naturally shaped large cube presents this modern light object at day.

Set the “light stone” to any place that is shined by the sun on the day.
Two supplied soil spiders ensure fixed stop if necessary.

In the event of incumbent damping, “Smart Stone” begins to shine self-determining; in which colour you decide yourself: six attractive light colors are for your choice – besides daylight white.
Finally, the shutdown will also happen automatically once the battery load level has decreased to a specified minimum or it will be light again.
Once the sun appears again, the charging cycle begins the next day from front.

Pillen Problem
Hello, dear woman's people,
I hope I do everything right here, is actually my first post after a year reddit.
To my problem: I've begun to take the pills about five years ago, especially because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this again because I have to take enough medicines through chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
At my last about two-year break, I had got from 0 to 100 explosive pickle and this everywhere.
As far as the surface is, but I've been very busy, and I didn't feel well.
In the two years of pause, everything has never really normalized.
Maybe someone has any hints to avoid this once.
My cosmetics are free of parfume and without pounds, but maybe there's what anyone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, women's doctor has not taken me so seriously and skin doctor's date is still coming.
Many love thanks to each one who read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had prebupertaire severe neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale knee fleet and the acne topic.
Food I also tried everything possible in the course of chr. disease and remained hanging down on sugar, milk and meat poor mixing food because otherwise nothing worked so well.
It can also be good that hormone is simply the worm inside, but if you have like me everywhere you want to stop looking for what else is wrong.
I already had all of her colleagues semina o.a.
Written and now I lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my concern.
I always have to work at the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong

110-kV earth cable is rebuilt 2022
The approval for placing the new high voltage cable at Tann is legally effective.
The planned decision of the government of Niederbayers opens the way for the construction that will begin in 2022.
This was now communicating to the network operator Bayernwerk.
The earth cable for about seven kilometres will connect the tennis station in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt direction between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mass of the free line.

Ref: Plan education (EK)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the Ref since summer, the education makes me fun, but I've still had great problems to plan my lesson in the field of earth science.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I can in principle only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In school, I can also copy only s/w free of charge (which's nervous).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the issue of geofactors, and I actually stand for myself every hour.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple classes (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always go out of the goal of learning (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build this up (mostly I create a magazine with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore, the work sheets also.
Maybe I can do a geographic teacher how to work with the book.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I actually decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would really like to disable the retour as soon as possible.
Trade fears about Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most shops, only who has been vaccinated or healed may be allowed.
The trade considers that this is unnecessary and complains about turnover breaks.
He also has a possible solution.
The 2G regulations, from the viewpoint of the trade association Germany (HDE), destroy the important Christmas business to the retail.
In the case of transactions with products of non-day need, turnover breaks should be complained, HDE head of business was criticized by Stefan Genth.
According to a current HDE survey among 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively on the remainder of the year.
Many would have already cancelled the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive peak of the year is now often a hole without soil," said Genth.
Therefore, traders with 2G access restrictions lost almost one third of their pre-crisis rates over the past week.
It only runs well in retail food and online.
The Association demanded consequences of dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the main manager.
"2G when buying does not bring us forward in the fight against pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations scared customers and required high staff effort.
He demanded that the banquet system be approved in abundantly.
After that, every customer had to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or healed) only once and had access to all businesses with the given band on that day.
In addition, in retail trade - as already in public transport in the 3G rules (vaccinated, healed or tested) - sample checks should be sufficient.
The German Euroshop specialized in shopping centres also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at over 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the sales were approximately 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the midst of the so important Christmas business," said director Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economy Week".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the Centre is trying to find and approve solutions.
This includes the so-called bundle solution, where "the visitors, for example, can make their 2G-note at a central place in the center once and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - uncrashed all businesses". dpa
I recently got the #PRS_ORG# ordered and delivered.
The mirror has a crater and in the frame is also an error that was tried to be cashed with a yellow filler.
That looks unpleasant.
I would like to give back the mirror and have already packed it back into the package.
How do I have to go on for the ride now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour return.
To adjust the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities provides.
Besides adjusting the brightness there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and art light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitively operated.
The light produces a very light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flimter free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees with which you can illuminate large surfaces at relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the colour temperature.
It is a great tool to work both at the film set or at the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted on difficultly accessible places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of keys and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting as a percentage and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the delivery range)
User Storage The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply by pressing longer one of the storage keys will be occupied and finished.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the known situation is resumed when newly activated - Very practical for studio work if the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of the DL3120 functionality results in the possibility of the operation with favourable NP-F battery.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera men (and women) - so you can take back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check, before the set, whether the battery has sufficient power - it is a battery test equally installed with - for each of the two battery stations a value in the two displays (the left battery above display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is naturally possible to continuously supply the lighting lighter over the supplied power component.
The construction of the lighter is very easy.
You have a 16mm hill as a connection for fixing, so you can get directly to your photo stativ.
The inclination is to be reliably adjusted by designers on both sides.
It was considered that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for long-life and hard use.
In addition, a nail gelk is included in the range of delivery.
This is also a pocket in the scope of delivery.
This allows you to safely transport or store the light with all the accessories you may want to buy.
Damage, I got it and she's too small :(
"Party that we wanted to beat": Frankfurt celebrates after a magnificent comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series of Sieglosen Hessen were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga-Pleite.
But then the SGE turned up, shot within a good hour the frustration over a mature season start of the soul and conquered furios with 5:2. "It is crazy what the boys have done today," trainer Oliver Glasner joyed at DAZN and spoke a "Pauschal-Lob, to everyone who was with us."
At the beginning it looked after a new damper for the Frankfurter who now stands on rank nine still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkusener with 2:0.
What happened then, also impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," says Glasner.
I am incrediblely happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Christopher Lenz, who had been able to stand back on the spot for the first time since the fourth game day and his overcoming muscle injuries, stressed the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result especially for the spectators.
That's the party we wanted to take today.
But now Glasner wants to keep focus on the future tasks, but it also looks good for the personal situation.
It is extraordinary that we all have fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It's top work in our medical department, but also the players live high-professional.
Now you want to "go on step for step and remain modest" and the tasks to "take through at this level until the year's change".
Next, on Wednesday, during the course of the English week, there is an outward game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky) on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my side.
I tried to call at #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent to me again immediately, or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and give up the order again?
I would unfortunately say that I will not be ordered again because it has been a long time.
Have they ever been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damps for handball women in front of quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's handball women swallowed after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views from the parkett.
In order to complete the WM headquarters, the DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers had to hit Spain in the quarterfinal.
"We were too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," judged Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we have to stand differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany concluded the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind the Danish (10:0).
I'm sorry we couldn't take the Flow.
This was a bad game from all of us," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entry into halffinal, against the WM-seconds of 2019, a significant increase must be made in order to maintain the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German Werferin in Duell with the three-fold Olympian Denmark was backspace player Alina Grijseels with six gates.
"We were just not there - neither in the attack nor in the war," the backspace player Xenia Smits admitted and urged: "We have to look forward quickly."
Not on the height from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team with the tip was not at the height.
Errors and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a fast 0:4 backstand after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was at operating temperature immediately and prevented with some parades worse.
The first gate reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when greysel's fast opposition successfully completed.
However, the initial inflammation was not expected.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women, the German women could hardly put themselves in scene - and yet, mostly, they failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt at the Tor of the Scandinavia.
So at 3:10 after 20 minutes, the party had run early, especially Mia Zschocke, a little later, because of a hard foul on her counterplayer.
In the quarterfinal, however, it may re-operate.
Only in the final phase of the first half-time, the DHB selection came a little better in the game and until the break at least on five gates.
The only silent hope of a relief hunt after the change was already after seven minutes on 9:19.
Again, the greener protectors sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-established opponent who counts on the final round of the medal candidates.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to reach an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the Parkett.

The title is available, I am active as a vaccine in mobile vaccine teams in which the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon finished to a large part, then partly continues in vaccination centers for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are related to a personal person (e.g., "I take medicine X, this is complicated with vaccination.").
In my task area, the information for vaccination, the indication position (Person has the right to an vaccination according to Corona vaccine order and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if appropriate, emergency supply in allergic reactions (not yet happening).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, for example medical professionals.
In vaccine teams, however, we are often not involved, but “only” (for God’s sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, which cannot carry out vaccines (no need?), so that I also carry out most of the vaccines myself there.
Heavy "Huidler" Question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent by a Amberger, the BR TV broadcast "We in Bayern" has been given a strong thought.
However, the term in the series "Host Mi?" remained unresponsive this time by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "human who's nervous."
And no one, "that's all got to go fast."
That, the people heard from the TV moder, was totally wrong.
On what the man from Amberg announced the solution, and thereby probably also made a great deal of surprises in many upper pants.
"The Huidler," the audiences learned, "is a laptop with which someone removes the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, consulted by Bayerian television as expert for years, confirmed that.
With the note that this is a typical supraphal term, somehow derived from a more well-known word of the word "hors".
With which a educational gap was closed - probably also among some who have long lived in the Amberg room.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always comes: opens - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Deck selection at the race wheel, really so secure?
Today tomorrow, I was awakened with tanta because I wanted to train at least a little in the next week to prepare my bicycle tour.
Said, done, and I drive with my race wheel, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what happened in such every city (this time: Thank you, Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the route.
Zack, loud ziber and my backdrops wanted the rest of the route no longer to join.
Since I had no real opportunity to get my spare and replacement snake because of the week's day, I had to turn around with half a bad sound and take the first train home.
Then wasn't even so bad technically, maybe it's better if I practice this again before the bike tour with the tyre change.
But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days in front of me, I would be extremely unhappy to get this problem more often.
Now it wasn't really bad, since the old tires of the pre-owner (very nice old man, the day I came to pick up the bike up until 14 o'clock 120km!) and who had already referred to it as suboptimal because he had been in roll with them for years.
But if I think I have to make a tire change while driving after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really badly laughing :D
Now I came into conversation with an elderly man at the station, who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tyres; they should be unfit.
Now it sounds very enthusiastic, of course.
But are these really so incapable?
I have little desire to spend 40€/wheeves now, only to be disappointed then.
I continue to ask myself: I am currently on the race wheel I believe 25x622.
They are also (apparently?) at the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you like to recommend me to other tires at a race wheel?
The swallow side seems to be my absolute! Laie knowing rather to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and dear greetings!
Car slides against tree: drivers injured deadly
The 53-year-old was hoped on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unexplained reason against a middle island and then drove to the counterway, as the police announced.
There it came to a frontal collapse with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The car of the 53-year-old was then cast against a tree and the man climbed in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old accompanyer were severely injured and brought into surrounded hospitals in the accident.

After the publication of our new High End Breed Bands B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would also get back.
SOLO 15 is the new sprayer and optically reminds of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this suggestion, a suitable designed foot is included directly in order to raise the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This person has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in whom the maximum volume plays a more underlying role, but it sounds to be achieved an exceptional high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to create almost unfiltered such a large sound pressure level.
That does not mean, however, that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerably grown up and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was agreed to the SOLO 15 with a slightly high-tone rise.
This is commonly used in broadbands to optimize the excessively high frequency accumulation.
Exactly focused on the hearing site, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Easily rotated to outside, the high-tone range can be reduced and thus the sound image is warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and amazing precise.
The reference suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy that seeks the same.
Solo 15 complements not only our SOLO series, but expands it in matters of resolution capacity and accuracy.
As with all our building sets, it is initially recommended to think about the final optics of the speaker in order to plan the corresponding changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to furnish the housing, the reduction of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, since the furnier has another material.
After all plates were cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill a 8 mm hole into the soil plate at the appropriate place to be able to perform the cable without any problem later.
With the help of a upper freak, the loud speech opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used together later.
This reverse opening should be provided with a 45° fibre to make the opening area of the speaker chess in the inside as large as possible.
The four scrubbing points of the B 100 - 6 OHM will be interrupted in the phase, as shown in the image “Detail Fife”.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a level area in front of yourself.
The wall, cover, front and ground are now being trained on them.
The three pollutants should also be used and consumed.
The dusts themselves can vary in the material strength if necessary, for example, if you want to take back to finished performances from the construction market instead of manufacture them from 16 mm MDF itself.
The next step of work is the second page.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The application of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connecting brake on the rear wall, is facilitated by an appropriate hole circular or forest driller.
Afterwards, you use a roundfruit to round all edges of the real box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off.
The footplate is closed with the foot of the cabin and is also screwed with long wood screws.
It follows the drawing and pre-burning (2,5-mm borer) of the scrubbing points of the speaker chassis and the connector brackets.
After the housing of wooden dust was cleaned (sucking / blowing out), you start with the depletion of the cable.
The easiest way this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The whole and uncurrected cable is pushed piece for pieces through the 8 mm drilling into the foot until the terminal opening and makes it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the cabin, the cable leads to the opening of a sound speech and also makes it loose.
Hereafter the frequencies are prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequencies, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Montageanleitung Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequench is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the decoupling of the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet fully locked.
By the 35 mm BASSREFLEX opening and with something skill, you can drop heat plugs on the opening and so lock.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, you can check the density accordingly.
Now follow the contamination according to description.
Then the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and screwed with the appropriate screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus wire (marked cable) must be suspended at the Plus Pole of the speaker (greater contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is reduced and plugged in to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe).
To pollute a mat of dust material is cut into two parts and distributed looserly in the cabin.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up a order now and let it be delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to all,
> Finally, we can announce that we also organise the OSCAST this year again!
> We are unfortunately unable to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term notice.
ABER: At least three people will be there by switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Have some drinks cold, plan good food and make you ready for a long, but very interesting night.
