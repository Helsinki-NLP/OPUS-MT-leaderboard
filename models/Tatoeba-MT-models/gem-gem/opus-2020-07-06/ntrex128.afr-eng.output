Members of the Wallian Assembly are worried they're going to look like soft.
There is congestion among some members of the meeting on the proposal to change their title from AM'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from all over the political spectrum are afraid that it can lead to a ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because "that's rim with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means discharge.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "receptional" about the name change, but noted that it was a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of soft or foolish.
In this context, the Wallic letter w is expressed you like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter.
The Assembly Commission, currently designing legislation to set up the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what is called Assembly members will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Welsh meeting the power to change his name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received extensive support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As regards the AM'es title, the Commission Welsh Parliament preferred Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received most approval in a public consultation.
AM'e seemed to be presenting alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache to the Chairman, Elin Jones, who should present a legislative proposal on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes in the meeting's way of working, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last word in the question about what they should be called when they discuss the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the change of country’s name
Choosers will vote Sunday or their country's name must be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was arranged in an attempt to eliminate a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has itself a province called Macedonia.
Athens already urges for some time that the name of his neighbor in the north represents a claim in his area and has repeatedly taken capture against his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the national vote on the change of name, said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, suggest that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's get silent because churches in Harlem are struggling.
"Historically spoken," said the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church was on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Not one of the two is there today."
He says that the disappearance of cages is understandable.
"People socialize today in other ways," he said.
"Kroees are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people go regularly."
As regards churches, he is worried that the money from sales will not keep as long as leaders expect, "and earlier or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refugees.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore will bring the day that these churches completely close even closer, for most of the people who enter into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropool - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white methodist communities moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshiped nearby took over the building’s title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the direction of Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boicot of retailers in 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to set or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson’s members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carilion.
David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carilion "the poor people's bells".
The expert who played the cariljon in July called it something else: "A Culture treasure" and "a unreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilion in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger carilion at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been played at St. Martin's last few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lectors of the church, others by the Episcopal Bishop.
The church council, the congregation's control body, which consists of leaks - wrote to the bishop in July with concern that the bishop was "trying to convey the cost" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the bishop.
Some members of the congregation complain about a lack of transparency from the bishop's side.
Hay injured 13 - year - old on lobby in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured when he dived for lobby on the first day of the lobby season in California, said officials.
The attack took place shortly before 7:00 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and then robbed with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought it was just the excitement of a first lobby catch, but then he realized that he called, 'I was bite!
I'm bited!"
His whole key leg was broken open," Hammel saw when he came out to the boy.
"I cried that everyone should come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!' adds Hammel.
The boy was flying to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as criticism.
It is not known what shark species are responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media information session that a shark had been observed a few weeks ago in the area, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries on the top of his upper body.
Officers closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planned extension to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's says Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams the fight against department store-type beauty walks that were employed by specialist assistants.
As part of a large expansion in the UK’s £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home goods fall back, the larger beauty gates will be tested in 11 shops across the country and if it is a success to more shops next year.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets seek ways of filling rakes once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury’s says that it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which for the first time will include trade names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with trademark specific areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its Boutique-grimming series so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something that more and more young buyers demand.
In addition, the parfum small trader, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, of which the first week opened in Croydon in South London and a second that will later open in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller quantities of food that are purchased every day at local comfort shops means that supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the shops are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against the sales shops Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's placed Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and also announced a number of Habitat sales points since it bought two years back both these chains, which, according to their sales of her herbal sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint company with Boots in early 2000's, but the ratio was terminated after a argument about how the profit should be divided from the pharmaceuticals within its shops.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 shop pharmacy for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering a comprehensive series of luxurious skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said, "We have transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty courses to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at hand to provide advice.
Our series of trade names are designed to satisfy every need and the attractive environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a territorial beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones' raging' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones ran away 'wadering' after the TV provider Holly Willoughby withdraws her from an £11 million agreement with his lifestyle trademark business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their dresses and attendance trade name, Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name.
The This Morning Provider, 37, announced at Instagram that she was withdrawing herself.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-star Peter Jones angry by at the last moment withdrawing their profitable lifestyle trademark business--to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "wrong" when TV's gold girl Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - which is worth up to £1.5 million - meant that she can't spend enough time to their home clothes and attendance trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop trade name and would have doubled, according to Willoughby’s estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she left Truly, Jones climbed on a beam and exchanged Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says, "Truly was Holly's greatest priority on distances.
It would be her long - term future that would bear her through the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her has totally stumbled all the involved.
No one could believe Tuesday what was happening, it was so close to the announcement.
There's a storehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that's right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain's stars that bring in most money, the company can hunt millions out of the bag due to the huge investment in products that range from kissings and candles to clergy and home clothing, and the possibility that its announcement can encounter even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples have a vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business."
Hard words 'and then we get in love'
He ridiculed about criticism that he was going to get from the news media because he had made a comment that some would view as "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his chamber, "new reader voice."
"I didn't give up."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step to the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have burned.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday, more than three months after the June Leader Assembly in Singapore, to leaders at the United Nations General Assembly that the North do not see a "consistent reaction" from the U.S. on North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanks aimed at keeping the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic impression in his convention talk.
"Our progress is excellent with North Korea," he said."
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim resulted in positive results - it ended firepilot tests, helped to free hostages, and caused the rest of American soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to come in 'this stampful arena, we would have had nearly 200 people just standing there," Trump said while he pointed to the crowd right before him.
Crown and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, hundreds died
For example, in the afterlihood of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population have been demolished, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite to catalyze international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they didn't ask international help, which makes it a little difficult," said I. Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials evaluate the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance effort.
Given the earthshade that Indonesia continues to endure, the country is sadly poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunami shoes were built in Aceh, it is not a common face to other coastal lines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning iron in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning of power.
It is at its best challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia's luminous infrastructure a core point of his election campaign and spent violent money on roads and railroads.
However, Mr. Joko’s administration is tempted by financial shortages as he stares on reselecting next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of suspending sectaric stress in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of unthems like Christian and Muslim bands with capmesses, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premierliga loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri announced Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of the Chelsea target and his team 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before he kicked far to the target stake.
The effort seized high over the frame as it swept to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball bubbled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just to try to come in that position, to come on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible for myself," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edges come and type one time and don't think too much about it and just kick."
By half time, Chelsea was 1-0 before the Belgian star Eden Hazard signed a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' target head in that play area with a back-up again played to Mateo Kovacic before he was twelve near the middle field and had engineering in the Liverpool helmet.
Kovacic quickly received and quoted in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward-head he then brought in the frame for Hazard.
Hazard passed the defense and ended with a left foot-scope past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farest target network.
Liverpool runs the battle against Napoli on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Napels, Italy.
Chelsea arrives Thursday at 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europe League in front of Videoton.
Death rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death count in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed up to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped under the waste of buildings that had caused the earthquake, which had hit on Friday at a range of 7.5, and caused burners from up to 20 feet, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 3,800,000 people, was consumed with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrests husband, 32, suspicious of murder after a woman was put to death
A murder investigation was sent up after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 p.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knifes, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police encouraged people in the area that had heard or seen anything to come forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation was in a early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the surroundings of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to any one, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on the dashcam film material, to contact us because they can have information that can be essential for our examination."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found within a property.
This afternoon, friends who believed to know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Studies are continued because the police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s neighbors.
A taxi manager who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Inhabitants are now said that it will take hours before they are returned.
It was heard that a police officer told one man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said 'It's so horrible.'

A number of officials have been left within the cordone to monitor the block apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to link @MerPolCC to DM, 101 or to link Crimestopers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes the latest memorandum with 'rewriting history'-twist
His banishment will be poetic justice for his Talibanlike destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "soothness" and "a attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Association, said, "It was inevitably in the present debate on the removal of statutes that the form of Oliver Cromwell would be a target outside the Palace of Westminster.
The sculpture storm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's manic picture of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century's opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believes are still worthy of memorial.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate picture, the subject of continued historical debate.
What is clear that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century gave shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognized figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a Protective is also worth celebration and Memorial."
Mörder Swine Screw Chinese Boer
A farmer, according to local media reports, was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by its of, "Yuan," was found with a cutter with blood covered death near a hook at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
A pig farmer prepared on May 30, 2005 to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled on Wednesday with his cousin from the neighbouring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pighok open.
He said there was a great male pig in the hook with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pond pig had bited the farmer to death.
"My cousin's legs were bleeded and screwed," said the cousin, who was called on the side of, "Wu," quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed its pigs.
His body was found some an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager said to the Evening New that the pig was closed to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities claim to negotiate reimbursement for his death.
Though weird, cases of pigs attacking people have been reported earlier.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pound-svink caught a Wales farmer against his tractor until his wife had scared off the beast.
After a farmer of Oregon was frozen by his pigs in 2012, a farmer of Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "sneller".
"They're not playing.
They're pics, very curious... they're not looking to hurt you.
You should only show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Res from Orkaan Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwest U.S.
As foretold, Orkaan Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring rains across northern Mexico and the southwest US over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 m.h., a category 1-orcaan, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trawl over the Pacific begins to form and move eastwards to the western coast of the US. Like Rosa Monday, the Baja California peninsula approaches as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity northwest of the southwest U.S.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity will, in response to the nearing trawl over the coming days, bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous tight floods, waste flows, and possibly soils in the wilderness.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause the place of rainfall from up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
The widespread nature of tropical rain may have rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It would be extremely unwise to wander into the wilderness with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep - clowns to touch desolate rivers and bring thunderstorms to heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The nearing trog will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainvaltotal numbers of more than half inches are possible, which can cause small waste flows and smooth rides.
It will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
Some spreading tropical rains will begin to draw closer to Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before rain is late Monday and Tuesday more widespread.
Heavy rain will spread on Tuesday to the Four Corners and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature flushing across the US as what the North Pole gets cooler, but the troops remain very warm.
It sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences throughout the central US is Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, magnificent summer warmth will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern U.S. October will begin warm, with widespread 80’s from the southern plain to in parts of the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher chance of bowling average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people look at Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday six television networks at the thrilling testimony of High Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that was supposed to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political death point continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday's up-the-three-tracking: an agreement made by Arizona-senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week's investigation.
Ford told the Senate-Justice Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to pull her clothes out at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he's 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people looked at it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewer numbers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to meet people who look at offices.
To put it in perspective, it's a hearing as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose advocates had strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, all the networks were before an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
Interest was still high after the trial.
Flakes were the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was caught on Friday morning at CNN and CBS- where objectors cried on him when he tried to take an elevator to a judicial committee.
He stood a few minutes with defeated eyes while CNN lively impressing how he was being badly said.
"I stand right here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the country the truth?
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and went to the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say to the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all living hours later when the Legal Committee would vote around Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would do it only with the mind that the FBI would look at the accusations against the candidate for the next week, as the Democratic minority requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump initiated an FBI investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of 'political game' about Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, of "political playing" with Britain's future and the undermining of national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times career.
Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May arrives on September 29, 2018 for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview along the one with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a proposal that Britain and the EU should introduce each other's tariffs was "total ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrests suspected Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second-grade murder, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officers issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the trunk.
The police found the glass on the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, reports CBS-affilified WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His deposit was established at $350,000, reported the lawyer.
The judicial body viewing office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday that says that the cause of death was a gun shot on the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's refugee task force, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, Southern University Police, and local citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic Director Joe Alleva thanks for the application of the territory law for his "enthusiasm and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-seven predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average past season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per race.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball trainer Will Wade said the team in "plated" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"This is what you are constantly worried about," said Wayde.
Vulcan Sprayed As in Mexico City
As spiting from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital reached.
The National Center for Ramp Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity had picked up in the crater and recorded over 24 hours 183 releases from gas and ashes.
The center monitored multiple drones and shakings.
Pictures on social media showed how thin low gas covers motor winds near Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophistics have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 miles) southeast of the capital since a earthquake with a range of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflicts with Catalonian Separators before Memorial of Independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona Saturday after pro-independence demonstrators were inflicted with unlust politics, and thousands joined in contradictions to commemorate the first Memorial of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for defeatment.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were retained by unlust politics, boiled them with eggs and threw powder painting that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually weave from tourists.
Also, later in the day, a bully broke out, and the police had to use their knuppels to keep the fighting in toom.
In several hours pro-independence groups on one tone, "No forgot, no forgiveness" sang in confrontation with the unionists' cry from "Lank Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for small injuries in the processions, reported the local press.
The stress continues to run high in the independence-like region a year after the referendum of 1 October by Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatis-Katalan.
Choiceers voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against defeat that largely bouched the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried in violent conflicts to prevent the voting at the voices throughout the region.
Pro-undependency groups camped over Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electric attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he is no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia will gain independence.
"Last year we had been through one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying of joy because they could vote but now stuck us," he said.
Despite a vital but nail scrape victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their most famous leaders or in self-deployed exile or in arrest for their role in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took up the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, says the conflict was inspired by politicians on both sides.
"It becomes increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalonian leaders in pre-reasoning since late last year, announced that he was going to be in European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for European elections is the best way to reject the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.

Menga target gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s First Purpose for Livingston Assures Victory
Advanced Livigston surprised Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 competitions as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s purpose proved the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to second.
Gerrard's team stayed this season in the Premiership without a vacation and came to stand next week before the ancestors of Heart, which are their eight points.
Rankers are first Thursday host for Rapid Vienna in the European Liga.
In the meantime, Livingston expands their unavailable gap in the division to six competitions, with chief coach Holt who has still not tasted a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston Plays Chances of bot Visitors
Holt's team must have run ahead long before they signed a target, with their round breasts that Rangers had put all kinds of problems on the neck.
SR broke through, but drew before the target hook, then AL could only play wide after he had approached and met CH’s heads on the other side of the target hook.
The hosts were pleased to make Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could get the visitors with dead gamblings.
And thus the decisive purpose came.
Rangers lost a freeze, and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to shove and sign a goal from the middle of the frame.
By that time, Rangers had dominated but could not push through home defense, and target guard Liam Kelly was largely unaware.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos had forced Kelly to reverse.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by the feet of Rangers Target Guard Allan McGregor, and Lithgow typed wide to escape the open game of Livingston.
Crossers repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly stopped, while two penalties — after Halkett’s challenge of replacer Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were dismissed.
‘Phenomenal’ of Livingston — Analysis
BBC Scotland’s Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal games and results for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they still exceed expectations on this upward course.
Their style of game and crew has been almost unchanged since their return to first order, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was gigantic with his manic defense arrangement while Menga for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on their toes.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
As well as at times under Gerrard, they could not maintain those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they could push through the home team, which was somewhat of a queue for Rangers, which they were in middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Köln
There was Saturday (September 29) smiling and blue air when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO councils.
They had an outfall on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkish tournament to the EU.
Erdogan was then Köln to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted certainty reasons to prevent the 25,000-star crowd from gathering before the mosque, but many supporters arrived thereafter to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of their Kurdish – also made their voices thick and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The struggling demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor greeted by some German Turks as a hero and claimed by others as an autocratic.
Deptford path accident: Bike rider dies in conflict with motor
A cyclist died in a collapse in London involving a car.
The conflict took place around 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy path in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died on the scene.
The collapse comes months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-trap in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials work on identifying the man and knowing his neighbors.
Trail shuttles and bus routes were recommended in place, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guardians in injuries
Six guards were injured in a rebellion at a high-security men's prisoner, said the prison office.
Oproer broke out on Sunday around 09:30 BST and continues at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado guards" was invited to handle the rebellion, which includes eight prisoners and is limited to one wings.
The guards were treated on the scene for small facial injury.
A prison service advocate said: "Specially trained prison staff have been exploded to pay attention to a continued inspector at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind trails longer."
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous transgressors.
In June, it was reported that the chief of the prison had received hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, distress officers were invited to pay attention to serious disorders in which staff were attacked with billions of balls.
Orkaan Rosa Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With tight floods (Droogte zones Trek Dalk Benefits)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure strikes Arizona but it's exactly what can happen early next week if Orkaan Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwest desert and brings high-flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued fast - flood watches for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and by Monday will approach with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noticed in a whit that only "ten tropical cycles since 1950 have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was an orkan within 40 miles from the AZ border."
The National Orcan Center’s models foretell 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated quantities of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the Southwest American, including the Central Rockies and the Great Com, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated total from possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside the high - flood risk, Rosa’s rain will probably be a blessing since the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall will probably be beneficial since the Southwest currently experiences drought conditions.
According to the US Drying Monitor, only over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second highest category," reported weather.com.
First, Orkaan Rosa’s road leads to approaching land across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at orcanic strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm opposes cooler water in the Pacific, so her power decreases.
So it is expected that in the afternoon or evening she will reach the land against tropical storms in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Regnvaltotals from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," reported Weather.com.
Rosa will then move north as a tropical storm over Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border in early morning hours as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and southern Utah at late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger that Rosa is expected is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the Southwest," said the National Orcan Center.
It is expected that this rain can cause life - threatening floods and ruin flows in the deserts and ground shifts in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempts to kill
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested in suspicion of attempting to kill after a 16-year-old with sticks in Somerset was found.
The injured teenager son was found Saturday at about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he is still in a "static" state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested in the Radstock area overnight, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officers have appealed to anyone who may have any mobile image of what happened to come to the front.
Trump says Kavanaugh that ' suffered under the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party.
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the graceless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had suffered under the community, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed to the Congress on Thursday and denied a claim from Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her claim during the trial.
The President said Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"'A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skilled legal spirits of our time, a jurisdiction with a pure record of public service," he said to the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirect referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke of the importance of Republican rise at the mid-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I don't stand, but actually I stand," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission to "resist and hinder."
The first important procedural voice on the Senate floor about Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, a senior GOP leader said to CNN.
Hundreds of death due to Indonesian shattering, tsunami, with figures still rising
At least 384 people were dead and many were washed away when giant waves broke on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the city of Palu on the beach on Friday for a festival on the beach when burners broke up to six feet (18 feet) high at sunset on the beach, swallowed many away after their death, and destroyed all that was in the road.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-range earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat began yesterday, people were still busy in their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of Indonesia's disaster lighting agency BBB during a information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it drew cars, stomps, houses, it hit everything on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved over the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were dismantled to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops that were destroyed, bridges that were confused and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
After shocks still shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes is felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) stated in a declaration that the energy released by Friday’s giant scatter was about 200 times the force of the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the point of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels collapsed.
He said that bodies of some victims were found where they were trapped under the ruins of buildings that collapsed, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the accidents and damage could be larger along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a area called Donggala, closer to the earthquake shark.
Communication "is completely impaired with no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized Saturday because they had not told that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had come when the warning was issued.
In amateur image material divided on social media, can be heard how a man on the top floor of a building desperate warnings about the coming tsunami cries to the people below the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and slides buildings and cars.
Reuters were unable to promptly declare the image material authentic.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power breaks that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending truck flights with the help of Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but evacuated people still need foods and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo would visit decommissioning centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-tsunami mortality rates rise above 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, where workers in deck seal hidings established in their office's courtyard, they passed on the way to scenes of destruction, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me that they had seen many houses that were destroyed," he said.
This is very bad.
Even while assisting groups start with the horrible task of launching the disaster lighting task, some people complained that foreign assistance workers were prevented from traveling to Palu with great experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, stocks, and staff from overseas can be launched only after the area of the disaster has been declared to national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at province level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Good, it is a national disaster," we can open it for international assistance, but it has not yet a status."
At the arrival of the second night on Palu to Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who are still missing hopefully that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was taken out of a rinse pipe.
Sunday rescue workers had saved a woman for two days under ruin was tied with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the trainer of the Indonesian national valve team, disposed of two of the missing fallscreens for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Monday, were his students.
"As a senior in the fallscreen sweaving field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon tells us how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media under the fallscreensweb society, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach celebration.
His messages, however, were only answered with one grey right mark, instead of two blue right marks.
"I think it means the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26.750 during refill from OTM by Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole on Friday morning $26.750 at a Brink's worker who refilled a OTM at Newport on the Livee, according to a news statement of the Newport Police Station.
The car's driver was cleaning a OTM in an entertainment complex and ready to deliver more money, detector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press statement.
While he was busy, another man came down behind the Brink's employer and stole the bag money that was to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspicions flying from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the inside.
Anyone with information about their identity must contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Faster changes his name to Ye
Faster Kanye West will change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, had for a while the nickname Ye and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change occurs before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected that he will announce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that canceled for "emotional reasons", said the program's manufacturer.
Besides being a abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'ye'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with the radio provider Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love this year.
A former Western co-worker, JAY-Z, has already done with or without a link sign and uppercase letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military forces against civilians
Mexican newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised the country's 50th Memorial of a bloody reimbursement against students never to use military power against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to "never use the army to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot on October 2, 1968 on a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where up to 300 people were killed in a time when left-sized student movements posted throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who were studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities move youth to gangs.
U.S. should double CIA funding
With China who becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount spent on research in this field, invester and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the US government made CI announcements, even shortly the US a complete formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced their plan last year: they seemed to be the No. 1 in KI innovation by 2030.
"Double the KI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in KI," said Lee.
The double of funding can double the chance that the next big KI performance will be achieved in the US, Lee said in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published in this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, was the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent KI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a KI system that knocked the highest coarse American Othello player, and later he was a managing officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has acknowledged previous technology competitions from the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one will be to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S.A. often have to work hard to win government seats, said Lee.
"It is not China that takes the academic leaders away; it is the corporative," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have in recent years appointed influential persons from other universities to work on CI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help help the U.S. KI efforts.
"I think green cards must be automatically offered to PhD's in CI," he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council issued their Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence set up a joint center for artificial intelligence that aimed at entering vennotes from industry and the academic world and the Withuis announced the formation of a council on artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it is currently investing over $100 million a year in KI research.
Meanwhile, US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence last month came under fire.
Macedonians vote in election or country’s name must change
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether their name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", action that would solve a decade-old dispuut with Greece which blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, who has a province called Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbours' name represents a demand in the area and refused their authorisation to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he wouldn't vote in the referendum and a bocot campaign saw doubts about whether the arrival would meet the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum voting letter read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev claimed that it was a price that could be paid to pursue the authorisation for Macedonia, one of the countries that came from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they could live free under the paraply of the European Union, because it means more safe lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough parliamentary members said that they would accept the outcome of the vote to decide.
The change of name will require a second-secondity in Parliament.
The State’s election Commission said there were no reports of inclusions by noon.
But the rise was then only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko bring out their voices for the referendum in Macedonia about the change of the country’s name that will set the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Srumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small hike and drawn chairs before tents set up by those who go to the referendum boicot.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join our heads up, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will bring very necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he had brought out his voice.
He said "yes" would be "confirmation of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research stated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum — less than the required amount.
Another survey, performed by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the rise must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A relapse in the referendum will be the first serious relapse for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through the whole Brighton Defense for Purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton Defense in Manchester City's 2-0 won on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously easy in his purpose in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentinian target head received an adjacent at the middle field.
He chased between three Brighton defenders by the door before he hit the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed by one defender before he passed several others on the edge of the Brighton target hook.
He then pushed a pine to the left, where he found for Sterling.
The English predictor used his first touch in the hook to send the ball back to Aguero, which used his right foot to knock the Brighton target guard Mathew Ryan with a shove to the right side of the net.
"Aguero struggles with his feet," said City Manager Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We're happy that he signed a purpose at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga fighting.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
On that game, Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few contacts before he led Sterling to the farest target angle.
The Sky Blues foretold the ball kicked in the net just before he was over the back line.
City takel Hoffenheim in Campioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play corruption against Rockies
With the Nationals that are out of the playback game, there is not much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to attack the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but just if there are still play-ups for the Rockies, which have a single match-precistence above the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies at least got a promotional choice with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday evening, but still wants to capture their first division title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point of me will stare in sight this year.
Why would I not want to participate?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but it is reported to be favorable to make Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will begin his 34th, had a throw-training session on Thursday, and will play on his normal rest-day.
The Washington right handy is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outlets in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
Indirectly, the president referred to the situation surrounding his High Court Selection Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of Republican arrival at the mid - term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
It's one of the big, big – I don't stand, but I really stand, and that's why I fight for these candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, one sees it happen now.
And now they are determined to take the power back by using any possible way, one sees the commonness, the genius.
They don't care whosoever they hurt, who they shall walk over to gain power and control, this is what they want, power and power, we shall not give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And a man sees it over the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "inflicted and foolish and false."
He referred on the name to Senate’s judicial committee’s high - positioned Dianne Feinstein, who had received hard bows from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you let the document leak?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Worker party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to put me under sensation, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I'm the last person in a string Workersparty LPs who was told we weren't welcome – all because we said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she was fearlessly opposed to anti-semitism.
In my case, the sparrow of sensation criticized me because I differed from Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically enough similar issues that Jeremy differed from former leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Worker party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Worker Party LP, it was exactly what Vrydagaande's AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, it is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of "friendlyer, more kind" politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views, began to expect of me to make an U turn and take positions that I would never otherwise agree with – whether about national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and that doesn't really matter what I say – there's a tiger of skeletal on social media that asks me not to be reselected, disappointed politics from the core, and to tell me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And that is not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments on me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination to those colleagues who every day stare a flood of sexistic or racist insults, but never shattered away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of mistrust" or change of selection rules the party becomes more intense.
I have had many advice in the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so pronounced and that I will then be "nick".
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it the most – whether as a local council member or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who promoted the moss on Friday, I can only say that with the country that sends on a Brexit that is going to harm all households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Labour Party.
But the only message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, whether they are now members of the Labour Party, I am proud of serving you, and I promise that no amount of threats of being reselected or political advantage will prevent me from doing what I believe in all of you's best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unavailable Ayr Bo
Two late threes may have pulled the final outcome somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to victory in this wonderful-pretty Tennent's Premiership competition of the day.
They are now at the top of the score, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, who wore the home team, and trainer Peter Murchie had all the right to be satisfied.
"We have so far been tested in our competitions and we are still unconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Dear to Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, which was intended by Frazier Climo, made Ayr to be ahead, but a yellow map for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the competition by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot signed an unmemberd three.
Climo increased Ayr's precursor with a criminal head, just before he, just before resting, aimed a solodry to make it rest time 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, targeted by Baggot, reduced the backstand to five points.
There was a long suspension for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott that was carried on a portable, and from the restart Ayr increased the precursor with a Stafford McDowall-three, intended by Climo.
Ayr's observing captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and Melrose used the extra player with an unwanted three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a lot of printing game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson had got a yellow card because he had killed for Climo without the ball, and from the criminal line stand MacPherson had pushed the ball dead behind the coming Ayr-losmahl.
Climo purposed it, necessarily he had done almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong had got the target head and flank Gregor Henry had sent away for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star looks like he's going to deal with a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game star seems to be going to move to the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in with old comedievennnoot Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next nineth season would be the last of the program, and Kiernan seems to be ready for life to Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment, although a source of the Scotish Sun suggested that Kiernan would be involved in Glasgow's "floating restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': country-rounded Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific Ocean
Matrose patrols a mass-worked fleet quarts in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea blue flag.
Fleet bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are dressed with the slogan: "The sea is to our rights.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the land - surrounded Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh — the need to travel again to the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is probably the highest that it was in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a judgment by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after 5 years of discussion.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peacefulness, and of course expects the result with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH pronunciation on large screens throughout the country, in the hope that the Tribunal in the Hague will find itself in favour of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president — who next year stares a controversial struggle for reselecting — also has many dependent on Monday’s statement.
"We're close to returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analists believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor — and that few will change if it would.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to acknowledge Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's decision comes only six months after the last point shows that the matter was "not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than helping Bolivia’s matter, the past four years may have delayed it.
"The issue of access to the sea was captured by the present Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Moralism’s aggressive retoric tapped any remaining Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue again at a time, but it will be extremely difficult to conduct naded conversations.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in Den Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile" and an opportunity to put an end to 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the maritime question as a political crown.
Bolivia will never give up his right to access to the Pacific," he added.
"The pronunciation is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless their U.S. can trust.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never be able to disarm their nuclear weapons first if they couldn't trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He appealed to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a meeting in Singapore between the competition leaders.
His comments follow to U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo apparently is on the edge to restart nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead point, more than three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a dream image that continued sanks and U.S. caption will also bring the North on its knees to a declaration that ended the Korean War.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang’s first taking significant steps to disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second consultant.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about making a arsenal distance that the country considers as the only way to guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest series of large main covers on the way to the shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely turn off the sun, you don’t need to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne announced a series of lawns overwhelming head covers at their SS19 collection on the walking plank that entrusted the style at Paris Modeweek.
Ultimately unpractical hats stretched through this summer Instagram, and these designers paraded their marvelous creations on the walking plank.
The exquisite by Valentino was a huge beige hat with a featherlike wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other excessive additions included waatlemons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat, and even a pain apple – but it was not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also announced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had worked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute coutures.
One creation looked like a scuba equipment, including a snorkel and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice horn.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Stylists foretell that the huge hat may be on the way to the shops near you.
The great hats follow shortly on the hooks of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two feet wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractical hat spread over socials, sent another great creation over the walking plank – a straw beach bag that was nearly as large as the swimming dressed model that drew it.
The burned orange raffiasak, processed with raffinate fractions and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Known silence Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in shops next summer – since the designer made such a great impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessive additional.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a rice performances of academic excellence, and it was continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exams, which was only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music, and other community companies.
With more than 30,000 schoolers throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their schoolers and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their schoolers for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable field selection in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we can not only rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are above the liga tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of schoolers who studied strange languages have achieved a higher degree A.
The data, collected from SCIS 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent students had achieved a higher degree A in Mandarines, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also got an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young adults will no doubt need in the future.
Languages now have the same view as the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the United Kingdom Committee on Professional Affairs and Skills in 2014 found that some of the reasons that workers provide for their difficulty in filling posts are 17 percent attributed to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills become increasingly important to prepare young people for their future courses.
With more likely jobs that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career anyone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically put above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a strange language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is so important to invest in today’s children’s language education.
Knowing various languages, especially those of developing economies, will make children equipped with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages that are considered essential to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from independence schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools have been dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equippe children with the skills needed to achieve success, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be detected at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, so it must be reflected in education.
True, modern languages really have to be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
Il runs bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scotland Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make Sunday debut for San Diego Lakers
The guard is almost over for followers to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers-trainer Luke Walton announced that in Sunday's pre-season-opening competition against the Denver Nuggets, James will play in San Diego.
But precisely how many minutes he is going to play has to be determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell whispered that James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercising earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six competitions in the pre-season programme.
"I don't need at this stage in my career for-season competitions to get ready," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Assembly Time, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening a flat election meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump’s first of five planned companions in the next week, including stops in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation voice currently retained for his choice to fill the vacations in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the coming intermediate election because the Republicans are at risk of losing control over the Congress when voted in November.
How late is Trump's pulling together in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's assemblies in Wheeling, West Virginia, were planned for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can look at Trump’s joining in West Virginia via living streaming below.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings to the appointed Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense about accusations of sexual misconduct with an anticipated confirmation voice that was retained for a week while the FBI investigated.
However, the main point of this excess is to help the Republicans face difficult elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign said that in the next week these five gatherings were aimed at visiting " volunteers and supporters while Republicans tried to protect and expand the majority they had in the Senate and the House of Reuters," according to Reuters.
"Management of the Congress is so critical for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused his name to be called, to Reuters.
Tonight's gathering, arranged for the Wesbanco-Arena in Wheeling, supporters can draw from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Western Virginian candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, which is behind according to the voice patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a hupshot at the voice bus," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryderbeker 2018: The team of the U.S. shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep the hope alive when they enter Sunday’s single game
After three unilateral sessions, the four gambling teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Rider Beaker needed.
The swinging sling of momentum is an altogether defined sport concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and definitely in competitions like that.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went forward with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum, I count," said Jordan Spieth when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points before, and twelve more played.
The Americans, however, feel, as Spieth says, that they have so little wind in their sails and that there are many to encourage them, not at least not the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and signed each three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the base to the cleanfield and led through his example.
That scorn of celebrations became harder as she progressed rounds and he sank a critical sethou to win four completely equally while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two behind.
His set hold that won the race on 15 for them was greeted with a similar cry, the kind that tells a man that he believes that the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to pick up everything and worry about your own competition," said Spieth.
That is all that those players have left.
18 wells to print their stamp.
The only players who have more points over the past two days than Spieth and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unambiguous story of the Ryderbeker.
Europe’s unparent but charming couple got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only few who didn't keep one registered on Saturday afternoon, but they also held one on Saturday morning about the number of the trains and during the rear of the nine Friday morning.
That gap, and the way their energy appears to flow to and from this excessive crowd, confirm that they are the players who have to be cloped Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari that can climb a potential European victory when the sun over Le Golf National sacks.
Choose both simultaneously or at different wells.
However, it is too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short metes with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four - ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One holds over the number of tracks and two doubles on the front of the nine, the Spanish and the Swedish landed into a hole that they couldn't even come out of.
Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four balls and four gambling teams are so exciting to watch from close because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change to a moment.
Until now, Europe has always played better as a team and on the last day has taken significant lead, but this four-game session also showed that the team of the U.S. team had the courage for the struggle some doubted, especially at home.
Europe runs 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Ryder-Beker
On the last day of the Ryder-Beker, Europe will have a healthy advantage after they have come with a front of 10-6 from Saturday's fourball and four games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a difficult Tiger Woods to take their score as far as Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tried to maintain the trophy that lost them at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that unevenly practised in the morning's four balls, so they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. hosted more resistance in the four games and won two competitions, but they did not shrink the disadvantage.
Jim Furik’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single game games to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European new man who won four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, were just the second few in the history of the Ryderbeker who signed four points after their first four races.
After they broke Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they played excellent together to conquer a pape Woods and American new man Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who drew himself on Saturday through two races, sometimes showed flashes of brilliantness, but now he lost 19 of his 29 races in fourballs and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 lower layer for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - which is first and third on the world ranking list.
On a pleasant day, however, Europe did not always get their senses with a little southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth who won three times a big tournament and Justin Thomas put the mark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
They signed a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to knock Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four games after they lost the first two wells.
Just twice in the history of the Ryder-beker, a team restored a backstand of four points when they enter the single game, although Furik's team just needs to play equally to maintain the trophy because they already hold it.
But after they have been the second best for two days, they do not seem to be able to do a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will 'do not' disarmed unanimously without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday to the United Nations that continuing sanks would increase their mistrust from the United States and that the country would certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho said to the World Body's annual General Assembly that in the past year North Korea had taken "substantive welwilling measures", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test site and promiseing not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We see, however, no corresponding response from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will certainly not disarm ourselves unanimously first."
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "fashioned" approach to removal of nuclear weapons that would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his words seemed meaningful by not rejecting unilateral removal of nuclear weapons unconditionally as Pjong had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint declaration issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first top meeting between a president of the U.S. and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim was working for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to have a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said that Piongyng must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to suspend strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of the sanctions to achieve their goal in a compulsory way, and even objecting to the 'declaration of the end of the war'," said Ri.
"The perseque that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions make our mistrust worse."
Ri said nothing about plans for a second top meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader had pointed to the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party in this issue was about the destruction of nuclear weapons South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead point."
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN's General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's fire arrows will be directed to the U.S. country mass after "Mr. Bosnian President" Trump called for Kim a "fire pillman" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to destroy North Korea, commended Kim abundantly for his courage because he had taken steps to disarm, but he said that much work had to be done and that sanctions still have to stay there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeframe for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the United Nations Security Council must reward Pongyang for the steps they have taken.
But, the U.S. Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: "The application of sanctions by the Security Council must continue zealously and without stop until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to dry up funding for Pjongyng’s nuclear and ballistic mission programmes.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterwards said that he would visit Pionageng again next month to prepare for a second top meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Piongyng in July and said that progress was made, but North Korea accused him only hours later that he had put "boundlike demands".
At a meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to break a missile portal and also make a nuclear complex if the United States "consistent measures".
He said that Kim told him that the "consistent measures" he wants to see are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalisation of relationship with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course over enough rest
A new course at the Harvard University this year makes all his advanced students sleep more in an effort to oppose the growing macho culture of study by coffin-driven 'healday sessions'.
A academic has found that students at the world’s top university are often unintentional when it comes to the basic principles of how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at the Brigham and Women Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after he had spoken about the effect of sleep loss on learning.
At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had yet told her how important sleep was--what surprised me," he said to The Telegraph.
The course, offered for the first time that year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their general welfare.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after it was found that students had been seriously taken sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a sleeping room, where students on coffee cups, gardins, exercise shoes and books must click to be told about the effects of coffee and light and how athletics are influenced by sleeping defects and the importance of a sleeping time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long - term sleeping can increase risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the champion, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
'We know that will not change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know what the health effect is of choosing cigarettes," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride to study 'all day' still exists, he said, and added that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students meant that sleep loss is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'holy weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid having weight, because sleep loss of the brain is placed in a starving mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after his first year at Harvard, one of his classes.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to work him for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before they join the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effect of 'blue light' that is radiated by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disturb your circadian rhythm and can cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Purpose of Menga conquer Gerrard’s men
Rangers experienced another sarsie away heartache when Dolly Menga's target head Steven Gerrard's incompatible team brought down 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February's 4-1-sea at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only gave to Gerrard his second defeat in 18 competitions as a driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which had run loosely in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before resting, and it didn't seem a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
While Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on target difference.
And there can be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object appears to have been thrown off the way.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr after the end struggle of the Betfred-Beker.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point of Heart last week, and he would have been in his pleasant with the way his well practiced team slaughtered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated balbesit, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
Actually, after just two minutes, they had to sign in when Menga’s first delegate Scott Pittman passed on to Allan McGregor’s goal, but the middle field player opened his great chance.
A deep freeze by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only miss shoving at the rear end.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he must have got a criminal goal at the quarterly point when he and Steven Lawless conflicted, but the divorce judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was hardly hurt by Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a mak target of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opening maker may have been at the 34th minute in the direction of game, no one can deny that they earned it, even if it is only hard for their hard work.
Rangers again did not handle a deep piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and sent it to Menga for a simple round.
Gerrard acted at the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had a almost immediate impact when the wings sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly jaged from his line to the block.
However, Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the type of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett that paved in long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased their lead in the last stages, but McGregor was well up to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could come far from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a penalty head when he got through with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sonday morning" almanak: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and OUR TEL VERDER ... the day the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geigerteller.
Since then the Geigerteller has been a supportpilar of science, and it has also become a supportpilar in popculture, like in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which these two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man, "What on Earth is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you can even hear the effect of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Good, it cracks about!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that wears his name is alive.
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune system to 'see' robber cells
New cancer vaccines can learn the immune system to 'see' and kill robbery cells
Inflammation teaches immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can then see a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify robber cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, the change of them in the laboratory so that they can see a protein that appears in many cancers and is called HER2, and then to inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drivs the growth of several types of cancer," including breast-, ovarian, lung- and color cancer, explained professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and to 'lear' how to attack cancer cells worked to hit a type of leukemia.
Kanye West began after his action on SNL with a pro-Trump ridicule, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was emitted during a Saturday Night Live in the studio after an exercised action in which he believed the U.S. president Donald Trump and said he would be preferable in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town and when he wore a Make America Great-pet, he went out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
"I speak so often to a white man and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's judicial committee on accusations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not seen, the images of West’s scaling were loaded by the comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It was unclear whether Rock tried to ridicule West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it had been difficult for him behind the stage about what he had worn on his head.
"They knocked me behind the stage.
They said, 'I'll go out with that hat.'
They knocked me!
And then they say I am in a low place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, "Would you see the low place?" and said that he would dress his "supermantle, because it means that you can't tell me what I should do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comment was at least twice exhibited to the audience and members of the SNL role distribution seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there who said to the publication, "The whole athlete has become dead silent."
West was brought in as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rhymcletser Mac Miller died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with an execution of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the Covering Group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who whispered: "On one of the most courageous spirits: DANKIE WITH YOU WORK TO THE CARLE."
But chattop-programgas woman Karen Hunter bet that West was just "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose to pay someone NOT (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "kunst") that I believe I accept and preach that threatens my community.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rhythm clamper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the being known earlier as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist who changed his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion, and, of course, widely musical legendary Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones-star Kit Harington criticizes toxic mality
Kit Harington is known for his sword - violent role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they should be tough to be respected.
Kit talked to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic mality in the #MeToo-era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, acknowledged that he felt 'reasonably strong' about making some of this issue work.
'I personally feel quite strong about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with maleness?' he said.
'What did our men learn when they grew up with regard to the problem we see now?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for growth in toxic maleness because of its extremely male characters.
He continued, "What was born and what was taught?
What is taught on the TV and in the streets that cause young boys to feel that they should have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because something obviously went wrong with our young men."
in the interview he also acknowledged that he would not take part in any of the Game or Thrones-continuation and-prosecutions when the next summer series came to an end, for he says he's ready with battlefields and horses'.
Since November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a film manufacturer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thought that the best thing that came from Game or Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-crowned fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the site of Leslie’s family landlords in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that there was a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officers.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported alone in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, which represents a change of the past.
Traditionally, HIV rapidly spreads through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who gained HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officers said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS increased with 100,000 people.
MIV transfer by sex is a critical matter in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70 - 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to work on the matter.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member of GOP-senators has made the data leak, condemning 'dangerous lies' and 'coherence theory'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters went out Saturday against claims that a member of her staff had placed the personal information of three Republican US senators on the lawgivers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the accusations were driven by "ultraright" experts and websites.
"Lyes, lies, and yet awesome lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The selected information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for US Sens. Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on-line on Thursday, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol hill during the Senate panel's trial on the claims of sexual misconduct against the appointed Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pondit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the sites was linked to Waters' office and announced the information of a member of a Waters staff, reported the Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff--who's identity, personal information and security were threatened due to this deceitful and false claim--wasn't at all responsible for the exclusion of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally false and a absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly triggered criticism online, including from former Withuis press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies of anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It indicates that she has not the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Meater apparently compared Waters’ response to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of being seemingly too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tried to light Waters in the intermediate election from the kisses, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it is true," he whitted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement bodies of these deceitful claims.
"We will make sure that the masters are revealed," she continued, "and that they will be legally accountable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous for every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Flaw Rowan Atkinson spyspottery
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new film with a British record, and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy spotteryfranchise - which then started with Johnny English in 2003 and further struggled with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will the tongue-in-the-the-the-choice evenatire about the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new export event?
In any case, the unhelped Johnny English with his outpoules and rubber face had his license to waste everything for the second time renew--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film hearers.
Of course, he is the ridiculous secret agent who despite his bisarral pretension to sophisticated elegancy a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr. Bean and a good shot of that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots or Fire-thematic song at the openness of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was also originally based on the traveler and international man of mysteries, which leaves chaos behind him, which Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of YEAR.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter as he was dressed in a mid-century pants and chopped the screw sheets shortly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedie is shown, but the humor feels relatively faint and strangely obsolete, especially when the "very" film trademarks like 007 and Mission Impossible now itself use comedie with confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it is intended for children rather than for adults, and for me Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silences in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious difficulty.
A cuber cracker infiltrated Britain's super secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the distress of the agent in service--a sadly little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a blasted and occupied character, who already experienced a total collapse of political inappropriation: Emma Thomspson does her extreme best with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers notify her that since each active spy has been put in danger, she must call someone out of his retirement.
And this means the troublesome Johnny English himself, now in service as a teacher at some decent institution, but which gives lessons from the record from how to be a secret agent, there are some funny jokes here when English offers a School or Rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency order and is reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a diving boat commander, a all-map roll in which too little of Vicki Pepperdine is expected.
So the Batman and Robin are to completely waste everything in Her Majesty's secret service again and come down to Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls under the dangerous enthusiasm of the charismatic technology billionaire that claims to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey of ridiculous eskapades: embarrassed as kelners put them a French restaurant on fire, they cause chaos when they smuggle themselves on board Volta's luxury hunting; and English lets pure anarchy break off when he tries to use a headpiece for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene nothing is spared, but as nice and exciting as it may be, the whole affair is quite much like child TV.
Reasonably medium-sized.
And like with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: Can't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to his right?
Work denies that it is a plan for British to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Worker Party must consider a drastic plan that will cause British to work a four-day week--but for five days.
The party claims that business bases savings caused by the artificial intelligence revolution (KI) should be transferred to workers by giving them extra day.
It will make workers enjoy a three-day weekend -- but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say that the party's economic agenda and plans to set the country in favor of the workers will fit.
To change to a four-day week was signed by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to exploit the changing economy.
A senior worker party source said to The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an ambitious that fits the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favour of both the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Worker Party will not be the first to sign such an idea, with the Green Party who promised a four-day week during his campaign for the general election in 2017.
The ambition, however, is currently not signed by the entire Worker Party.
A spokesman of the Labour Party said, 'A four-day workweek is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to excuse his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to withdraw power from 'sightless directors' and 'winners' to service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get back their entire investment, since a worker government can make 'depreciation' on the basis of suspected wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on directories of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equivalence in businesses in the private sector to employees, who can get annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 minutes" or the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their opinions.
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh had a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with at least a week delayed and raised the question whether the buro's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley for Republical Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could deepen anything that could make them change their opinion.
Kennedy looked more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Have you done this?
He was determined, definitely, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I have formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett zealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all that she called couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the World Citizen celebration and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be the host of the World Citizen celebration, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizen celebration is now in its seventh year, and during the festival tens of thousands of people will flow to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to create consciousness for the real purpose of the opportunity to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen celebration, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Armoede Project, an international talk group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free card to the event (if you are willing to pay for a BBP card), concertgangers had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as doing volunteers work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to create consciousness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was World Citizen with 12 years remaining in order to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "kicktivisime" - people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twitch?
Since 2011, Worldburger says that it has recorded over 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which support a variety of goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion, potentially affecting the lives of over 2,25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based company of investors and implementers that are connected to "helping children to reach their full potential", and promised to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after getting more than 4,700 twins from World Citizens.
"With the support of the government of the United States, donors, national governments and world citizens as you, we can make the social injustice of underfood become a footnote in history," said the Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman in April 2018 during a concert in London to the crowd.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the general questions on his website that asks "what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
He said, "It will be a long and hard way-- sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists acting at this year's event in New York, which will be offered by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use fleet for "block damage" to stop export of Russian energy--minister of domestic affairs
"If necessary" Washington could leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from falling into the market, including in the Middle East, revealed the U.S. Minister of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works on invitation of the legal government - is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as makers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, southern Europe," he said.
And according to a officer there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are open, and, if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not land on the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the attendants of an opportunity offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profits that viewed themselves as the "move of the energy consumer" in the US.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to the handling of Russia and Iran and noted that it was practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said while he referred to Russia as a "enkeltalent" with a economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The pronouncements come as Trump administration was on a mission to give the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a hip-shot to replace Russia, at far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the officers of the Trump Administration, including America's president Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump Berlin Moscow's "inflicted" project.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capasity up to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kreml argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is merely driven by economic reasons and is an example of unjust competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of carrying out pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with the American Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S.’s views attracted counteract from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI) appealed to the U.S. to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a great problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren's going to consider it "very serious" to stand as president in 2020, said the senator of Massachusetts.
Massachusetts' senator, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday she would consider it "very seriously" to stand as president to the middle-term elections.
During a town meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our broken government and it includes a woman on the highest sport," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider it seriously to stand for President."
Warren stirred her opinion on President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said, "take the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm so deeply worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very pronounced in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
In a two-day Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need a FBI investigation before our voice."
A survey released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should stand in 2020.
Eight-and-fifty percent of "probable" Massachusetts choosers said the senator did not stand, according to Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Twenty-third percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed to stand in 2020 include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont’s senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV by Donald Trump meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and accused of a incident of domestic violence.
"What passes my own son, which he goes through since he came back, I have sympathy with other families who felt the consequences of PTSV and the injuries with which our soldiers return," she said to an audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other warveterans, "they come back a little differently, they come hard back, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air force members and every other member of the army gave to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence, abuse of a woman, intervening with a complaint of domestic violence and possessing a gun while he was under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. support challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the district Columbia support a legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims flying from gang or household violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the- Court jurisdiction in Washington to support a asylum seeker and to challenge the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the claimer in the Grace v. Sessions case submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not made public.
She says her mate "and his violent gang member sons," abused her, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produces a large number of candidates for US Asia, as nations who face deep problems with belts and domestic violence.
In 2014, the new US asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrant Appèlle) that allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents that had fled from domestic violence.
District Columbia's lawyer General Karl Racine said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "decades of government, federal and international laws ignores."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications will be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such lawyer violates that policy," said the friend of the court-law command.
Advocates further argued in the legal order that the policy that refuses immigrants to access, damage the US economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "will provide necessary work."
Advocate General Jeff Sessions in June commanded immigration judges not to allow asylum to victims flying due to domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of the policy on 11 June.
Asiel was never intended to relieve all problems — even not all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Hopeful rescue efforts in Palu while deaths double in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly curious.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her fevery baby son at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute bring an ambulance body.
Clean water is scarce."
Inhabitants have been seen where they return to their devastated homes, searching for perplexed possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed, damaged by the 7.5 range of shaking.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who took a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu’s military hospital, where patients are treated outside because of constantly strong aftersocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells about the violent earthquake that scattered the fifth-depth hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was impressed into the walls' ruins, I think," Haris said to Associated Press and added that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'mobbling' with 'propaganda advertisement'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in a U.S. newspaper that proclaimed the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador for China Beijing accused that the American press was used to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China’s paid deposit in the Des Moines Register – the state of Iowa’s newspaper with most sales – after he accused China of interfering with the U.S. Congress elections of November 6, a complaint that denies China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections, noticed what U.S. officials said to Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington is to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that led to their tariff rounds on each other’s imports.
China’s reimbursement rates early in the trade war aimed at striking exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US scholars said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a great exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, in an opinion in Sunday's Des Moines Register, wrote Branstad, "very much worse now the mobbing by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"By the spread of their propaganda, the Chinese government attacks America's dear tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited deviations and not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people have on China's worrying economic traject, that media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers had shattered away from the offer to publish his article," although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans entrance women choosers for intermediate elections with Kavanaugh debakel, warning analysts
While many top-republics stand at High Court-Downlined Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various claims of sexual abuse, analysts warned that they would see counteract during the coming intercourse, especially from women.
The emotions of this are extremely high, and most Republicans are recorded that they already indicate that they want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s request for a FBI investigation on the trick would be enough to pause fierce voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to Washington, D.C.-courant.
On Friday morning, demonstrators "November is on their way!" droneed while they argued in the entrance of the Senate, while the Republicans who chose the Judge Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the evidence of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an inpartial political analyst, to the newspaper.
"People say it was already high; that's true.
But it can be higher, especially among women in the premises and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who do not often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public evidence that set out the details of her accusation of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court, analysts said that a reaction could be followed if Republicans continued to confirm.
"It became a breakdown for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former Chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice and whether Kavanaugh is put on the court, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to prefer Democrats, exhibited to the news channel.
But Americans seem slightly divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a little more that chooses the latter’s side.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely believe or probably Ford's testimony, while 35 say that they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitively yoking during his witness, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s claim, the FBI is currently investigating the accusations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford last week under oath before the Senate’s Judgment Committee witnessed that Kavanaugh had attacked her at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court-downed his family parts revealed to her while they attended a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new internet to say the fight to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, leads an initial business that is trying to deal with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology-learner's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee ridiculed that the idea with Inrupt is "world rule".
"We must do it now," he said about the project.
"It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is completely based on the user who can gain access to that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorisation by data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralised applications by using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about the announcement of a total change if or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a location on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee converted the Internet when he founded the World-wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while he leads Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the World-wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am immense optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross celebrate
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross during World War I was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt.kol honor Bernard Vann acquired the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was killed by a sharp shooter and never knew that he had acquired the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed on Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "bright symbolic" that the stone is revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's crowned performance.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, his bataljon led over the Channel de Saint-Quentin "by a lot of dense and under heavy fire from the field and machine weapons."
Later he hurried to the fireline and led the line forward with the "greatest braveness" before he only stormed a man's gun and broke out three of the department.
Lt.kol Vann was killed on October 4, 1918 by a German sharp shooter – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action is "something I know I can never do, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a crown to the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orkes.
Michael Vann said, "he felt annoyed to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people will give."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to see the follow - up Bellator 206, just not able to see the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be posted directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o’clock, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, watchers in the UK were stumbled when the covering changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were impressed after staying awake specially for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the switch to the child signprint as "one or other sick joke."
"It is government regulation that the content was not suitable at 6 p.m. and so they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice-president of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include U.K. watchers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the re-send, I think we can probably work out something," said Coker.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it turned over, there were many SMSs that were sent down and again, and it was not all kind.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six — as we normally do — and we tried to offer more for our followers and just went over our time.
This is an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's feeling 'neverworthy' about sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with a feeling of inferiority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't know before he went to high school that "not everyone like me."
When he talked on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he aired his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that having become a parent, he was less concerned about winning at the Olympic Games.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took off a few months due to disease.
When he appeared as a distortion on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else when he grew up, for "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings were of less feeling than, and otherwise, the real things that gave me the power and energy to achieve success."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he would not disappoint anyone when they would finally find out about his sexuality.
The double olympic bronze medal winner became a high profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's State League games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He says he aired his feelings because he is so happy to live openly without consequences and wants to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that to be in love with a man – US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "fucked him opposed."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than he, but said the age difference was never a question.
"When you suffer so much at such a young age" – he went at 14 years to his first Olympic Games and his father died three years later of cancer – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar heights and lowest points.
The couple became parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a golden medal'," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic golden medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert who died at 40 years of age in 2011 after diagnosing brain cancer.
Daley says that his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had cards for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him, 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he had stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not inconvenient," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won sources.
"I just knew that this was what I dreamed about for my life – to dive before my home armies at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song choice – Proud by Heather Small — who also resonated with him in building to the Olympic Games and still give him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson didn't drive and withdraw from Saturday's Rider Beker
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th rider game, but he will have to succeed in preventing it from being an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record-12th time in the two-year event, was withdrawn by Captain Jim Furik for Saturday's four-ball games and four-numbers.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day between it to be a racialist and on the exercise bow work on his game in the hope of correcting what's going on.
Even at the climax of his career he was never the most straight driver and so the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long rufield always punishs the miserable teams.
And as if the job wasn't challenging enough on its own, Mickelson came in his ninth competition against the precise British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who had joined newman Tommy Fleetwood to win all their four competitions this week.
If the Americans, which are four points behind, start the 12 single game games well, Mickelson’s competition can be absolutely vital.
Furik expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood his role that he had today, gave me a knock on the back and put his arm around me and said he'd be right tomorrow," said Furik.
"He had a lot of confidence in himself.
He was in the Holocaust, and in the past and this week he contributed so much to these teams.
Probably, I did not imagine that he would play two bets.
I set more in the prospect, but that is how things worked out and that we thought we should do.
He wants to be on the track, just as anyone else."
Mickelson will surpass on Sunday Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most Ryderbeker games.
It can mark the end of a rider's career that never really matched the highlights of his individual performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 nederlays, and seven halfs, although Furik said that his presence contributed to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, taken, like to screw the bullshit, and he's a wonderful old to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving crazy with him, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just game."
Europe-captain Thomas Bjorn knows great predecessor can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advance before the last day's single game in the Ryderbeker can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Deen made its debut in the 1997 competition at Valderrama, where the team under the leadership of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point front, but only won nail scrap with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"'You keep reminding yourself that we had a great precursor at Valderrama; we had a great precursor at Brookline, where we had lost, and at Valderrama, where we had won nail scrap," said Bjorn, on the photo, after he had watched the class of 2018 won 5-3 Friday and was before yesterday 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone at the team that it isn't over.
You're going plenty tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I still say all the time, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are also well aware of who stands on the other side – the best players in the world."
Happy about how his players went on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never go ahead with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different colour.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes up, and it's a horse of a different color.
It's wonderful to be out there with a mate when things go well, but when you're individually there, you're tested to your full capacity as a golf player.
This is the message you need to transmit to players, the best of yourself comes tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate, and he shall also find the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his equivalent Jim Furik would want his players to pass more individually than they did as gaming partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Fureich himself had been on both sides of that big last day remnant, where he was part of the wish pan at Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe achieved the "wonder of Medinah".
"I remember every distortive word of it," he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 had spoken his players courageously on the way to that last day.
"We have 12 important competitions tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as was seen at Brookline, as was seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle competitions.
We set up our team accordingly, and divided the men that we felt, you know, will bring us some magic tomorrow."
Thomas had the task of trying to lead the counterattack and come in the main competition against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I have chosen this group of guys in this order, because I think it covers it up to the end," said Bjorn about his single game options.
Germany’s New Warship Resigned
The German army’s newest fregat would have been operated in 2014 to replace the old war vessels from the Cold War-era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to malicious systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The use of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the headship of the splinterneue Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregatte was now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit-Kurant quoting a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the fleet in 2014, but the emerging post delivery issues plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels ordered the fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen class fregatte.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle-order airfire and anti-ship missions as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to explode the latest fregates for up to two years away from home homes.
However, continuous delays mean that the advanced warships — which obviously will enable Germany to project power overseas — will be already aged by the time they enter into service, calls The Time.
The catastrophic F125 fregat made records last year when the German fleet officially refused to operate the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Vosskeepsyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet sent a ship back to delivery to a shipbuilder.
Few are known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware-defects" make the ship useless if it is exploded in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the male force on older Bremen class fregatte.
It also revealed that the ship is drastic overweight, reducing the performance and reducing the fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tonnes of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are likely to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides the bad hardware, the price label for the entire project — including the training of the crew — has also affected a question.
Apparently, it reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems of the new fregates become particularly important in view of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is crumbling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defense Committee, admitted that the fleet's "ships that can be exploded are getting up."
The official manager said that the issue was worsening in time, for old ships were put out of service, but no substitute vessels were provided.
He lamented that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the fleet.
National Trust Listens to Wings’ Secret Life
New research is carried out on a landing in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how wing mice use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will cast new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow both the ordinary and sopranian wrestling mouse and the brown long ear and Daubenton wings at Inverean Tuine in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on the property at important locations to track wing Mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile recordings using hand indicators.
Expert class channels of all surveys will check the regularity of the wing mouse calls and determine what species are doing.
A Habitat Card and Report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a natural protection adviser for NTS hopes will reveal the results which areas of the habitat are most important for the wing mice and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how to manage forest lands at the best for wing mice and other associated species.
Floormus populations in Scotland and across the United States have decreased considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping space and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of construction materials, as well as attacks by house cats.
Wings are not really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated EO-orientation technology to show gaggas and obstacles on their flight routes.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about wings.
It has ten trained experts who regularly perform surveys and sleepplace inspections and sometimes perform salvations.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first and only dedicated wing mouse reserve at Threave landgoed in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of Scotland’s ten wing mouse species.
Landlord David Thompson says that the landing is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for wings," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many fatter trees and all the good habitat.
But there are so many about wing Mouses that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He emphasizes the need to seek for wing Mouses before maintenance in property is done because it is possible that unconscious destruction of a single cavity can mean to 400 females and young people's death and can eradicate a whole local population.
Floor Mouse is protected, and it is illegal to kill, disturb, or prevent them from destroying sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our wings and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo kills rape guns while lawyers prepare for German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo killed rape-attacks against him as "false news" and said that people want to promote herself by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to explore German news magazine, Der Spiegel, that published the claims.
The Portugal and Juventus leader was accused of raising an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel.
It is said that he paid her $375,000 to stay silent over the inside, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addresses his 142 million followers, hours after the claims were published, Ronaldo, 33, completed the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or-winer to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it is part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is right," the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyer is ready to declare Der Spiegel about the claim, which, according to Reuters, they called "unacceptable reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would claim reimbursement for "moral compensation for any amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
Accordingly, the claimed insident took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where he believed to rape her anally, according to documents submitted at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to the claimed insident on his knees and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" that was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had taken photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "bang for revenge" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she now wants to reverse the design because she still has been traumatized by the claimed insident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the claimed assault at the point of joining from Manchester United to Real Madrid and moved this summer, in a $100 million agreement to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will lose their automotive manufacturers forever repentance.
The United Kingdom 'will repent forever' if they lose their status as a world leader in car production to Brexit, Drive Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it's "apprehensive" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, it's temporarily to stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-compliance-Brexit, posts could cost.
The Burnaston plant — which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis — produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's manager at Burnaston.
Other UK motor manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have aired fears of leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
For example, BMW said they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automotive manufacturers say launch chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "non-time" basis, with components that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there may be disruption on the border that the industry may say can lead to delays and shortages of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relationships with the EU was "pretty calibrated to avoid those controls at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only the current success but for us to take this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota but also other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to continue with what was an extremely successful set of launch chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but warned that added costs at the long term could reduce the company’s competitiveness and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite-Union's fellow caller on the plant, his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, it will never come back again.
A President-in-Office said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says Withuis.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with Adjunct-General Rod Rosenstein can be "suspended with another week" while the fighting about nominated for the High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh continued, the Withuis Sunday said.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special lawyer Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian election interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia and possible cross-bombing of justice by the President.
Whether Trump is going to dismiss the adjunct-general, or not, and thereby threatening Mueller's independence, has been inspiring Washington's slide stories for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of having a recorder to take up conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he went to the Withuis, in the midst of reports that he was on his way to thank.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, which was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he'd "koos to not thank" for Rosenstein, but then the meeting was suspended to avoid a conflict with the Senate court court in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump loaded a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and the full Senate vote further.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "A date for it is not yet determined, it can be this week, I can see that it is postponed with another week with all the other things that go to the High Court.
But we will see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists will differ with that statement: Sanders have not yet held a Withuis press information session since 10 September.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the scarceness of information sessions is not because of an opposition to TV journalists who are "effek hunting," although she said, "I will not fight with their effective hunting."
She then indicated that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without quoting evidence: "We have looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will continue to take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than to talk to me.
We're trying to do a lot and you've seen us do a lot in the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the Withuis or participates in open sessions or press statements with visiting dignity dressers.
Solo press statements are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbound and at times, bisarr appear to journalists who were there together.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to show the country's gratitude and express the wish to stay to Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months before the United Kingdom withdrawn from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed them to covering the costs of processed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government also intensified their preparations for a possible non-compliance scenario.
I know it is a very distressing time for all of you.
That is why I want to repeat how much I pay for each personnel’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Collegas from all over the EU and further bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health service, and benefit from the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we very much want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he had suffered a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 down against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee Team's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State’s chief trainer Rod Reed told journalists that the injury had occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the margin and collapsed the kind of just there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave oxygen to Abercrombie along the side before he was placed on a portable and taken back for further evaluation.
An officer of Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details about the type/range of injury," and Tennessee still trys to detect when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
On Saturday, he killed five times before leaving the game, which brings his total stand for the season on 18 deaths.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to draw young choosers
The seal tax will be charged on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Tesurie expects to collect up to $120 million a year — to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless ones, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to draw young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be lifted on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional money that will help the government’s plans to combat homelessness.
The additional tax — which is beyond the current seal tax, including the higher levels set up two years ago on second homes and houses purchased to hire — can be up to more than three percent.
The Tesourie expects that this move can bring up to £120 million a year.
A estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are purchased by non-UK citizens who suspend the prices and make it more difficult for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become "ghost villages" because of the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping their property prices high by raising land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs. May to remove quotas on affordable houses to restore Britain's "course disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rental management and an end to "no error-exceptions".
He also wants to give advice greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my Prime Ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And this means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK as well as foreign - based companies to buy homes as for hardworking British residents.
For too many people the dream of house ownership has become a fabulous dream and the humiliation of homelessness a too great reality."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland'
Sunderland-boas Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at a time.
The Scotland, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new lives in the North-East team, currently in the third place in Liga One, three points below the top.
He moved this summer to the Stadium of Light after he had brought St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I got the second team, but it was all," Ross said to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But as a child, I often watched with my father for Scotland at Hampden and this is something that pulled me back.
However, the event can only come if I'm successful with club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic Boss said he felt no anxiety to follow such established names at such a great club, after he had previously rejected presentations of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success will be measured for me by ''Can I make this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it certainly belongs to the Premier-liga," he said.
"It's not a easy job to get it there, but I'll probably only view myself as successful if I can get the club out there again."
Ross' career in the driving is only three years, after a period of assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' deputy staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third liga and St Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing course at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroads," he said when he thought back to how he took Alloa's leaders.
"I really believed the driving was the right place for me, even more than to play.
It sounds bisar, for I have done well enough, made a reasonable existence of it, and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things to come through every week.
I continue to go through it with regard to the stress and pressure of work, but driving feels just right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my mature life."

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 a.m. on a Saturday, recording found
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s difficult crows’s income, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking sites and barrel groups saw sales rising by 2.7% in July — but receipts in restaurants were off by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of Business Consultation Company CGA, who composed the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England’s longer than expected participation in the World Beker meant that Julie followed a similar pattern as the previous month, June, when drinking places were on with 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The fall of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only increased in July.
Drankie - guided drinking sites and bars did better on distances and increased more than restaurants had dropped.
Cos-led drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators.
It looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Over the whole driven bars and drinking places increased sales by 6.6 percent for the month, with food was off by three percent."
Paul Newman, of recreational and hospitality analists RSM said: "These results continue the tendency we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of major social or sport events remains the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-the-house-out-market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a fall in sales of 4.8 per cent of years will be particularly difficult above and except continuous cost pressure.
The long hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-leading operators and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that we have experienced since August would bring necessary relief."
Total growth in sales throughout drinking sites and restaurants, including new places opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the delay in trademark notices.
The Coffer Peach Tracker business sales monitor for the UK's drinking site, bargain and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data of 47 business groups, with a joint conversion of more than £9 billion and is the established standard in the industry.
One out of five children has secret social media accounts that hide them from their parents.
One out of five children – some as young as 11 – has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers reveal a survey
Inclusion of 20 000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta-pages"
The news increased fears that sexual content is placed
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head account" to show parents.
One out of five children — some as young as 11 — creates social media accounts that keep them secret to adults.
A survey of 20 000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "false Insta accounts" – a reference to the Instagram photo section.
The news increased fears that sexual content is placed.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "head account" to show parents, but also have private accounts.
One mother who came down to her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard, found a teenager who encouraged others to "trap her".
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them who admit that they have private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said, "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces online where parents and teachers cannot detect them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "speaking for athletes" in Scotland athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Council of Scotland athletics as a non-executive director at the control body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated job and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level during the last decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK, and world athletics society, and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit much from what she brings to the advice," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes and hope I can really contribute and help to the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under its four golden Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after he had a short-term ischemical attack.
He wrote on Twitter, "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only the time would learn if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhaustive work, but it was fully restored, learned again how to walk, and doing pleasant exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Brushes path revert that mothers compare to cows divide opinies online
A breast pump company shared opinions online with an advertisement that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows that are milked.
To celebrate the leading of what is called the "world's first silent borst pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choos music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that gives the pump to mothers that milk out.
Four real mothers dance in a shaft full of straw and cows on the size of a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "If you haven't seen, it's not eggs, it's my breasts."
The choir section says, "Pomp it out, pump it out, I carry out the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reaction from spectators, with many who say it plays the "wrecks" of the milk industry.
"Very weak decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Nes we must be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen within days after they have born," one wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a nutrition bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another one noted: “Intelligently traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why does it not use to advertise a breast pump to mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The ad is so out of feeling."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman who admitted that the song was "crazy" for her.
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would have had one if I had still breastfeeded.
To milk out, I just felt like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a genius product," wrote one.
Another said: "It's a nice advertisement directed to mothers who milk out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows".
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discrete pump in their brass.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk out say that they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is silent, has no wires or tubes, and is just discreet in a nutrient bridge that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they milk out.
Ana Balarin, vennoot and UKD at Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a large and exciting announcement.
By dragging a parallel between women who milked and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milk process and all its challenges in the light, while we in a entertaining way that people can find the wonderful sense of freedom that will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump brought the news.
During London Modeweek, a mother of two appeared on the walking plank for designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of continuing migrant children increased sharply although monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly due to severe retoric and policies set up by the Trump administration that make it more difficult to place children in debts.
Traditionally, most of the guarantees were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to remain in the country was put in danger by stepping forward to demanding a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guarantees and other mature members of their households should make their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and customs maintenance before the Congress witnessed that the agency had arrested thousands of people who had applied for the unprecedented retirement of minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are either deposits or household members of deposits are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children faster, officials set up new rules that would require some of them to appear in the court within a month after arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to secret workers.
Many will appear through video conference calls, rather than in person, to address their case for legal status at an immigration judge.
Those considered unfit for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain in arrest, the more likely they will become anxious or depressive, which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape efforts, according to secret workers and reports that have come out of the system in the past months.
Advocates say that those anxiety is increased at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child's difficulty are easily missed because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the town of tente without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say goodbye to friends, can worsen the trauma that many have already been having.
Syria tells U.S., French and Turkish 'besetting forces' to withdraw immediately.
When he spoke to the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war in his eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as the Prime Minister of Adjunct, said that the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian ground, under the pretext to fight terrorism and will be "to be handled accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with still millions who have been rooted, has been "more over".
He said that Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we cleaned all Syrian areas" of both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States trained and advised some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly against both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabians against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - tempered country.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were all right for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irracial fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to fasilize these return," he said.
"They politics something that should be just a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats have said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last big rebel settlement of Idlib, created an opportunity to continue with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement had a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem emphasized that the agreement had "clare sperms" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front that will be "extined".
UN Senator, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon call together the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to set up a post-war constitution for Syria and to set up the way to elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to the "comprehensive of the articles of the present constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals early end his presidentship.
In what undoubtedly "the most dramatic final of a presidency will ever be!"
Until now there are no signs of watching fatigue.
Since 2014, CCN has doubled more than 1.05 million at the CCN and almost threefolded up to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million top-time viewers, of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top of cable views with as much as 3.5 million viewers on large news evenings.
"It's a fire to which people were attached, because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC Drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary that becomes president after an attack destroyed the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedie writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Snowing Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," said another theory.
She remembers a taxirit in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?, she asked.
"He said, "Because he lets me laugh," I told Scovell.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
And yet it goes beyond being just a informed citizen when you are in the sixth hour of being watching how a panel of experts debates about Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 straw-learning-flying bay ("a clothing thick of the hubris," said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he runs you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, manager of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role division and daily kinks in the plot (such as looking for a dispute with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you stay behind.
When I reached this week for Mr. Fleiss, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while he took CNN.
He could not rip him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh was on the way to appear before the Senate’s Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the scale.
"I remember when we did all that crazy programs then and people said, 'It's the beginning of the end of the Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Outside money flows to the most exciting medium-term selection races in home
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees a flow of money, thanks to a shift of convention districts that has now brought two officials into a race to the same seat.
The recently changed pre-city Pittsburg district makes democratic rep. Conor Lamb – which won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – meet forces.
Lamb stands against another official, the Republic of Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlapps heavy with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania High Court in January decided that the old districts were unconstituted in the Republicans’ favor.
The race in the new 17th was suspended with a campaign financing competition between the large parties’ financial legs, the Democratic Veldtog Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Field Trip Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nail screw won in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congress district.
The seat was held by a republikan for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats some advantage.
U.S. considered to penalize El Salvador rather than support China, but then returned
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until vennotes had excluded the Trump Organization's driving team.
Officers of the State Departments decided to withdraw the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the "lasting decisions not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the deputy spokesman of the department, earlier this month in a statement.
However, fines were just considered against El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including reduction in financial assistance and tested visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials posted a high-level convention and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar convention last year that was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top-administration officials made it clear that they wanted the convention to continue to effectively put an end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Adjunct President Mike Pence was now appointed to speak to the congress, now planned for midoctober, as a sign of the seriousness of the assembly for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American missionaries returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new severe messages or straws from Washington.
A Withuis spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion under the condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analist who was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that can happen can be the special discussion of Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible cross - bombing of the court, of which there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller probably also focuses on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in the country’s attack on our elections.
Would the Congress pass in other hands, Mr. Trump would have to stare accountability in the face of that body, just when he prepared to go again before the voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his group.
It is a lot of asses, and I do not want to indicate that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – and not that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are decisions to be taken on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched out.
In 1938 German officials were ready to execute a state arrest against Hitler, if the West had only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of killing that followed.
The course of history is turning around such turnpoints and democracy’s uncomfortable course is speeded or delayed.
Americans are now staring in sight of several such turning points.
What will we do as Mr. Trump adjunct-general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in warm water since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested to take the president in secret and speculate about whether he was competent for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times’s report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or just – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and unfair evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the intercourse for a convention that will keep responsible for Mr. Trump?
If we watch those tests, there is a long winter in front of democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi rule that once lived in my ambassador's house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to pitch the Sabbath-cars on that table that wears the swastica.
With this as my origin, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistics before Rapid Vienna game
Rangers play Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna with the knowledge that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equation in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of Europe Liga.
A knee injuries prevented the middle field player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2-equal outlook against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springing place for larger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the competition with the conviction that we could get something and walked away there with a point.
Maybe we could have won it at the end, but an equal score is probably a righteous outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult competition, because they had a good outcome in their last race, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can persist and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly difficult, with all that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a well-feel-factor at the place.
The group is good, and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now press, sit behind us last season and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this retirement pair of money fear
Despite the fact that record participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationalwide study said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they had talked to their children about it.
"Man wants a family member to care for them, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nationalwide's life insurance business.
Here is true to begin.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes long before.
Work with your adviser and your family to preach where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial adviser: Your adviser can also help you to come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding decisions for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenditure or self-security with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut off legal disputes at the passport.
Get a health care volunteer instead so that you instruct a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and to ensure that experts fulfil your wishes if you can't communicate.
Also consider authorized for your finances.
You need to choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incompatible.
Do not forget the small details: Think that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details in a written plan so you're ready.
"It's not just the financial issues in question, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medication?
Who will care for the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man several times shot in Ilfracombe with windbows
A man was shot several times with a windbow when he went home tonight out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a "eventual act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life - threatening, and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were dead because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city Palu Friday, officials said, and the death number is expected to rise.
With non-actional communication, relief officers could not get any information from Donggala regeneration, a area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5 range of shaking.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to security after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central-Sulawesi province, located on the point of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a regent that stretches along more than 300 km (180 miles) coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regent, a administrative area under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the support pillars of the central-Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been struck several times over the past 100 years by tsunamis, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit West-Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the Seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the big earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A great shaking along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, which led to a tsunami that hit 14 countries, resulted in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shakes hit the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds died in the island of Nias, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 area hit the south of Java, Indonesia was the most populated island, which led to a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 range of shaking hit near the city Padang, capital of the West-Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: One of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, hit a 7.5 - foot [7.5 m] tsunami that destroyed dozen villages and resulted in about 300 deaths.
2016: A plain shaking hit the Pidie Jaya rule in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shaking and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were dead because of buildings that crashed,
2018: Great scatters hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the north side of the island.
The shaking destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily scattered.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he picked up a woman's phone when she called the police to report the claimed crimes.
Palin is in captivity at Mat-Su Insurance Facility and is held on a $500 uninsected deposit, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared "innocent, decisive" when asked what he appealed, reported the network.
Palin stares three class A violations in the face, which means he can be locked up for up to a year and $250,000 being paid.
He is also accused of a class B violation, punishable with a day in prison, and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal complaints were brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the claimed attack.
The case is currently serving before Alaska’s Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interfering with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possessing a gun while he was drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed that he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after connecting her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds died
At least 384 people died after a earthquake hit the Indonesian island Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 range of earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks were put out of action with death rates expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit just outside the central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people met for a beach celebration in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are looking for rare death sentences for suspicious in NYC terrorist attacks
Federal prosecutors in New York seek the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspicious in the New York City terrorist attack that caused eight people’s death – a rare punishment that has not yet been executed in the State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to attack a bike path along the West Side motorway in Laer Manhattan to harvest footgoers and a bike rider that was in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "consciously" and "consciously" caused serious physical injuries, according to the announcement of intention to ask for the death penalty, incorporated into the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges may carry death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal large jury of Saipov struck with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the purpose of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "fair planning and predecessorship", said prosecutors and described the way Saipov executed it as "disgusting, cruel, and pervers".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has injured, damaged and lost the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," said the intention notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has been over since then, the Southern District of New York has legally persecuted a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for the murder of two drug providers, but was finally sentenced to lifelong prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York, was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been killed after they were sentenced for a complot to perform spy for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were teased with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not prove repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He pointed out to detectors that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after he had watched ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He innocently appealed to the 22 accusations.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "naturally disappointed" with the decision of the persecution.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than to accept a debt recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release, only the trauma of these events will extend to all the involved." Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team earlier asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be put in control of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians had to feel the "heated" of Euroscheptians – since one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he had to be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told the March in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "out" at the time if Mr. Farage Brexit was secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faced to unite her deeply divided officers was indicated by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggled to keep her Chequers compromise plan in force in the midst of attacks of Brexiteers, Remains and the EU.
Confessions insisted that she would press through in her efforts to make an agreement with Brussels despite the death-going – and force Euroscheptici and Arbeid to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said to the Run meant Run-congress in Solihull that he wanted to throw out "Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage had to be made a noble man and the responsibility was given for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was in control, we would have been out by the time,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added, 'I will rise up for Brexit, but we must throw Chequers out.'
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that since the 2016 vote, public opinion has changed: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to remain is totally false.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also on March and said to reporters: ‘ I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
‘Chequers are uncomfortable with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is uncomfortable with our party and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure that we are chosen first.
Please let Chequers go and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: 'First ministers must keep their work when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farge reported that the convention politicians had to feel the "heated" if they were at the threshold to want to violate the decision taken in the 2016 reference.
'It's about a trust case between us--the people--and our political class,' he said.
‘ They try to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them ‘We will not get away with it.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: ‘ I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
‘We mobilise the people’s army of this country that has given our victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-regierung, proud United Kingdom.’
Meanwhile, Remainers marched by Birmingham before they held a convention for two hours in the city centre.
A few activists turned tours against Brexit Baniers and the announcement of the group this weekend.
Arbeidedelman Lord Adonis ridiculed the conservatives for the security issues they had endured with a party application like the conference opened.
'That's the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus instead, for the free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.
'It's a complete cleverness.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to 'look hard' to stand for President.
U.S. Sen Elizabeth Warren says she will "look hard to stand for President" nà the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat talked about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular criticism of President Donald Trump, stands for re-selection in November against the GOP state of Rep Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been in the middle of speculation that his Trump may be challenged in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents with the use of the city hall format since Trump was in charge.
A attendee asked her if she planned to stand for president.
Warren answered that it was time for women to go to Washington to correct our broken government, and it includes a woman very above."
Arrest made in shooting death of LSU’s Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA., announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting death of LSU basket player Wayne Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, at 11 p.m.
They released a video from the shooting event Friday and asked for help to identify a man seen in the image material.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early Friday near Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims got a shot wound in the head and finally died because of it," said police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media at 247 sports Saturday.
Wayde endeavored to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned, and admitted that he was on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 younger who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 competitions with 10 fronts last season and maintained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 backspring balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton climbs the world title after team commands gave him his winning over Sebastian Fetttel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualifyed Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the races.
From pale position, Bottas had a good start, and almost won for Hamilton as he had defended his position in the first two turns, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fattel first entered the wells and left Hamilton to drive into the traffic very behind the bundle, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes took a round later and came out behind Boltle, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-to-cycle action that the Ferrari driver had disgustingly lost risk-free the inside seen at danger of endurance to a double movement to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row from the jumper and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led to a large part of the races as he held on his bands to quickly finish and cross Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
He may have arrived at the wells on the 44th round, but could not accelerate his passport in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen took the fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastic all weekends and was a true lord.
The team did outstanding work to have one-two," said Hamilton.
It had been a ugly bad elevator.
President Donald Trump laughed on Saturday at a conference Senator Dianne Feinstein over her incitement that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which she charged the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
The president spoke at a convention in West Virginia and did not directly address the testimony that Ford had given before the Senate Court Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "gemenged and uncovered and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has happened over the past few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are evil and foolish and liars," he said.
"When you look at statements and leakages and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lie?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document--"Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak it."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak it... No, we didn't leak it," he added, in a condition of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that declared the accusations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was previously leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the leakage had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't leak her story," said Feinstein to the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not consider her denial well and commented during Saturday evening's assembly, "I tell you what. It was a pleasant bad lift.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst elevator I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court-Downloader accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the commonness, the incredibleness, they don't care about who they hurt, who they should drive around to get power and control," reported the president.

Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning Saturday the opposition 5-3 in Dundee.
The Giants got a early two-target lead by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team straight before Dwyer restored the Giants ’ direction.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee up before two Luke Lundvald Nielsen goals caught their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who first lost competitions and then won on Friday evening Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants who won the previous three races.

Air traffic manager dies to make sure hundreds on a plane can escape earthquake
A air traffic manager in Indonesia is viewed as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane that carried hundreds of people was safely lifted up.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, and a tsunami caused.
There are still strong after shocks in the area, and many are trapped in breakdowns in the city of Palu.
But in spite of his colleagues who fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that had swiftly swept on the Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained unmovable to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was at that time on the runway, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he day it threw together.
Later he died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear about this," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death number can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster satisfaction agency, which says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of deaths continues to increase, since many bodies are still under the building valleys while many cannot yet be reached," said Agent Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Gulfs reaching up to six feet [6 m] smelled Palu, who will keep a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and stock.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute brings in an ambulance body.
Clean water is rare.
The minimarks are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is hunting to help survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s military service: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete every task related to dismantling.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, in which more than 550 people had died.
Micronesia Airplane accident: Air Niugini says if one man is missing after the beach sea plane accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed down in a Pacific Sea in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely cleared the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they couldn't give account of a male passenger.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectors to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officers said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers had stayed in the hospital Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane had landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had arrived very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others managed to walk through medium - deep water until the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the airguards had paniced and screamed and that he had suffered a small headache.
The U.S. fleet said that shipowners who worked close to the improvement of a key also helped with a blastable boat with salvation to land people all over and over before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 foot)’s water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have been killed in collapses of PNG registered airlines in the past two decades, but Air Niugini had been involved in one.
Analists set the timeline of the evening that woman was burned alive
The state closed his case on Saturday in the hearing of a man who was accused of having burned a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice-Analis Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence-analysis.
He explained for the jury how he used mobile records to gather the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the evening that he was dead.
Rowlett said that he had received location data from different mobile phones showing that Tellis was together Chambers the evening of her death, which was in opposition to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed Saturday that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked him whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was in Sanford's dress, Sanford said, "yoke, because my dress was in Nashville."
No inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls and contact information removed from his phone.
"He surely made her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was planned to start its final vocals Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A Hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genres by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip-hop moved away from its origin of political messages and the approach of social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop again popular.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurrection in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
No black person?
NY-Barn-Juffrou marrys couple because she's dismissed to "racist" text.
A New York children's boyfriend marchs a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrong-recipient message from the mother who complained that she was "now a black person".
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the thing with "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her distress when she learned that the new child career, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEE NOW A SWART PERSON," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After she discovered her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed me Maurice and said that their outgoing child hunter who was Africa-American did bad work and that she rather expected a Philippineer, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home with a Uber.
Now Maurice takes the couple for compensation over the discharge and seeks his compensation to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, inhabiting work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do so well," she told the Post on Friday and added "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the claims that they were racist and said that it was the reasonable thing to terminate Maurice’s claim and fear that they would not be able to trust her after they had offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said Joel Plasco the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone with whom you were uncovered, even if it had been by abus?
Your newborn baby?
Let's go."
Plasco compared the case with "expression" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going to pursue such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," added the investment banker.
While the case continues, the court of public opinion had been fast to put the couple on social media and cut them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a speaking bear would not link readers.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
It is very amusing that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been fierce if she had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the small toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's announcement after his death was "bitter sweet" last year.
About Paddington, who she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a silent man and he wasn't an applause man," she said.
"But because Paddington was genuine to him, it was almost as if you had a child that had reached something: you are proud of them, even though it isn't your work.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success of that kind.
Though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the glory of Paddington himself."
My daughter died and I had to greet the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was hunted to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect she would do it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I must have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heartlam.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors gave her to hold her heart on the knock were slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was avoured.
I couldn't check or cry or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to assemble it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had been hurt at that time for the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers on board the plane - unconscious of the trial she had gone.
"None knew," she said.
"I had my head dropped and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Faithful Women Post Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved for suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been sending cards for a while on a Wallic bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to lead to depression and killed himself at 18.
"I want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said that her son was a promised shepherd with an infectious smile.
"All knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile had lightened any room."
However, he gave up work before he was dead, because he was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother found his brother after he took his own life.
Me Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a domino-effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go to and to whom you can talk to, even if it is a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you have to talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas he reached the lowest point - when the children opened their gifts, he did not make an eye contact or something with them."
She said his death was very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: "It cuts a hole through the family.
It screws us out.
But we shall all go and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still uncertain as the FBI investigates
"I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for--a timeless investigation that had not taken any-- could we perhaps bring a bit of unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was falling out" under scattered partisan gathering.
Why would Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters haven't wanted to set up the FBI's investigation?
Their opposition is all because of time calculation.
The intermediate choices are only weeks away, on November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans are badly passing, then they will be very weakened in their efforts to get the man whom they want to prefer to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the Withuis and met by him his wife Ashley, and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI delivered his report?
There will be a voice in the senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can come up to at least 50 votes on the senate floor that Mike Pence, the vice president, will allow to break a equality and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea overruns numbers 'down' under Kim
The number of North Korean overruners to South Korea has fallen since then Kim Jong-un came to rule seven years ago, a South Korean lawyer said.
Park Byeong - virgins quoted data from the South Uniformation Cabinet and said that there were 1,127 lapses last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and China and higher rates as requested by human smugglers have been key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The large majority of overruns from the north are finally offered South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight through Shina, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protected demilitarized zones (DMS) between the two Koreans.
Shina considers the overflowers as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, who remain technically speaking in war with each other, have significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang met for conversations centered around the striking negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historical meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to cooperate for the nuclear Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanks for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unanimously disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a speech to the UN General Meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeries," he says he's incapable of serving at the Supreme Court.
Home minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court-downed Brett Kavanaugh "histeries" and said that he was temperamentally incapable of serving at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help to think that if a woman had ever acted like this, they would say 'hearts'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's jurisdiction Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost screamed and stuck while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly disapproved Democrats to the committee and called the claims against him a "sacred and coordinated character luipord", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, because it showed that he was prejudiced to Democrats.
"I think he makes himself incompatible with those statements and the way he went behind the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to complain about Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and as Democrats win the majority in the Lower House.
"I will say it -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he is not qualified to be at the Supreme Court, but to be at the court where he is now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ummegang Appèlhof.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was worried about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on Deservable Sorg or Roe v. Wade since he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would put certain Supreme Court decisions on the ground.
"It's not time for a hysteric, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'isn't it wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women must handle it.
It is a righteous diatribe, months, and years of anger that cooks, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer anywhere, who also said that she was crying when she got angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began to cry, she would say to the person she spoke to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a partial exit for tomb because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of a early work in a male-dominated office was where I once found that I was crying with nameless anger and at my necklace gripped by an older woman--a cold driver for whom I was a little afraid--which dragged me into a trapportal.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy, because they had an impact on you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congress woman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidency campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart in an out-marriage relationship called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she couldn't investigate the idea that she could run for President.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Sneewi and the Seven Dwergies".
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with finding collections and so she made a vow that she would not enter the races unless she had collected $2 million.
It had been a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would only give her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a resignation?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions - grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target voters rather than delegates, and angry for the sexism - that she had stuck.
You would have thought I had a nerve-infringement," recalled me Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporative deposit.
I remember thinking, what are they going to sit on my tomb stone?
"She's crying?"
How the US-China trade war might be good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China had been overdestructive and while the battle is far away, a conflict between the countries may be in the long term beneficial to Beijing, says experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, had fired the first warning earlier this year by loading important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most interesting escalation rolled in this week with new rates affecting $200 billion ($150 billion)’s items and effectively loading half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing revoked goods every time and recently clapped rates from five to ten percent on $60 billion American goods.
Shina promised to equip the US shoot-for-shot, and the world's largest economy will not move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to give over to requests, but publicly fulfilling the US's requests will be too much of a embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China's president.
Experts still say that if Beijing plays his cards correctly, pressure on US trade war over the long term Shina can support positively by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that could start an economic twelve air in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than spectators have already known," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'remained' for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs.
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and calls for help to rebuild the land that was destroyed by war for more than seven years.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country improve.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since then the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country need Philantropical assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the flat land.
However, he emphasized that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had secured the invasion.
Europe sails Ryder Victory in Paris
Span Europe won the 2018 Ryder-Beker and won the Team U.S.A. with a final point of 16.5 at 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European ground and has not won a rider bear in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team reached the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S.-star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, made his T-hour explode in the water at the par-3 16th gate and gave his competition to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari blowed in all its rounds and became one of the 1-of-4 players ever to go 5-0-0 since then the tournament's current format started in 1979.
U.S. Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olees of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter from England who may have played in his final Ryder-beker.
A veteran of eight rider cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It had been a robbing year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He hands over the fackle to his countryman John Ram who won on Sunday US-gholfing Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his competitions in France and now has a record of 13-21-3- runway Ryder-beer record.
A strange statistics by one of the biggest players of all times and he won 14 big titles second to just Jack Nicklaus.
Span U.S. struggled all weekend to find the schoonveld with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-kaliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furik spoke to a disappointing performance on behalf of his team, "I am proud of these guys.
There was some time this morning when we sat a little heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Hut off for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 of his players have played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America, and our Ryder-beer coma, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You need to keep your hat sharp.
We're superior."
