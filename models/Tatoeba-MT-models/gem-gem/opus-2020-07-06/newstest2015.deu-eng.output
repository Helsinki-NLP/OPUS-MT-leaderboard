Police of Karratha arrests 20-year-olds after fast motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was conveyed after the driver had driven it with 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Transport police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle today after they had noticed it as it left a tank station on the Bathdate Road with 125 km/h.
The police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued to drive on the Burgess Road before he went down to the Buschland, where the officials lost it from the eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person matching the description of the driver was later seen at a house in the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accuses a 20-year-old man of non-observing a stop signal as well as unrespectful driving.
He should appear in Karratha in the court of office on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and conveyed for three months.

George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at the Scotland Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, slept, and couldn't signal an agreement."
Webster is also proposed to rape a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish Highland on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiating date for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Recovery of the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The Congress Members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil rights.
"As unions die, the middle class jobs also die," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and Vice-President of Progressive Caucus at the Congress.
That is why I proudly propose the law of employee empowerment, together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This breaching law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination due to the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops anti-business forces.
The supplementation of the national labour law law to create an opportunity for discriminatory workers to organise a trade union representative in order to complain before a civil court for justice - and to obtain damage or penalties - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal suggest, is to get back to a very American idea.
Despite the relapses that the trade unions have been exposed to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and maintain labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, press freedom and association law in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a Constitution to ensure that the military autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full consciousness of the fact that workers and their trade unions took part in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "workers' rights are guaranteed for association and joint negotiations and trade."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In acknowledging the fact that the workers would have to organise and to raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans entered a clause which explicitly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to secure and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and every profession or business.
Agreements restricting this right or aiming to reduce it are zero and void; measures aimed at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Human Rights Commission, of which the General Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors made a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect his interests or to join them."
Since generations, Americans have accepted the basic premises that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to establish a trade unions - and that this trade union should then be protected in collective negotiations as equivalent partners with companies and government agencies.
After these rights in America have been subsidied, it is indeed very wise to reconsiderate the American ideal, as a result that the working population must have the right to unite themselves and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the worker movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By increasing the living standards of millions of people, work has created a market for industry in a wonderful way and increased the whole nation to an unpredictable level of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story keeps them.
The story remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of representatives of workers - has long been overwhelming.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have raised America in the past and solved the promise of democracy.
Judges stop temporary law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force to close
On Sunday, a U.S. Federal Judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, of which lawyers say that it had probably led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was raised by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, to the law in June and to enter into force on September 1, would force doctors who conduct abortions to acquire a patient right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the decision of the judge means that the doctors can continue to carry out promptly legal abortions while applying such a right.
"The applicants can continue to work in accordance with law while they strive to achieve these rights," wrote Bundesrichter John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing for the Judge shall be appointed in order to make a more lasting decision for the law.
Advocates of abortion welcomed the decision to receive hospitalisation rights in a number of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would spend more time.
"The today's decision means that women in Louisiana are exempting from a law that wants to take their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and chairman of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, who, on behalf of three of the five clinics of the State, accused of the law.
It was not clear whether the judgment was also extended to the doctors from the two clinics which had not joined the complaint and had also requested the right to instruction.
Louisiana is one of 11 countries which have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas, which had forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion prosecutors and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that instruction rights require unnecessary restrictions by doctors.
Abortage partners are opposed to the protection of women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient indication rights, announced the Centre for Reproduction Rights.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to avoid abortion, this doctor would no longer perform the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their arguments against the judgment, Louisiana State representatives said that they would not punish doctors for the execution of abortions while their applications for patient rights were still due.
Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to best treatment options lead to higher death rates by ovary cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put an online video homemage for their mother who died of ovary cancers in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dieing of egg ox cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data from more than 1100 Australian women in which egg stock cancer was detected in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
CLEIN STUDY: New medicines could slow down lung and egg stomach cancer
The researchers examined women's medical care over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, the type of ovary cancer, existing pre - diseases and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For elderly women and those whose cancer had been further advanced at the diagnosis time, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the State, the risk of death during the study was 20 percent higher than those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died with higher probability of ovary cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres than possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological uncologens, and they are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
In spite of improving telemedical services in order to resist distances, she proposed, as a possible remedy, a strengthening of the service of influenced doctors to allow specialists to provide women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographical status, resulted in a bad long-term survival rate in women in the ovary cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovary cancer.
Garden centers regret falling house owners numbers
The decline along with an increased decrease in the number of household owners under 35 years could result in the loss of garden centres tens of thousands of pounds per year when today’s young consumers, after a study of the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "care age group for garden products".
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with their own homes spend for their gardens.
The increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, asphalt the popular procedure to asphalt pre-gartens for parking purposes and the falling garden size are other factors threatening the industry, in which estimated £5 billion is being sold annually.
In the Great London area, where over a period of 6 years the share of household owners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest expenditure for garden products per household will be reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticulture Society indicate that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, headyard consultant for the RHS said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular in tenants because they can take their plants on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "gold age" of garden retail trade due to increasing domestic and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also forecasted a improved market situation for this year due to better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement referred to by opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergy Tahirul Qadri in Pakistan continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1,000 demonstrators stumbled the state TV TV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The sender launched his operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends it back.
At the same time, about 3,000 demonstrators tried to come to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a mile away, they delivered collapses with security forces with stains and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's withdrawal, but he rejected that.
The army of the country therefore urges a political solution to the conflict, "with no time to waste and use without violence".
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been more frequent.
The opposition politician Imran Khan suggests Prime Minister Sharif to have deceived his election in May last year.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to move to Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey subscribes to the US diplomat for spy report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has subscribed to the most service-old US diplomats of the country to information on a report on American and British spying in Turkey.
Vice-President Bülent said that the U.S. messenger and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine The Mirror as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, shows that Turkey was a main activity area for US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying out each other.
A previous report that also had Germany's most important secret service in the vision ensured that the Turkish Government reacted significantly more irritablely.
Warning strike: Lodge guides threaten with consequences for pendler
On Monday evening, the bottom-wide warning strike of the closure leader could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The expiry announced for 18 to 21 o'clock all transport companies, including remote, regional and S-Bahn transport,
The main direction of the warning strike is the traffic of goods.

said the District Chairman of the German Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitt, in Düsseldorf.
We're expecting significant losses.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is the traffic of goods.
The German railway in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where they wanted to strike, so it was difficult to see the consequences in advance.
Police Head of Magaluf of Corruption accused
On Friday, the prosecutor of Mallorca's State Attorney submitted evidence of persecution by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
The head of the police of Calvià on the Mallorca holiday island was arrested by businessmen and bar owners in the famous Binge Drinking Hotspot Magaluf.
Head of Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was inspected by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most bars and night clubs are located in Magaluf.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors submitted proofs on Friday to the Office of the State Advocate for Corruption against Mallorcas by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with corruption proposals and are consulted by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the indignant night club owners claimed that the government's bankruptcy had serious effects on their businesses.
"It's no longer about earning money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our base of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines in this summer due to a viral YouTube video, in which a 18-year-old British tourist was shown, who completed 24 men during a saftour Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholic holidayrs in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the robbed alcoholic knee tours.
The Playhouse Club, in which the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for one year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour Organizationator Carnage together have to pay a penalty of 55.000 € (73,000 $).
The tourist location of Magaluf, which is popular especially for young British holidays, is also known for several accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of the "Balconing", where people jump from one balcony to the other or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRÜHLING has made South Australia a winter surprise, with strong spectaculars and strong winds that affected the flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21 o'clock, another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had fallen down to Sunday in the night.
The last defeat was the result of a series of short, stormy sculptors, including a guss that started just before 20 o'clock and provided almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week provided a early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city fell again to a maximum of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The low weather conditions have probably led to the delayed landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19.30 p.m. but was hit by a wind wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
At that time windsets reached about 50 km/h on the ground on Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to start on a second landing flight and finally set up at about 20.40 p.m.
The delay led to a delay in some other flights, including an emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is predicted on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: Highest time for large networking
In view of the galopping technical progress that threatens to transform our pleasant home to high-tech scalp centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessories.
While I write this, my look at the spiral cable that connects the hearer to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a thought behind: if the cable wasn't, in the shortest time all the hearers would fly no more gentle in the house, and that would be much more retro.
Absolutely, is it applicable to the eceltronic (ekeltronic?
No, typing error: electronic sector the rule that the world's newness is today the electric scrap from tomorrow, purchased - unprecedented.
And for example, who still has a tube television in the living room today, who simply says that he's noting television in principle.
Why are these considerations?
Because the pressing of the Ifa on the radio tower this week brings us back our absolute incompetence in electronic issues.
The laye, who has been blindly dominated by the washing machine and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are distributed with unfairly obscene expert speech before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should we talk about to people who seem to spread such a quarter voluntarily?
In general, for about 20 years, it has been particularly important for us to connect our house as well.
So that the yoghurt will rebuild himself so that the brand reporter can tell us on the Maldives on vacation that it burns gradually in the working room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we from the office from air conditioning at our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly be true in the nearest: We lift up our bracelet clock, you say, "Sauga!" - and at home the dust-saugroboter runs.
Irre.
Everything goes on nothing less than a revolution: "The limits between white and brown product swim", a branch coins, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam garer sends the weather report and the data glass shows how long the pizza needs in the oven, but what does not help because we are in the dust.
We also know from daily practice: If a new-modic device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed empty.
What another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israel's children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after they had spent the summer in air protection rooms, while rocket and murder shots on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and the schools remained closed in Gaza, while the area recovered from the battles.
The start of school brought the communities drawn by Raketen in the south of Israel a feeling of joy and expectation, but the signs of the fight are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" children's garden, hit by a rocket, before entering the students' granate splitters from the walls and ski walls.
"We are a little scared, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children from our area need urgently to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little funny" to go back to school suddenly.
"There were difficult times, and we haven't gone out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border of Gaza to offer his support.
Until the war broke up last week, thousands of people of border communities like seed remained in their houses or left their houses to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and to escape the rocket and murder fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border of Gaza, where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortargranate, still hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education announced that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were preliminaryly attended in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town of Gaza, which is severely drawn by the Palestinian gun.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, "We will ensure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited stand of weapons on the last Tuesday.
The rest of the arms provided an immediate end of the fight, but important problems remain unsolved, like the demand of Hamas after a suspension of the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel demands a disarmament of the Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fights.
A new round of indirect discussions is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to the estimates of the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel objects to these information and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence for this information.
On Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai workers, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4.591 missiles and mortargranates in Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza region and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into preliminary protection rooms.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective areas and continue to fight, the educational authorities moved last week the beginning of the school year.
"I hope the school will be opened again soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who is currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl questions NPD bans
In view of the loss of votes by the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl spoke for an end of the current NPD prohibition procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibitions against the NPD should be terminated before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts down worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU head in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipzig Volkszeitung".
This is a joyful development in the right direction and a development which makes me more likely to have a political fight against the NPD and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed at the vote on Sunday at the Five Percent Horde.
A first approach to the prohibition of the legally-extremated party was failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection at that time also had in the NPD-spitze informants.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new request to Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
On the new country place refugees are now placed in tents.
The central first recording for refugees in Harburg is located from all sides.
Now the interior authority has been able to set up three tents of the Red Cross.
The district politicians were only briefly informed before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to retain the reserves of the citizens and give the district politicians no opportunity to contribute constructively to the human accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group chairman of the Greens in the Harburg District Assembly.
Their party demands that the district administration of Harburg provide unused houses for accommodation at the moment.
96 refugees can be placed in the three tents.
Reasons for overfilling in the first intake are the storm of seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter increase in seven years, showing a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
As a result, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, announced that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
RP Data figures show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 per cent last year, on the other hand in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by average by five and six percent.
On the other end of the scale, Canberra, which was severely hit by the cuts in government expenditure and where prices increased only by 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless continued that with the beginning of the spring, an increase would now be observed for the next months in the real estates standing for sale, which would undergo the market "a real test".
"If you consider the constantly high rate of auction prices, a general fast sales rate and the continuing low interest environment, it is likely that the domestic prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of the manager Peer Medau and certifies it to pose "as a fieldman".
The state of the university is not this, says the Communication.
The Medau family had already been informed in mid-June on the matter of the university.
The statement that the plans were first known in July is definitely wrong," said Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans are not "consumptions or even decisions", but there would be "preferencies".
The development of the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than the Medaus fears.
From a nine meters wide street was and is not the talk.
It is about 5.50 meters, which is one meter wide than before," explains Pötzl.
The Medau operators' argument that their free and schooly parking areas will then only be used by students of the university in the future will not allow Pötzl to apply.
Zugeparkt is not at all because it is now smartly solved as with other public parking.
Think of the Inhabitants
According to the university president, the children's sculpture mountainwichtel, which is located on the ground and which would lead to the entrance to the park deck, is "not to be affected".
Rather, he has to bear in mind, "that this is not only about the children's scripts, but also about the residents at the advertisement to the Friedrich-Streib Street and the 800 students of the neighbouring real school.
So this is much more than the particular interests of Mr Medau", says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parental board of the children's scripts, with the expansion of the street, would be entitled "to lose a few naturally left coburg's spots" to "can the readers themselves decide".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Building Office Bamberg, wants to inform the Councils on the constructional development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new conclusion".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the children's scripts last week about the plans of the university.
Thus, the access to the new parking deck is not to lead over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib Street, but to the Medau Mountain.
Thus, the narrow road had to be expanded to about a mile of two-scale length.
According to the Medaus high bills, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would diverge.
Of about 2000 vehicles every day, it is spoken.
From the sides of the city, the project has not yet been spoken.
Glandorf returns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt brought particular health problems to this decision.
The decision has not been easy for me, it has been matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the National Team," the 2007 World Championship informed on his Facebook page.
He therefore has a balance of 167 country games and 576 gates for Germany in international retirement.
Because the vibrant backspace player for the Champions-League winner from Flensburg still wants to go to Torejagd for a few years, he is no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelandic country, which announces its border on Tuesday for the country games against Switzerland, Glandorf conducted a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have enthusiasmed me as well as they will enthusiasm my long-term companions and followers.
But I would like to be healthy for my club in the next few years, for which longer regeneration breaks are needed which do not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to fear his career end in 2012 after a fersen infection.
Due to across problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball League (DHB) with a cortison syringe that had later caused a strong inflammation.
An emergency surgery and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team physician, which ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career passes not to any body spurlessly.
I have some health buildings that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infectious foot surgerys that took place in a short distance in 2012, I never got my blood pressure correctly handled.
There are some other confusion-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I have noticed that although I can't control my head, I can't deceive my body," explained Glandorf in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be ready for a comeback in the absolute emergency.
"When all the stripes are ripped, I'm always ready to talk," explained the two-fold family father to the specialist magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have become quite humble about my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least somewhat straight.
In addition to the 2007 WM title and the profit of the Champions League 2014, he picked up the EHF pokal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, Flensburg also secured the Europepokal of the Pokalsieger.
German economy shrinked by 0.2 percent in spring
The crisis around the globe brake the German economy in the second quarter.
The gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 per cent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This announced the Statistical Federal Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
In the consumption alone, the economy lived in the spring, while investments decreased.
External trade also inhibited the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual record, for the first half of the year a total GDP rate of 0.8 per cent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "Münsterland-Mooist", which led the Burgmanns City for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmann City of Horstmar experienced a invasion of Dutch "fiets drivers" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Moost".
It is the largest bike tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants thanked Jos ter Huern for the organisation of this trip through the Münsterland.
Posted in various specialist magazines, this tour was offered to interested people.
We're from The Helder and we're going overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland even in this way," the cyclists were pleased to see the route through the circles of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration at the Vereinheim der Schützenbroderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "Friedensturn" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
The route, which was written for three different categories, led back towards Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and over Havixbeck and Picturebeck to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 height meters, 120 kilometres with 1475 height meters and 145 kilometres with 1775 height meters, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were retired on their way in Havixbeck and pictures.
The chief organiser Jos ter Huerne and Mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this bicycle sport event.
We are satisfied and it was a beautiful experience for all stakeholders.
The organization left without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive factor of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably on the bad weather forecasts and in the morning rain.
"We will see ourselves again in 2015 at hopingly beautiful weather on 30 August or during another weekend," however, the bicycle drivers promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new post.
Constantin Weckers Honest Memoires
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Constantine Wecker, Songmaker, Pacifist, Politesure Activist, Ex-Heftling, brought on 287 pages in "Munch and Warrior".
Not chronological, but more thoughtfetches for thoughtfetches, the coins born on June 1, 1947 wrote down their memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable song text.
And he is honest in this matter: from the onanie as a gymnasiast to the shop thief and drug consumption, he does not exert any human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also takes abstract, but the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in now, spirituality - all that he tries to go to the ground, in very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pazifism, his society’s criticism, his political commitment - and also, as he has not only influenced the music (the opera lover became a Soul and Rock musician), but also his captivity.
Lastly, the Lebemann Constantin Wecker also brought closer to the ascetic monk, which is "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything unnecessary".
There are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the high-good views: for example about slaughterries in a locally frequented by GIs or a weird car ride where he showed frontal a tree.
He's honest, too.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into my arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry trys for a coma, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with vibrant melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moods.
He visited "many" therapy after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just stopped his voice, "Hold up with the crack.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to see Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - went to the knee with him and talked about things like the form of beer glass or the beauty of a cricket hit.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner that read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a poetry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at his father's times, he won an insight into how life would have been for him.
It's a little lighter now, but they're dark, robbed, deep shy labyrinthe with flames and smoke and a lot of rose.
My father just sat down in the whale earlier, and then he could be heard slowly how he started singing because he could wash the poultry from himself.
When I ran around there, I realized that he had done this for years to put the food on the table, and my respect for him became greater.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents’ beliefs.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother went bad at the end of her life, we began to "I love you, I love you, I love you" to say.
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.
Can you stop that "I love you"?
Stop arming me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still a friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I pulled through this fitnessing and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's hard.
Nobody likes to eat Karotten.
Henry's career change may appear in his elegant, short-cut bart.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he was taken by the theatre.
It followed the coma of the mistakes, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and comodies that have filled his business life.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black immitator/Comedian on television for a pretty long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow up not only in the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke story machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the stage right at the Black and White Minimumrel show, a light entertainment program in which people were "slack painting," Henry launched his comedy there over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish it would never have happened, but I don't regret that I did it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of price-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "great parodie of black people."
By introducing figures that were ridiculating and celebrated by the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on a mission in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as the chief of the kitchen Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chief!.
Advertisements, documentary films, TV series and film roles featured his next decade, but after his BBC series, LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels like you're just bringing the time around or going a little on the spot?"
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first result was Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was really allergic.
I had never learned anything right about him at school and mostly thought he was a domain of the middle class, whites in trumpets and a coal head in front of it.
So I was very scared of that.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't hurt if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry introduced 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I felt I could do this.
It was almost like someone finally put my head right on me.
"Then it's all right, it's a serious thing, take them seriously, learn your text, investigate a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he came up in the coma of mistakes.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to talk to the audience.
"A little voice told me, "You have to break over 10 minutes while they repair the computer."
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences is Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tenses.
That also came well, so it's like a big sign of the gods who tells me "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERN voice.
So I'll stay there.
I really love this.
I love being in a sample room.
Henry, however, still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been through humorous outbreaks, while he repeatedly imitate people.
I decided not to make stand-up-comedy because I think this kind of immediate satisfaction by a room full of strangers is somewhat dangerous.
If you're always looking for this, you're going in front of a wall.
I sometimes get live in Apollo if I want to do so, but in total I don't have as much as before.
I'm asking him if he'll ever make a stand-up comedytour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a start, a medium part and the end of a trip - I don't think I'd ever want to give up this again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I'd like to be a actor.
It's funny.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi Rebells block streets in Jemens capital
In the conflict between Shihi Huthi rebels and the Jemenite Government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in Sanaa's capital.
Huthi trailers had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
Access to Parliament had also been blocked.
Yemenite media report on a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online release of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi was threatened by further escalation of the conflict, according to the journal, not to meet its demands.
The Shibian Huthis fight for more independence from Sunnitly ruled Yemen and demand the resignation of the government.
The people's tribe of the Huthi has been defeating the Jemenite capital for almost two weeks.
About 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large access routes of Sanaa.
There are repeatedly bloody fights with the Jemenite army around the country.
Kenia registered officials in order to impose "geist employers"
Kenia has started registering biometricly all state officials to remove "geist staff" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer pay, were a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments even after their dismissal from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service at his entry in 2013.
A test at the beginning of this year found that at least 1 million dollars (700,000 £) per month were lost in payments for "geist workers" and other abused financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person died or leaves public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data on biometric registry is recorded in a government message.
All who did not do this without a credible excuse were removed from the salary list continued.
"By this process, it is essential to contribute to rationalising the public service by detecting the actual number of officials and reconciling the salary list at both levels of government - so the "geist workers" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinett Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal around the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be negotiated in court for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi-Grunder Theo Albrecht, demand 19.4 million euros of Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil process at the Düsseldorfer Landgericht.
This was notified by a court speaker on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach has betrayed the purchase of artworks and old hours and Berthold Albrecht has calculated higher purchase prices than actually paid.
This would also make the agreed provision higher.
Achenbach bought value items for albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was 44 years old in school, 23 of which as a school leader.
From this time, Manfred Richter knows many Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his striving to see people in the student.
The snowheads are the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountain.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordböhmen, today Trutnov.
After four years of high school, he was interested in the school of teachers.
A year later the Sudeten Germans were dismissed.
Within a half hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 in the goods wagon.
Thus, judges went into the Upper France Senkendorf.
The teacher education took place in Bamberg.
For this purpose, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometres a week to the next train station with the train to Bamberg, three kilometres across the city to school and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleeping place in a red-creuz home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a bedroom.
In 1951 he made the first and in 1954 after three years of teaching office attorney the second graduate.
Since he had no free teacher office for him, he worked to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "Fräulein Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he attended a three-room apartment in the newly built teacher house next to school.
This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
So far there were three classes in Kollbach at the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69, they were summarized in Petershausen in the present city hall.
When the school association was founded in Indersdorf, only the primary school remained in the place.
In order to avoid a reclassification in the smaller school, then the director Georg Sigl switched to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, so the children and their teachers were able to relate from September 1982 to today's construction, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who also made a workroom and the extension of the 1997 basement room, although this was not eligible for school buildings.
"Burgermaster Götz was very friendly," judges thankful remembered.
During his entire career, Manfred Judge never forgot the speech of a government representative who had answered a lecture of a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love." Manfred Judges put out what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "This does not always work." Whether he only meant his students or equally his own six children, it is not quite clear.
In any case, Richters Tun was sometimes unconventional.
When pupils cried, they did not get a criminal work from him, nor were they distorted for aftersitting.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had made two pairs of box handshoes and let the two counterparts come against each other, even if there should be a veil.
To the benefit of the school, judges as a director held a good relationship with then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
It moved the partyless judge after his retirement to candidifier at least as last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
But judges were elected in place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicycle drivers are located in the Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and Scotland intermediate stops
When bicycles make bargains on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scotlands, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of racing impressed only: The 700 participants of the Mr4-Radtour as well as the accompanying tross enjoyed a break in the lower curpark of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Speeding and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and had a concert of Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, 60 kilometres from Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who was started with the bicycle in Bad Vilbel, and the director of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For the refreshment of body and spirit, all kinds of good things were prepared: The landwifes from Ranstadt and Lower-Mockstadt had backed 85 leaks of apples, twins, struggles and cheese, which wonderfully folded to the decent cyclists.
"Such cakes can only bake farmers," a participant from Aulendiebach complimented while ordering another piece.
In the drinking state of the tournament Geiß-Nidda, cold refreshments could be experienced.
The "Duo Bravo" interviewed the visitors with well-known melodies from opera and musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, finally he has reconsolidated already run-off bicycle chains today."
Consequently, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed at the well before the Trinkkurhaus of Reporter Rainer Janke and used the opportunity to advertise the radio for salthouses.
Professor Tobias Hagen also, since the first Mr4 tour in 2004 as a tour leader, was able to cut short, yet he had a lot to do with the technology on the spot.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated, wrote Facebook entries, and made reports with his employees and the 15-headed motorcycle booth of the police Hessen, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulla, from Lauterbach or the Taunus, and even from numerous cities in Westfalen, bicycle drivers are resisted.
The number of participants is a bit based on the overnight capacity available.
In category I, the participants are located in hotels, in category II in collecting accommodations.
The wheelers had a good impression from the curriculum when they broke up after a half hours again: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" They whip to the departure.
After arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to set a short break.
But in the evening, the wheels were required in the idyllic Oldburg Park.
Under the regime of the Schotten Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS) the park had received a beautiful festival environment and of course were delicious eggs prepared, such as flame cakes with well-cooled feather whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS business leader Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his role as board member of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen, welcomed the visitors.
The three were clearly happy about the "much operation in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance bean.
Despite the sports activity on the bicycle, the opportunity to move swiftly under the free sky was eagerly used.
Among the guests there were increasingly citizens who were as dressed by the good mood as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb – including a concert with the trencowlers – were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of bicycles, the athletes returned to Bad Vilbel.
Thousands of Turkish policemen arrested against the government because of "conspiracy"
A total of 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey due to the suspicion of "consumption against the government", local media agencies report.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level policemen, reported Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government staff, including four government ministers last December.
In July a number of Turkish policemen were arrested because they claimed to have founded an organized criminal association and picked up telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (which was then Prime Minister) described her approach as part of the activities of the Islamic clergyman Fethulla Güllen against him and others in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he announced waiting journalists that not all schools had opened again, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The celebrations of September were not held at every school.
Heaven is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We have to fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, head of school in Slavian, the daughter of Jazenjuk, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here and that the children will receive a education that will be useful for them in the next life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, while the children wear dressed shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud glory leap from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career started at the world management company Bain and Co., which changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and returned when Pearson's mother company's top posts went to a younger male colleague.
Their absorption was supposed to be nearly 1 million £.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when he sought more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became the consultant of the cabinet.
Your husband is a former tory Council member.
Already in May, I described the chairman's task with a poisoned belly.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inside the first garde of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and distress when things go wrong.
This ensures a almost indispensable duopol, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But the new president would risk getting into action, putting up everything and taking up an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might take himself to his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if it was not enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtaken.
While competition is getting closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable security, the upcoming negotiation of licence fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 per year, the British public buys into the world's largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 Pence per day.
And it seems that the BBC rises upwards on the popularity scale: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The sights and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get messages on my cell phone today and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very dear and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable president - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that decreasing Tweet was not authorized
A second of the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a decreasing comment on the democratic state lawyer, who is central to a criminal charge against him because of the abuse of the authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's user account that deprived the previous.
A Tweet has just been sent from my account which was not authorized by me.
"I didn't accept the Tweet and have deleted it," said the later message.
Perry's employees did not answer instantly to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unprecedented picture of the district lawyer of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced on tax in April 2013 for drinking.
Perry introduced a veto against a financial support for her office when she refused to withdraw, which would lead to an accusation against Perry - which might be a presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the Tweets says: "I don't always drive drunk with the three-fold allowed alcohol level ... but if I do, I complain to governor Perry when he puts it out."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not responsible for the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special state lawyer from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded for not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal aids applied to the judge in charge of the case to reject the accusation and argued that the law against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffus.
Perry stopped 7.5 million dollars of government money to the public Integrity Unit of the State - which is resident in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to withdraw.
This veto provided a public complaint from a left-hand watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After he had completed the election meetings in Iowa in 2012 during his presidential candidateship, Perry entered speculations that he would stop by posting a twot of a photo of himself when jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains the housing market again for "normal"
One of the most prominent construction operators in London pointed out that the housing market in the southeast of England was back to a normal level.
Homes in the capital were hotly desired and had enormous price increases, which led the Bank of England to put upper limits on hypotheses in June due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "The market has returned to normal transaction levels since the maximum level of 2013 since the beginning of the current financial year" and added that this has offered a "stable action environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the departure, as foreign buyers drew into the capital.
According to information from the Cataster Office, prices in the city area alone increased by 18.5 percent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average sales prices for Berkeley's private, price-value and student offers rose by about a fifth last year and were at the end of April by £423.000.
In recent months, however, a stronger pound has made real estate property in London less attractive for foreign buyers - some of them have also been disappointed by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric by the introduction of a possible "million tax" before the general elections in the coming May.
The London Real Estate Maker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which stronger credit supply schemes were presented, would also lead to lower market growth during the second half of the year, both in real estate sales and in prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decrease in the mortgage permit in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its predictions for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 to 3 percent, based on a already weakening home price consciousness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now decreased by a quarter of a year, according to Makler WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital of Berkeley is a blessing, as the due amounts for date sales amount to more than 2.2 billion £.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and the result remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost one third more than the maximum level in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result increased by 40 per cent to £280 million each year, the turnover by £18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the Annual Assembly of the Company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenues for Berkeley were expected to correspond to the current market expectations in the current year.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to £450 million.
Berkeley-Acts were firm in London's trade in the afternoon at £23.96.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appears at the 85th Oscar rental.
Naked photos of the Oscar prizemaker Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "masterlist" of more 100 starlets pictures.
A representative of the Star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained to the hacker for "eclant violation of privacy".
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who forward the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the Photo Sharing Page 4chan were said to be created by a gap in the online storage system iCloud by Apple. The supposed "masterlist" of the hacking victim includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Cate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" on Twitter also condemned the hack.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have taken in our house's private environment years ago - I hope you are so very satisfied with you," wrote Winstead on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" contradicts that the photos are about pictures of her and twoteen "These so-called naked images of me are GEFELD, people.
Let's fight the beginning. *Word game intends to*.
Buzzfeed reported on late Sunday that a speaker of the Popstar Ariana Grande abstained from her the authenticity of the supposed photos.
Exclusive withdrawal from Howard Jacobson's high-level new novel about love and the letters "J".
They broke, so you could best describe it, they slowly resolved like a carton that you left in the rain.
Uncommonly a woman told him he was too serious, hard, intense, distant, and perhaps somewhat scratchy.
And then shake him his hand.
He knew Kratzbürstig.
He was stupid, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stupidness was a just starting affair, which was more promising for a relief of the lonely slowness of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even had brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a crawling delicate beauty with countless hairs and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more distant and raw than the port of Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion, Kevern thought of her aunt, who had inherited a property in a moist but paradise valley with the touching name Paradise Valley.
Over several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were delicious, the baths were still spiders, naked sniffs had left their traces on all windows and believed that they belonged to all this, and the garden was overwhelmed with uncrude that looked like giant cupheads.
It was like the house of a child marble, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the Longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the next week.
Kevern had been sitting with Ailinn on the broken stalls in the high grass and enjoyed an unusual warm spring afternoon. Both had climbed down to the service console, which provided the country with calm music and vulnerable news, when the sight of their crushed brown legs remembered him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, which his father had loved to listen to with closed roll shops in the house.
Your feet are too large.
Due to their unruly aggressivity, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was so correctly forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolated, as the word obsolesses.
The general taste created what was never accomplished with the adoption and regulations, and how people in books choose the From-Teller-washer-to-Millionary Memoires, Cooking Books and Love-Romans, so they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a grob-comic serenade of Ailinn's great feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song of a Jazz Pianist named Fats Waller," he told her and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That's what his father had always done to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still young.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers on your lips, it's gonna cost you a penny.
It hadn't been a very funny game at that time, and it wasn't very funny now.
He knew that he expected this, that's all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any.
Jazz wasn't played even if he wasn't directly forbidden.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only room for one "if" in life.
At the beginning of a melodie, people wanted to be sure where it would end.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had become 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz from his father's half secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
In her age, she probably didn't remember a time when pop singer wasn't black.
Again, there were no laws or forces.
A consistent society meant that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of grouping - thankful as those of fate.
People with Afro-Caribian origin were suitable for entertainment and sport by temperament and body construction, so singing and running.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent from nature and were served with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the channelization; what was left of the Greeks, the Teller broke.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents had not forgotten to leave the country as WAR WAR WHEN WAR, WHEN THE WORK WAS happened - out of fear of being accused of fire, even of fear that the flames would consume them as the next - had opened Labneh and Shisha pipe restaurants, thought and became depressive with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his skills.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung her could ever be shown.
Music was expression of love.
"They are not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too large.
My father never offended someone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceitful feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound damping of the giant coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father have loved that kind of thing?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips in her presence.
She thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head unfaithful and locked Kevern's sight.
There was nothing else to see all over the world than her uncovered black hair.
There was nothing else he would've wanted to see.
"If you say it," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing for me.
They seemed really worried.
Is my feet too large?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't like that.
Maybe your jackets, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my boys are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for it.
"Your thick bowls are exactly the reason why you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he was often in trouble because, like his father, he did not have the reassuring charm that was needed to tell the greedyness in witches.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to be that, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons became red, and lifted up from her chair, threw the console, and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Holunderbloom wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to scream like Palmwedel in the storm.
"And your thickhead is exactly the reason why I feel perverse to you," she said...
Except I'm not at all.
She saddled him, both because of the unnecessary inappropriateness of his words and the fear in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd hit her?
She hadn't told him about life on the cold North Archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same giant and ice cold ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confusioned men, with even thick skin and more treacherous according to DEM WAS WAS WAS WAS WAS WAS THEIR ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from kneep to Kneipe, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or slaughtered them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn't watch!
She first knocked - Knutschen was the most common word for a erotic attraction between men and women, a antidote to the nonsensive love balls from the console - first knock them and then hit them.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary penetration, as the knots itself already represented a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign through her body to walk.
He raised himself out of the lying chair like an old man.
She also felt bleeding, but the wake of his mourning surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
You didn't know.
She looked at him as he was away - as from a room on the upper floor her companion watched him - a man complaining about something he had sworn himself.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised her hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowled his back, shamed, conquered without a struggle spirit - why was this a sight she seemed well to know if she could not remember once she had seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomon looked at her feet.
Several years before the just reported events, Esme Nussbaum, a intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher in charge of Ofnow, the non-legislative public mood surveillance body, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at a low and medium level in exactly the land parts where their reduction, if not abolition, would be expected, in view of the money and energy invested in the elimination of this violence.
"It has already been done much, and much has to be done," she wrote, "to make the inborn aggressiveness of a people, which led thousands of wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness was rarely seen historically despite the highly demanding church towers between the hills.
But some of the qualities are unextinent.
The higher the church tower, the smaller the passion he continues to wake.
The population crys when hearing sentimental ballads, touches on stories about overwhelmed difficulties and claims to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the former rawness keeps rural communities as well as our urban fields firmly, but there is also evidence of the existence of a new and retaining strife at home, at the workplace, on the streets and even on the fields of play.
"You have an unhappy tendency to overdrive," said her Mentor when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less romans.
Esme Nussbaum cut her head.
I have to ask you, are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme relied on her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
The feminist?
Quiet again.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "being against atheism, lesbians or feminism.
This is a non-profit job.
We serve a non-profit society.
However, certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy in itself may sometimes distort results as you have suggested them.
You have obviously prejudices against the church, and these things that you call "conservative" and "roh" could be interpreted by others as well as expressions of natural force and vitality.
If you continue to walk around, WHAT WHAT IS THAT WHEN IT IS WHEN IT IS, as if it would have happened yesterday, means taking the country its essential power of life.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED writing in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarters of centuries or longer.
Smile to her neighbors, appreciate her partner, hear Balladen, visit musicals, use her phone, talk, explain, listen to, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the singing word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want to go on," Esme Nussbaum answered with a quiet voice when she was sure that her boss had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effectively healed as we pretend ourselves.
My concern is that without warning, we may repeat how we repeat the mistakes that were only the first to DEM WHAT WHEN THE CHILD WHEN WHEN WAS THE CHILD.
This time, however, it is not the others that we leave our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid with his hands.
To imply an English patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you describe actions as "fellows" that our grandparents may or not have committed.
They also go too far if you talk that these would have left their "woud" and their "mistrue" on "other".
It should not actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past as to protect the present, we speak of "our" and "other".
There was no "we" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From who, if we are honestly to ourselves," Esme dared, "no part of the society can claim to have done well.
I'm not complaining to anyone.
Whether it has been done bad or good what has happened has happened.
That was then.
There is no need to be said anything more - that's where we agree.
And just as no guilt has to be allocated, it does not need to be excluded if such a eradication would be appropriate and if there would be a way to get it.
But what does the past serve if we do not learn from it--
The past helps us to forget it.
If I can say something about that...
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramids collapsed.
"I will think of her report," he said and dismissed her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorbike driver who, as passengers described, had driven on the footway in a kind of "brutal anger".
There are accidents.
Lesotho Military Member says that no State strike is planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Lesotho disagreed that they had planned a state war to destroy the government and said they were going against police officers to whom the army of political fanatics was proposed.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled out of the country and announced that the army of the country surrounded his office and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The Prime Minister brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after reporting about Attentats threats.
Military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that the de facto there is no state war, but the military reacts to the threat of "political fanatics" whose army was ahead of the police.
"What happened this morning that the staff of the Defense Forces of Lesotho acted after receiving several secret service reports that within the police some elements acting, which actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics, who were shortly in front of harmful damage," he said to Voice of America.
The South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military action made the impression of a confusion.
"Although nobody has claimed to have struck the government by violence, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces have so far shown signs of a state war," he said.
Speakers of the military of Lesotho announced on Sunday that the soldiers went back into their casernes and the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Vice-President Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government leadership during the absence of Thabane.
Thabane announced that he believed that he had become a target disc because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho there have been great tensions since June, after Thabane had postponed parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his unitary government.
He said that his actions had not undermined the government, otherwise loud accusations to the despite.
Production in the euro area at a 13-month level
In August, the increase in production in the euro area slowed down to the lowest point in the last 13 months, so a closely observed study.
The final market for purchase manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication above 50 specifies an extension.
New orders went back, and factories experienced breakdowns in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia across Ukraine.
The figures shall enter on Thursday before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting.
The markets expect a clear plan for the operation of the euro area and for the threatening deflation at a inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the Governor of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information during this week on whether it considers a quantitative facilitation for the euro area, in accordance with those made by the UK and the USA during the financial crisis.
"Even though a small growth is better than no growth, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more evident to the manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at the market.
The PMI factory for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains anxiety child, as well as the decline in Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are no longer reassuring," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to cut the fire of the analysts that expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI grew to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economy Expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say for the purchase manager index of the production industry in the euro area of August is that the sector will continue to grow."
He added: "Producers in the euro area seem to find life very difficult at the moment, since the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably leads to a delay or even cancellation of some contracts, especially large orders.
He said that it would be more likely that the ECB would finally have to introduce a kind of QE, "even though we suspect that this will be limited."
The decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible camping of the school, as the kids who are trapped in it are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people of Czech militia were taken as hostages in a school in Beslan in Southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrium that the world shocked.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had lost the death of the horror in the classroom.
Just a decade after the terrible camp of Beslan school, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors last night warned about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists took and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed to be the badest of the wicked.
The tragedy united the West and the East into awe, and then surprisingly transformed into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst distress.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the horror in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of these terrorist hells will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that the Ukraine is now visiting - and in the children like they die - is now going to end.
The girl who was photographed during the experiment to climb back to the broken school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when only she tried to climb back to the broken school sports hall after a mine had exploded.
Almost confused Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me I should run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida then.
My legs were bloody.
I stood up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to security.
After a number of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but yesterday said: "The pain returned three months ago.
I'm afraid I have to be operated again.
Some granate splitters are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people how she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says floating.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my study and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the camping will always remain part of her, although the memory will be slightly weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me online, how I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to not doing so again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (Runs go to school with seven years) and survived the three-day camp in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old he said, "Mama told me to lay down when there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Keep."
Full of fear that they could be dead, he fled, and saw on the way a crying little son, grabbed it at the hand, and fled through a ball hail.
His father, Vladimir, who closed his son out of his arms, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was stolpered out and with leg injuries in the hospital, on the other hand in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later fled to London (from the news news of the World that was now dissolved), to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop the memorial," he said yesterday.
But I can say that in my memory it's getting lighter.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right afterwards.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid of going back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids with whom I played in the courtyard and who didn't get it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my journey to London, especially the game store, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a top open car.
But now he is afraid of location like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamity that he and his friends suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, who worked as volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me next year at the School of Education.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the camp, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months.
She still remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London wept when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was thankful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years ago, but I still remember meeting me and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and call them all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with cellners in a restaurant. Damir shot on her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: "I always think this world has not improved in these ten years.
In Ukraine the war continues now, and people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and are still killed.
That's exactly the kind of kids like ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he's not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he does not seek revenge; he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know he doesn't like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the sports hall and inflamme there candles.
When he was smaller, he suffered below - I remember how he sometimes lay on the sofa, turning the face off of us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember how he was throwing all his weapons and other military toys away. Damir is now 17, bigger than I am, well-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came on my legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with body parts around everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy couldn't have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I left him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure that he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And that's the way life goes on to us, different from many others.
Georgia Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible picture after the camp became the symbol of the horror of Beslan
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the camp 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life, while Czech terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the Barbarei of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had set him up for his first school day before she hurried out to bring her older son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not completely alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia was able to survive.
The closer this date comes, the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been long ago, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always following me.
Nobody will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intensive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking attacks and was devastated as a statue (right).
I remember that this day Georgij wanted to go to school so much, and he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden at home in the bookline.
I understand that, but I also mean, that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this picture.
Georgia says today: "It's important that can never happen like this again.
"I doubt we've ever learned the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they investigate the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes something horrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing about such pain.
We need twenty years to forget it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the camping, but then it became better.
Later in 2004, I went back to school and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I'm always going to the sports hall when the 1st September gets closer.
I want to pay my old boyfriends a bonus.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I don't compete.
My life goes on.
I completed school this year and visit a medical university in Wladikawkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health didn't allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgia Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived even though he was captured at the feet of a murdered terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was captured to the feet of a murdered terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the camp, he was captured in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the camping.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm now older and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"I worked with psychologists in 2006, and I actually felt something better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost my consciousness.
I will never return there again and please don't ask me to show you where I've been sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the camp on the laptop
My pain is awesome and I'll bear him with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me for school.
I'm fine in my body.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the Secret Service Academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinarian Institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about it, and they should of course not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets closer.
I'll go to the celebrations for the memory.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much harder for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It stays in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that if something is so unfair.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's been operated several times, he can run, but he can't do sports.
I would say he overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always persecute us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the camp, and this only strengthens my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart crys for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can't believe it.
We were once a friendly country, how can it be that we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still killed.
If we could only take all these rebels and throw out - as far away as possible.

The baby, which was carried in security by a special operation command
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is brought to security by a Russian special intervention command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelnesses at all
The world held the breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their greedyness, their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar returned to the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous mixture.
Her father Ruslan has married again since then and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana that he called Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the camping and has grown up to a intelligent and happy girl, says neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a phantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
They'll understand why.
Man accused of overturning girls on walking in Fife
A 78-year-old man stands before court because of the surgeon of a three-year-old girl on a walking road in Fife.

The charge indicates that Mr Steward has controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, rejects the accusation before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set the procedure for January.
4 Tips for better subwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both for about $300.
I took these photos at a family festival with several cameras, which are all available at a price below $350.
Regardless of equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery square and other facks are closely closed.
Also set your camera on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scenic and recording modes that optimize the exposure time for the dummy underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check into what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Find in our shopping manager and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not work.
Point-and-Shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cameras usually not.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to look at this under water, and the correct image setting is a lucky thing.
So you're making a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a series mode with which a number of recordings are made with slightly modified exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the more you remove from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface when you make recordings in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This also allows you to bring more colour into your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is more important under water because of the bad light conditions.
It is especially important when you work with an action camera: These devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects to fill the entire image frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As a adviser of anaesthesia, he devoted his career to save the sick both the angony of the disease and the pain of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 co-worker who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors were important to diagnose and disease, while the subjects are mostly busy with something very different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulty picking myself up.
While fighting with the grip-like symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Juliet unpatic.
"I'd rather like everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusual and unreasonable.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct a röntgen test of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray investigation was found.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an unhealthy cancer that attacks the breast pan, i.e. the lungs overwhelming skin.
As with most cancer diseases, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancers have previously been smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber construction material, which once was considered to be "wonderly" but was now considered deadly.
For most of us, mesotheliom is a disease that can just as easily ignore.
Asbest is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has no longer been used in the United Kingdom since the 1960s when the industry voluntarily committed itself to no longer using it.
Even where he was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the substance - climbers, construction workers, roommates and yard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, he seems hardly to be anxious today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Great Britain, so it seems, is experienced today the peak of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths by mesoteliom here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, there are twice as many people dying from this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of Mesotheliom deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason why we now experience the fatal effects, although asbestos has been illegal for years (alone asbestos types were banned in 1999), is that a mesoteliom develops only after decades.
And the mesoteliom is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbest was, and is often still present in the houses where we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we buy.
And therefore, Mesotheliom does not know class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shopping houses in London to private schools, are not a protection room.
Parliament's buildings are asbestosproof.
In the hospitals in which we should be healthed, too, this deadly carcinogen has already been seen as a starting herd.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a clamper either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I graduated for six years." He wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and Pfortner - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many of my elderly associates will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer at least partially.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who in the last five years suffered from mesoteliom," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last one who still lives."
How many of us will still be sick?
At Andrew Lawson, mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
It was an unusual long survival.
Fifty percent of all mesotelio brands die within 8 months after the diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still be sick?"
Great Britain's leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when asbestos epidemics are expected to occur in Britain, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be killed.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like that.

A brief look at the documents of the courts to which the affected are often addressed because of damage claims, shows the extent to which the mesoteliom is already spread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen was unfortunately exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship stores in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her activity at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twenty.
"For this thing," she says, "I had never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are just a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name touches from the word "Abestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most frequently found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, tube rinsulations, boile irrigation, even for braking in cars.
It is less mortal than other asbestos forms, but the EU and WHO are still considered to be a "great health risk" with possible death.
However, more danger is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (crokydolith).
UK was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it gives clear but indirect evidence that this was a main reason for the unique high mesotheliomrates."
A member of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliom sacrifice, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her history is not unusual at all.
He presented a study of the subjects in which it is indicated that "a significant proportion of the mesotheliome without a well-known suspension by work or in the house was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like nobody can go out of being safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exposed in the heart of the government, unawarely to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the services and pipelines behind the asbestos committee rooms of Parliament were infected with asbestos, whose fatal fibers could be wrestled by something as harmless as "star air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Executive Board of Parliament's Working Service claimed that the West Minster Palace had received a "safe health certificate", it is now uncontested that 1 billion £ must be charged over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, the Members will probably meet more in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of Asbest was not maintained in accordance with the respective provisions."
Nobody can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who was never able to determine exactly the contact with Asbest is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you have worked on and the data.
What he remembers is the day beginning of December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45 years old, and he just carried out an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had castles.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought it wasn't going home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest, the skin around his lungs touched.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesoteliom.
He didn't work for a month.
Awesome doctors made röntgen records of his chest and put on Pleuratato to remove liquid from the lungs and to test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his work.
However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after sports activity and severe breathing.
In 2011 a patient had similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom.
But even now Abbott does not relate this to his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's state became worse, and his home doctor brought his CT scans and röntgen records to a group of experts.
In December 2011, precisely two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, a sun equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the ribbon and the chest.
I'm an optimist.
I'm mostly just going on," he says.
Honestly, I didn't worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was between Christmas and New Year in the week: "It was told me that it was mesoteliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly, Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, one of whom he recommended to take a lawyer.
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that Asbest was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now craving.
And so Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos in hospitals were under the ground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate into underground candles (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It appears that over several decades after the war hospitals may have been life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treatment doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls due to its fantastic isolating and flaming properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have put their bunsen burners on asbestos.
The theme of Asbest in schools is now frequently addressed on websites.
And therefore, innocent objects in our houses, such as floor plates or soup endachers, have standardly included asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our real estate," says Andrew Morgan, lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that came into contact with a affected woman was the departure of a garden soup in the 1970s.
So you're watching how you're cutting your gardens off.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealthy is immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I did.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas celebration.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective change was from the position of a doctor to the one of the patients.
As countless patients before him, he recalls how overwhelming he was of all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How long do I have?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas celebration.
It was then."
Mesotheliom is particularly foolish because it is our lifekeeping mechanism - breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.
When the asbestos are screwed and the fibres are inhaled, they can be found in the chest pants, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast pan and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled nail-shaped asbestos fibres," said Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who switched to the Guy's hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital of which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed him to asbestos is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesoteliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they will be pressed by the breathing process at the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancer diseases do not work so well in mesotheliom.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly contested.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure necessarily.
"You can't cut the bowel out," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
Because of this, cancer is "not very well addressed to chemotherapy," the "effect shows", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consulting office for fellows four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer centre," he was happy to present himself when calling.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and expected to extend his life by only one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson did, however, "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart Thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had a advantage by not having to be rejected, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and have to wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is decisive for mesotheliom-infected people to be able to observe the best available therapy.
But if these treatments finally fail unavoidably, many of the affected are of another financial concern - about the future of the families that leave them.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan by Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that Asbest is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s, it was realized that a very low burden was also a health risk.
And here the company's negligence began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally instructed their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full-quality compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesoteliom was due to a asbestos contact at Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, however, a speaker of the Guy confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the affected cellar area in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is a huge problem for mesotheliom-infected people who strive to remedy a huge problem to asbestos contact a company or work - usually decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who fight against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the applicants.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation that made it easier for Mesotheliom subjects to claim compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has established a £ 350 million fund supported by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012, but no one can accuse.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 percent of what a court could have claimed in a normal compensation process - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected a year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom subjects that 350 million £ represented a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers had to pay if the time had not gone over and Mesotheliom-infected people found the companies and could accuse them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law is "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, in view of seven death victims, a rapid action is necessary daily.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Law in December of last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation of which he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy with which long-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course with the most important," says Abbott.
You can see that again and again in patients.
There's something that lets you continue.
If you give up, you're getting worse very fast.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
After-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
That's not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Abbott again undergone six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of tumours is visible.
But the process is physically and psychically very difficult.
You have to think of practical things - about the money if I am no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents, it's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I had a disease with which I wouldn't be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very cosy and instill.
She told her friends and soon we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients need to endure.
But for Mesothelio brands, such conversations are not covered by hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as finally also for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a terrible security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life-threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong's right to government election, demonstrators swear remuneration
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese Parliament decided to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach is likely to drive the long-notified protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led the planning and mobilisation of it within less hours after the lobby.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking-threatening candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
The inhabitants of Hong Kong were lying.
And it is clear that we have to do with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-President of the Permanent Committee of the National Convention, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when the UK returned control over Hong Kong to the Chinese, Peking has promised to allow the inhabitants to choose the presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision from Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right of election to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the run through a closely controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates should be authorised "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong have been held for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the movement of Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to dismiss the financial district when Peking does not allow real general voting rights.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central attendants were gathered in rain before the headquarters of the government in Hong Kong within a few hours after the lobby.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further information, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online release, the organizers announced that the movement "the occupyment of the central district only considered as the last means, an action that should only take place if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and no other choice exists.
We are sorry to have to say that all the dialogue opportunities have been exploited today and that the Central District will be definitely occupied.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and there were intensified security measures on Sunday before the government building, including police forces and barrikads.
The distress is increased by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city.
The increase of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to break under the growing pressure of Peking.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central Movement as they threatened the business operation - Hong Kong's lifestyle.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has been criticizing the movement for a long time.
We do not want to make any fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
China's governmentally controlled media recently also reported about the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the rights of elections in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the choosers in Hong Kong.
In July tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school balls in the United States is now transferred to the universities where Freshmen performances with the private aircraft are offered.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the first luxurious travel service of the UK for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the University, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise had to kiss their possessions in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum effort and a maximum of luxury.
A business speaker said that no new bookings have been made since the service had just been introduced, however, added that "the students would book the service in the next weeks".
The company also announced that, despite the study fees of £9.000 per year, it expects a market for this offer.
Students today, in their expectations and demands, are very different from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do exactly that.
However, the National Students Union criticized the service as being cancelled.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems to be completely separated from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month see a crisis of living costs, as the available financial assistance in the form of loans and grants does not, with the strongly increasing accounts, take the easiest courses of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds for as simple as the arrival at the student's home.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behaviour by Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting for the funeral.
After two-week protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teen Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West grew and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women turned 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9, the personal essays came with titles such as "Thinks of Ferguson from a white woman" and "Feminism is not only about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism, you find many people who are white and speak privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt pressed to express something to the events.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they must express this.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson revealed problems that black Americans are exposed every day but are not considered as "woman topics" in cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
When I post something about how colored people are in their own country, the silence is ear-beat.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell who have studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the topics; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the topics of race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at the George Mason University, says that their processors did the opposite.
" Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were cut off and the reasoning was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came at the point on which white fighters for women's elections like Susan B. Anthony analysed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for the right of choice could be successful for each group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to apply for women's right to vote, and the right to vote for black people should come later," said Hattery.
If you remember such things, you will be aware with power of why coloured women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right of election in 1920, it took a decade to organise white women against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group developed almost 40 years after the original request for help from sides of black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists "fangs" played with the problems with which black women have been distinguished for generations.
"Will it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to control the reception?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who built her career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to preventive resources, now try to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went to Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason to understand a danger in the body - and opinions on races that are clearly different in public surveys - will lead to changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem is a rather intersectional feminism in which racial and gender themes are addressed, some of their comments on the race theme in America are still surprising.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "are far more injurious than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson differ from their earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently set up a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help injurious young black and hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that is in the front of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police took up nearly 63,000 unaccompanyed minors at the southwest border of the country this year, the subject of immigration reform will also come back to the surface - this time as a woman theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilises women for the immigration reform, said that for a reconsidering the topic as a major woman theme, they only need to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of the work visum goes to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a postal in the women's organizations," she said.
"Sweine house" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house standing for sale was removed by real estate makers when it became clear that it showed a big pig that it had made it comfortable in the living room.
The free-standing house has a bedroom, is located on a private road in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that his head had bedd on a sofa.
Real estate maker Connells said that the pig on the photo is the pet of the owner.
"The photo was misleading, however, and was now removed," said one speaker of the company.
In the exposé of the house, Connells described the former congregation house as a "one-like family house with a bedroom."
Although the maker has removed the picture from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The house sales provided interest in social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey houses a new millionary after lotto win
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth takes place, with a happy winner who gets nearly 1.1 million dollars from the lottery on Saturday.
A newspaper ski in Harvey moved the jackpot for the second time in five years in the first division, after 1 million dollars in November 2009.
The happy winner, however, still needs to report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit provided conversation in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated profits in the first division last month, an appropriate conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week a player from Canning Vale became one of the five million in August, after a couple from Belmont had achieved the mega win of $7.5 million a few weeks earlier.
The winner pair had played for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionary from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost 85 million dollars.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only the Gladiators were in the match at the first Rheinbach Roman day in the leisure park.
However, the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract far over 1,000 visitors yesterday, who despite the rainstorms and the herbstly cold, and were unpleasantly enthusiastic from the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful series of presentations, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhine country.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter troop of the Gladiators School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate its robust fighting art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert presenter and sent his men in the ring to the heroic twin struggle in various gladiators.
At first, the "provocators" were on the row with a rectangle and a short sword as well as a leg on the left leg and armskin on the right arm.
It followed the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and wurflance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius" who attacked the "security" with casting net, three-sack and dolch, and, after a short struggle, the boys fell to the ground.
Since the swords were metallically connected, the shields created and the wurfflans fled surrounded by the arena that a fear and anxiety could become about the health of the gladiators.
But on that, the impressive "Summa Rudis", the Musculous Divorce, had a always attentive eye.
"We wanted to resurrect the Roman everyday life and make the culture of Roman times experienced," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organiser "Friendskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice-Citizen Claus Wehage found in his greeting word, was a "Oppidum Romanum" for one day.
Finally, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we are admiring today.
The rest of it was also surprising at Roman Day, for example "Aquädukt-Marmor" from the eleven metres high and 1400 metres long Roman Channel Bridge, which was only standing at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once and now presented the water and energy supply, and manager Petra Fricke knew, "We are still benefiting from the knowledge of then".
This also confirms Diplom measuring engineer Ralph Heiliger from the " Engineering Team" from Rheinbach, the Roman measuring instruments such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations anno 1894, as well as stones from the original hypokauste, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressively, too, the footprints that were left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousands ago in the footsteps of tone before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Bodendenkmalpflege at the Rheinland State Association had buried out the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord Industry Park in Rheinbach.
Conversion walls of an economic building with a darre were found to dry cereals and to melt.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, a agricultural good, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of findings from these diggings represented it in a glass vitry, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicious necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ until the attack of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
With her, the children also worked with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote as once the Roman students wrote their names with metal grips on wax tables.
At the stand of the Roman therms Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, basket glass mosaics at the stand of the Rheinbach Glass Museum and serve a heavy wheat mill of stone at the stand of the Natural Center Eifel Nettersheim to male the meal for a flood bread or a musli.
With the original Roman travel car, drawn by two cold flowers, the visitors went through the leisure park and also passed the impressive stand of the urban gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Romer project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the Municipality of Watchberg will also bring itself to the Rhineland-wide Roman year 2014, which is supposed to remember the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 ago.
Together with the home and history associations, as well as the Watchberger Wander Association, the Partnership Association and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem are offered thematic hiking, a lecture, cooking evening and tours for school classes and remember the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionary is told about his work on the nearest watchberg, presented plants as living monuments from Roman times and offered a funny lesson in matters of international understanding between a group of Wachtbergers "Germans" and drawn Romans.
The Adendorfer Grundschule devotes itself to the Roman theme in the framework of a project week.
With the Roman week, the numerous, but often no longer visible trails of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be re-evented.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will be reminded of the foundation of the Berkumer Matronenheiligdom in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic Taxes West Africa's Economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a heavy hit for the economy.
Markets are confiscated - and international companies are on distance.
The devastating Ebola Epidemi is confronting the West African economy with a severe hit.
The harvest is rotten on the fields, the mines are left and the markets are confused - the virus has hardly added to the region.
Some international companies are already going to distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also a economic crisis," judges the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is most affected
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
The market only comes to who wants to buy food or something to disinfect Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, the fever alone fell to more than 600 people.
Recently, the health authorities explained that the disease was precluded in every angle of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
Over 1,500 people died, thousands more attached.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Overall in the resource-rich countries, companies are exerting their operations.
Foreign companies, such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal, withdraw their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying the regions concerned.
The local dealers and farmers also react: Only a few buyers are leaving their home locations to get back.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important to export in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Food will be scarce
"The people will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris's expert on the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables would rather stay at home.
Consequently, the population gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food will be scarce.
In the markets, the stock of basic nutrients, such as rice, disappears.
At the same time, the strongly dependent region of international companies threatens image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies in principle avoid the area over a long time, says Philippe Hugon of French Think Tank Iris.
It is decisive how far and how long the virus will spread.
In the case of investors, "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the strapped state budgets of the States
The disease also burdens the national budgets of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets are strongly struck by the high expenditure on the health system and, in addition, by the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are already in Nigeria, where few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
However, many people elsewhere are already at home because of fear of an inflammation.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced.
Shelters celebrate her 50th anniversary
The "Tannenwald" Berngau gun club celebrates its 50-year-old foundation festival from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours at the Protective Association of Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50-year foundation festival from 12 to 14 September are taking place.
Planned on Friday, September 12, a great entertainment evening with the "Dorfrocker" group.
On Saturday is the big gun shooting at 6:00 p.m.
In the big festival of the voting evening with the "StoapFalzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle cares for music
The peaks on Sunday are the festival service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the great festival at 14.00 p.m.
In the afternoon the price distribution of the Federal and Gaussian.
A particularly beautiful look will be the 25 festivals with their widows.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Citizen Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Voracker have taken over the screen.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" is from 1907, when the Association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment through exercise in room-stoiling and small caliber shooting".
In 1937, the NS regime had led to the dissolution of the association.
Only in 1964 19 young men found themselves again, who raised the "new" "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism on April 30 in Luke's guesthouse.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the association as a protective champion through a difficult early time, where it was primarily to find a association room and install the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965, the protective association started at the guesthouse "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports guards, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the first Gauliga.
The club records purzeled every year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the effectiveness of active protectors has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the association "Leininger" has no longer met the requirements of a modern protective association, the then board under the leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future domicile in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a work performance of 2700 hours, Pfarrer Strasser issued the church blessing for the new protective rooms on May 8, 1988.
One of the major peaks in the United History was certainly the 44th Gaussian, associated with the celebrity of the new shooting flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Protective Association celebrated his 30-year-old founding anniversary.
In 1995 a boller group was founded.
Joseph Schmalzl became Boller’s reference.
A major challenge for the "Böller" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Boller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of honorary work, the members of the association last year have modernized the rooms and the shooting plant in the Berngauer Hof and thus brought up the latest state of technology.
Elf teams in round competition
The sports performance of the protective association can also be seen.
Overall, eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air guns, a air gun crew, a sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann rose to the district Liga 1 in the 2013/14 of Gauoberliga (the highest League in Schützengau ANB).
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
Besides the shooting sports, events such as bucket, facades and kingsball, association trips and Christmas celebration have tradition.
With this, the protectors are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers an accident when returning to the race line
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart went to the wall for the second time, after his right front matrix was placed in round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart took his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said his 14-heady team was disappointed, but now focused on the race on the next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better effort and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can make it better there.
Stewart went to a wall at the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I went in today with quite good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident Stewart's car was loaded into the slepper and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart made three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met and killed another driver at a ash train race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and either win in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation to the tragic incident that led to the death of the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., which had entered the roadway during a race to face Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities informed that the investigations to cause the accident will last at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart has to expect a charge.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart was already in the first 10 and was temporarily on place four.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs happened
Cars with no. 18 except control after the exit from Kurve 2 and collided with Stewart, both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to place 21.
Dance-freuded post-vice searched
Simple try: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and leader Lisa Neitzel (from left) look forward to competitors.
Like many other associations, the Jazz groups in the TV also create the whole day education at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now a stronger growth is being sought for a kind of sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two Jazz and Modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the Jazz and Modern Dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight-to-twelf-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," says the 20-year-old.
With more activities, it would make it much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreography," she says.
If you want to dance, Thursdays between 17 and 18 o'clock or Fridays at the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9, can fall into the training hours without obligation.
"The training starts regularly with a heating program," says the trainer.
Thereafter, various choreographys are exercised.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from Folklore through classic to sport and acrobatics are processed in the Jazz Dance.
Of course, the sociality is not too short.
"We're also going to eat, look at dance films and we've been overnight in the dance room," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group, you could close friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot of for your own engineering development.
Who's not like Jazztanz, he can also snip into one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and adolescents can always walk into the lesson in the fields of children's dance/Jazztanz, Bambini Ballett, Videoclip-Dancing and Hip-Hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you want Discofox, slow Walzer, Vienna Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha and Tango, you can watch and join them.
Bulgarian prison overseers protest around the country
Hundreds of prisoners from all over Bulgaria have organized a countrywide protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also available on a claim list to be discussed with the Minister of Justice of the Interim of Hristo Ivanov.
For one month, the officials have been protesting symbolically against the new working hours and call for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations lasted, the Director-General shared the BNR with Rosen Zhelyazkov for the implementation of criminal measures.
The protest of prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the trade unions Association of Employers of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Ukrainian Army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
In the Ostukraine, the Prorussian fighters are on the front.
After heavy fights, which were supposed to be involved in Russian Panzerbataillones, the Ukrainian Army has now, Monday, abandoned the airport of the Rebellenhochburg Luhansk.
At the same time, the army announced that seven soldiers were killed in the last 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeat of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without mentioning details.
Prorussian separatists shot a plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, prorussian separatists have, according to their own presentation, again shot a fighter and two military helicopters.
Some 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in the Donezk region, according to Russian agencies on Monday.
Coastal guard ships reduced
The oppositionists also claimed for the first time in the Asian Sea to have lowered two boats of the Ukrainian coastal guard.
The Ukrainian border protection confirmed that two of his ships were gunned near the port town of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards were injured, said a speaker in Kiev to the sender 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
In addition, the separatists reported that several villages in the Donezk region were under their control.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
Today, in the Belarusian capital of Minsk, the Ukraine contact group meets.
Apart from the representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a missionary of the separatists from the Ostukraine should also participate in this.
In advance, all actors used their actions to publicly announce their claims.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by the planned stations in Eastern Europe due to the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that the NATO was in line with the 1997 NATO Council's founding agreement.
However, the NATO Head accused Russia of the agreement.
"Today we have to see the reality in the eye that Russia does not view NATO as a partner," said Rasmussen.
Documents and comments from Russian side point out "that they view us as opponents".
Stronger NATO Presence
Rasmussen has also announced that the NATO presence should be strengthened in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be decided at the NATO Summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary," said Rasmussen on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed officially on new discussions on the settlement of their gas dispute.
The negotiations were held for the next Saturday, said Russian Minister for Energy, Alexander Nowak, on Monday.
It is still waiting for a European Union decision to send a representative to the discussions as well.
Because of the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has no longer been able to get fuel from Russia for weeks.
Lastly, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had communicated between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe refers to about one third of its natural gas from Russian sources, which is a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: Maut will come "ganz clear"
Now, the Chancellor again clearly confesses.
A free letter for all complicated details, but it is not.
Heavy concerns from the CDU against the car wall have seemed to be aggravated by the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, after persistent oppositions from her CDU, has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car wall.
"To make it clear, she is in the Coalition Treaty, and she will come," said the party chief on Monday after meetings of the CDU's headquarters in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not focus on a detailed model at first.
In the black-red government programme, "specific parameters" are called.
Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) made a proposal, and it is now being continued to work on it.
However, the NRW CDU persists in their no to a moon right on all roads.
Merkel stressed, also Minister of Finance, Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is constructively engaged in the discussions for a draft of law.
In addition, he also spoke with Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as broadband expansion.
"There is nothing special." Schuble had on Sunday left a "Spegel" report uncommented, his house checked his own concept to reimburse autobahn investors with tax revenues - after election 2017.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer warned that in the cabinet, Maut concepts should be developed against the Federal Minister.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition contract never went out to promote all the circular and federal roads," said the Nordrhein-Westphalian CDU Land Chairman.
In this way, it was an important signal that Seehofer had now announced to discuss the subject again.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDU countries associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Pfalz.
Backgrounds are fears that a wall affects small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition from the CDU's criterion because of the mute criticism.
The left considers the plans in view of the dispute in the Union as failed.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said party chief Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Montag).
"With the moon the Minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a Vignetten obligation on all German roads to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be charged additionally under coalition contracts.
Therefore, they should be fully compensated for the moon through the taxes.
However, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One British says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffered from the Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that harm the nerves outside the brain and spine.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnostics are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motoric disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe gang and crumped toes.
The disease is unhealthy and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, she believed that she suffered from Friedrich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she was 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who are 51 years old today, said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I always fell down and everything took longer.
I could never drive with the other children Rollschuh or Skateboard and was often walking in school because of my kind and running.
Rodgers said that when she was 13 years old, after several operations to discharge her Achilles seens and stretch her feet, she saw her medical documents when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searching for the disease in the library and writing to the FA society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and paniced.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and then all my skills would slowly lose.
I made it all alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said when she became 17, she realized that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, or you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he explained what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT Awareness month to make attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworker since the closing of the former troop exercise station.
For nearly ten years, the former troop exercise site in Münsingen has no longer been shot.
Yet, every month, a mortal ammunition appears in the heart of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb.
The granates are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be exploded on site.
A ear-deeping knee swallows over the heart of the biosphere area at the explosions.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the troop exercise site Münsingen, which was closed after 110 years of military operation at the end of 2005.
Since this time, the 6500 hectare area has been the core part of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb, which is opened on 13 paths for hiking and cycling.
Tax burden of businessmen in the area of Washington increases with economic recovery
Recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published study last week, and the companies in the area of Washington did not constitute an exception.
Companies in the area district, Maryland and Virginia paid together $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in 2013, an increase by 3.8 per cent compared to the 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The government and local tax burden of the companies increased by 4.3 per cent last year to 671 billion dollars, compared to 3.9 per cent in the previous year, and it was the third growth year following the several years of declining 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 per cent, so the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenue of the district, 56 percent, comes from company taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia achieves the lowest tax revenue from companies by 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is justified in receipt of the real estate values of the companies, the researchers say that a increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after the three following years resulted in a growth rate of less than 1 per cent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the run seems to be true for the Washington area.
Company in the district, Maryland and Virginia paid together over $10 billion to state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion 2012 - an increase in one year by 4.2 percent.
However, the apparent recovery of real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing public and local tax revenues, since the real estate taxes are at almost a fifth of the tax decisions of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organisations who do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to offer the same services that other States offer.
The recent recovery of tax revenue by companies cannot be accounted for solely the recovery of the real estate market
The data also appear to be recovered by companies.
Companies in the region reported about income taxes in government organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in company income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, local tax burden for companies does not increase equally in all three places.
The increase rate in the district corresponds to 4.3 per cent to the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported a lower average tax earnings of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has by 6 per cent in all three offices the significantly smallest income taxes (in all three there are fixed business tax rates).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent and in the district is 9.975 per cent relatively high.
A comparative study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, smaller state and local business taxes are required and a better tax climate is in total than in Maryland.
The district was not studied in the study.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its company tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will fall to 5 percent in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the next year, this law could reduce the State's income tax rate to 3 per cent by 2017.
In the meantime it seems to be better for small businesses in the area of Washington, so they pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Company taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure, after which most small companies are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster growth rate than the total company taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in business taxes throughout the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in general tax revenues for the State and local governments by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could fall back if the Federal Government's reduction in expenditure affects the labour market in the region.
Partnerstadt: German beer for Guangzhou
Hopping and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
Deutsches Bier, brown in Frankfurt's Partnerstadt Guangzhou - so is the urgency of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would stay in our city," said Vice-Partei Secretary of the Southern Chinese Metropolitan, Li Yiwei, this week visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
Once again, the functioner of the governmental Communist Party of China returned during the discussion on this issue of the twelve million metropolitans.
Guangzhou, also called Canton in Germany, was one of the richest cities in China, replied Li.
Therefore, people also have the power to buy German beer.
The Hessian SPD Chairman of Thorsten Schäfer Gummer, who led the German Political Delegation, told the host that he would listen to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For beer it doesn't need much: good water, cereals and joy in life," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already shines out Mr. Li, he smiled to the host.
After that, the functioner from Guangzhou stood up with a schäfer-gumble - but with red wine served for the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao returns to German brown art.
Tsingtao-Bier is brused according to the German purity command.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Parteichef Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but was deleted for economic reasons in 2012.
"It would be rewarded," the Communist politician proved convinced.
"Commerce between our two cities is increasingly growing".
At present, travellers had to take the way over Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
The Vice Governor of the Province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire at the forefront of his discussion with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," he replied - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, a intimate expert in Germany, nicked.
Practical partnership
Guangzhou's luminous Vize party hopes that he can visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already at Main, but not in this function yet.
He came to office this year only after his predecessor had been transported from the Office for corruption.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the functioners of Guangzhou is part of a countrywide campaign against corruption in party and administration undertaken by Head Xi Jinping with hardness.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is most unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before his official attendance to Guangzhou, he worked as a top functioner in Fujian, where the Autobauer VW sets up a great work.
Frankfurt has officially received more than a dozen urban partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometres away Guangzhou belongs to those who are cared for by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year-old existence of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropole on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen with its economic power.
The next year she wanted to achieve a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reported Li.
The family of Joan Rivers "presss the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her delivery to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has now proved hopefully that the 81-year-old competitor is recovering from her disease.
"Thank you for your continual love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We're all pushing the thumbs.
According to her mother, sources were delivered to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors are deliberately keeping them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "heart".
The reactions came from many sides, also in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly dust cleaners and rising wages
For cars and dust cleaners that come into trade from today, stricter environmental standards will apply.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new dust cleaner from 1 September will be given to a label on which the buyer can identify central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, stronger nitrogen oxide values are applicable in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the castle builders: they receive a federally uniform minimum wage of EUR 10.25.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video manufacturer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US-$).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one expected a acquisition of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion decided thing, and cooperation also appeared naturally.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it became quickly a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," said an Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre, in which the best acquaintancer gives the (most older) games a attraction of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just that YouTube is often called if you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken up a bit boring, a lesson example of a established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not come, as the company said that it was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
All we now know about it is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another mystery, honestly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to do sport than to watch them, it is difficult to understand the attraction that comes from watching others when playing instead of taking the control console in hand.
It's one thing to watch a friend over her shoulder at 3:00 a.m. while she swears through Resident Evil, and something quite different to see a spider when he's shot 20 times in Call of Duty in his head.
All these games can be viewed right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so it can be a good recipe for headaches without own control over the perspective.
I admit that the quick through courses in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age play all the games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humorvirtuosis, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch is called up by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is being integrated as elegantly in Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have simply swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are advertised as advertisers.
As the Chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of Gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallowing - as a spectator sport.
On the Hüpfburg at the Burggarten Festival, a few of them were on the sunnabend.
The concept of the organizers voted.
Despite the strong rainguss on Saturday night, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.
Time has had to stop the inhalation.
"This was angry," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salvedel l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
For the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness on the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was seen early in the morning when the first visitors joined the Open Air.
A festival for all generations the organizers had promised.
And that has succeeded them.
Around the supply stands on the castle gardens, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the closer and further surroundings had been comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, whipped with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cool drinks - shortly: relaxation pure and enjoyment were observed.
And this through the generations.
While the one on the decks on the extra cartered white sand on the beach bar flourished, others at a quarter of wine in the vinothek, the awakening on the Hüpfburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when the children swallowed, the volunteers had to do all the hands full in the true sense of the word to become the Andrang Lord and to shake imaginative creations into the small faces.
The biggers used the Kickertics or participated in a skateboard workshop that arranged the Goodfoot Crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 7:30 p.m., he boasted on the visitors, especially families searched for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not interrupt this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "result on the whole line".
That is why a repetition of the big party in the next year does not oppose anything.
Although the content and size of the event still need to be worked, Sem made clear in a first balance on Sunday against the referendum.
He was angry and said that the entrance had to be stopped in the meantime.
Apparently, the security company had been booked with too little powers.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the ground anymore.
The resonance had been very good.
In a first cautious estimation, Salzwedeler spoke of about 1200 visitors who wandered in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox disrupted their appearance.
The technicians were not able to create a half-way sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a tyre pane.
"The next year they will be there," said the organizer.
The premieres of the Amula-Open-Airs were more than successful from the visitors' numbers.
And that on bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will have to be dealt with for the first time, but the second edition has to be removed.
Also in the social network Facebook the organizers need to criticize.
"Sorry, but you just expected more for twelve euros," Melanie Meier comments on the event page.
"You've taken a little bit," Ele Zimmermann says at the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I think it's very good that some don't just foolish, but also really try to put something on their legs.
Hut away!", writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now the organizer remains a year to finish these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchberg's true mark shrinks
It's not expected.
Instead, the willing component is waiting to be used in the marking building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the space observation radar TIRA, the shelf, which is called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one.
The size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new cabin is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old cave is separated and removed with a crane.
Afterwards, the last quarter of the new hill is set up.
As far as the weather involves, the action will go over the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant at the Ice-Bucket Challenge distracts Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain shouted so much when her ice cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket Challenge went painfully, too.
A woman was delivered to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice-Bucket Challenge that she pulled off the bowl.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain was circling so much when her ice cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my bowl stayed simple," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is shaken over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't happen, the jaw was hocked, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mother and my sister saw this too and made themselves almost in the hooks before laughing, but I had to go to the emergency record.
The 20-year-old from Britain was delivered to the hospital in order to retract the chicken after participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The Clip was linked to an Internet Sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Soon the castle clubs get back on a strike?
The two Wolfratshauser castle associations have been repeatedly interdependent.
Now the authorities think about possible cooperation.
As an example for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, launched the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the castle club and the castle friend Wolfratshausen.
The positions of the Wolfratshauser Burg and possible reconstruction seemed very different.
Now the two camps are moving together: discussions about a common approach are soon to be conducted.
This confirms the associations Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfriends) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could put together once," reports Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both associations could be able to draw on a strike again in the future.
Thus, there are faster visible successes.
While the castle friends around the suddenly dead Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest in the eye, the castle club around Sjöberg stands at the front of the castle.
Herbert Piffl, second president of the castle friend, was very pleased, according to its own information on the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he is in charge of the castle friends.
A new chairman will be found at a meeting in the mid-September.
At the moment, according to the 74-year-old, the Association counts about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have first let the association activities rest out of respect." This "think phase" had been necessary to "think how it could continue".
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go to the discussion with the castle club.
Until that time, the castle friends could also make themselves a current mood image within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself." He doesn't want to administer himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The interpreter wants to work on the project "but very much wants to continue working".
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in the future.
He appreciates Dimbath as a "Missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air closure.
By a high participation of the population and by voluntary helpers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "And I was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it is useful to advance the project. It could be created a "all-in-setting" feature for the Flößerstadt.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitors tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"The idea of reconstruction I personally do not want to simply throw over board." He hopes that the castle club might move something on this point.
Their goal to document history first is "is important and good".
After that, you could see.
Clever ways to save at uni-learning books
Since the cost of uni learning books for many students amounts to more than 1,000 dollars per year, the fast-second student Matt Schroeder considered a clever sparidee.
He acquired a loan system for books of students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-file A-Cook," said Schroeder, 19, who visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college leadership announced that the students spend more than $1,200 per year for teaching books and study materials, but there are different cost reduction options for the students.
Online charges and creative approaches such as Schroeder are increasingly the solution to the choice for the students.
Renting lessons becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, who operates more than 250 universities booklets, announced that the rent of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Inquiries in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in the college books last spring semester, said Nobo's Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased in Campus books according to the Trade Association National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one thing for the best deals.
Buy Online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are to be in the Campus book store.
The nineth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be paid to the specialized teacher Chegg.com for $239,99.
Buy Used
If you don't have any other notes or normal traces of use, the books used are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93,49.
Matt Casaday, 25 graduate student at the Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for an edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business."
The book was newly sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at the Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors whether previous expenditure were allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, half.com from eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting lessons is worth considering if you treat them somewhat well, think of returning them and you do not want to keep the books after the course is completed.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Please inform yourself of the provisions of the business where you rent, including the penalties that may be charged for writing notes, submissions or traces of use.
Careful: If you don't return the book, the penalty charges may even exceed the price of a new book.
EBooks
E-books instead of traditional teaching books are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a specific period of retailers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
In Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering teaching books can be very expensive.
Look around at any case.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination of books, as you can be so sure to find the right teaching book.
And before an online order, you should check, so Gault, if the book is actually predictable.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the college book store.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a boxer
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone included less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only amounted to $12 million in his budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" that was cut on Cameron Diaz, played only $14.6 million at the opening week, while children's films like "Drake Tums" made it easy to disappoint 2.
A article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in the children's films, the lack of quality could be the reason for the films themselves.
In 2014, Collin referred to as "the worst year" for children's films and described "Drake counts made easy 2" as purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, in films for a slightly older target group, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, entertainment Weekly compared the average cinemaScore and metacretic rating for each summer film start, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and the current year to at least 2000 line walls.
The results are based on the opinion of the cinemas and film critics and point out that this year's film heat is equivalent to that of the last year.
Some commentators believe that development is due to changing sight habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon appearing jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times change."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood production, Netflix has recently achieved sales with the streaming content of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which the sales amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they focused too much on filming of comics and prophesied a "kern melt" Hollywoods.
In the light of the current deviation, some commentators argue that his darker prophecy could contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cassiers to be expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the fall of the cash results as simply "cyclic" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the largest summer at the cinema, and no one will worry about the business."
When a few years ago the second table tennis district class was deleted for the punishment of the Lige division, this has been a step in the right direction.
The German Tischtennisbund has now taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the programme.
The result: Whoever has not risen has gone down.
Thus, Göttingen's highest class team Torpedo in the Oberliga delegation has avoided the decline, but only five times in the coming season.
Fourth-class Torpedos ladies, despite their great throughmars into the regional League.
The boys and girls from Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lengler and the Torpedo Reserves arrive in the new Association League, in the Landesliga are no longer represented by Göttinger Clubs.
With the women, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo-Zweite in the National Liga.
What looks like a better district class is now the new district soberliga South.
TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Inbeck, Hammenstedt, Upper SV, Langenholtensensen, FC Weser and TTC.
As regional representatives of Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of TTC II, red-white, Upper SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The district sober League of the ladies begins at least in sound strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are starting in the district League.
With nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district League.
The SCW boys' district leaflet - there is still Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go to the season.
During the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttinger circularly start with each nine teams.
In the West Staffel, the Red-White II, Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Milenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East Staffel, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen are playing.
The Queen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of Easterode, where there are no more women teams at circle level.
Noting that none of the six 2rd crèches can reach sound strength, here the innovative and transversal circular board will have to consider once.
NATO Summit: First Protest in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people in Cardiff gathered before the city hall there to hold a so-called counterpeak.
Stephen Fairclough has pursued the developments in the weekend and spoke to demonstrators travelling from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers fled out of the Blue Mountains
TWEE youthful bush migrants were brought safely with the rope winds after they were caught the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up in Govetts Leap in Blackheath to their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon.
Caring relatives called the police at about 20 o'clock when the two had not returned home.
A search force from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found at about 23 o'clock near Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had hurt herself at the knee, and the man had crashed, and he had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed with the couple overnight, and they were fled out on Monday tomorrow.
They were delivered in a stable condition with a car in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Escalate government hostile protests in Pakistan
About 1,000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The sender has restarted the radiation after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial.
Dead or injured persons have not been reported.
The demonstrators call for the withdrawal of the Head of Government to which they are proposing election fraud.
The police announced that about a mile away from the residence of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had again collapsed from about 3,000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
After hospital statements, a policeman was injured.
In the weekend at least three people had been killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to move to Sharif's residence.
They require the withdrawal of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening, after a meeting in the army headquarters, the mighty military had called on a political solution to the conflict, "less to waste time and use without violence".
The Communication further stated: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the State."
The escalating violence has caused concerns about the intervention of the military, which has already been more frequent in the past.
The protests quoted by opposition politician Imran Khan and the Preacher Tahirul Qadri lasted since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif rejects a retirement.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to endure on Sunday.
"We will not go back without having forced Sharif to retire," Khan said.
Qadri spoke similarly.
Khan presupposes Sharif to have won Parliament's elections in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the withdrawal of central and province governments.
Then a transitional government will reform the election system and call for new elections.
More than 40 000 security forces are in use to protect the government quarter.
At first, the demonstrators had persisted peacefully before Parliament until Khan and Qadri urged them to move to Sharif's residence on the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after the second season victory on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday took a pleasant end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team with the out in the Europe League had reached an intermediate depth on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed Captain and Torschützen Steffen Hofmann, who met with green-white on place three.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid on Siegerstraße Rapid, with the second season victory, has shown the right response to disappointment against Helsinki and goes with a success experience into the country game break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said external defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership volley, put the soaks on victory in the 14th minute.
"I thought I had the whole frustration of Thursday and swallowed it under the late," the 26-year-old smiled.
When Schrammel had met on November 13, 2010 for the last time in a Bundesliga party, this was still for Ried.
The first mastership strike in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me, that's something very special, I'm from the Rapid-Awake," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term bucket blessing, Schrammel turned from the left to the right defensive side and also made his thing very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a sphere.
The gate he deserved, he has already done some assistants here," praised Barisic.
Team shows Character Schrammel also delivered the Flanke to 2:0 by Hofmann after well one hour, which finally made the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have been able to sign up.
"Good thanks we have had some luck today," also Schrammel noted, who thus referred to the distinguishing of performance and results in the past weeks: "The results have not voted, but the playlist was always good compared to the last year".
Barisic even found that "in many games before" had been better than today - against "the strongest team played in this season at this stage".
The first three points since July 26 have thus proved that the team vessel was intact in spite of the relapses: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
Not less delightful to him: "That we finally played too zero again."
Many work during country play breaks Also the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger are to complain about several accidents, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their start-up debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget it," said Barisic, who lost the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "which have been very stable in recent times".
The pauses of the country must therefore be used in order to "smoke wounds and to put a bit in the physical field," explained Barisic, who has five U21 selection actors in its series.
One of those who thinks the break will be specially located is Captain Hofmann.
He screws himself for the team, overcomes pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," said Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his exchange in the 68th minute, not only the structure, but also the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first match from the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 on the admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We certainly have had a little luck too, but at some point the luck must also come back to us.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He urged to work concentrated further: "You must not always see this black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as it has been shown.
But we can't believe that now everything's all right.
He could not contest the importance of his role in the team.
It's a very young team that I can help very much right now.
They're going to hold on to me in some stages," said Hofmann.
Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to pretend and his team.
He regretted the fast matches "from the category of magic" as well as the regular gate of use in the 40th minute, which had been unfairly recognised by arbitrator Collegger.
The only presumption I can make to the team is that in some stages we were not concrete enough.
We've had too little conclusions.
Indoor defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It just started bad, but then we found clean and even made a gate.
In general, more would have been inside.
Ruh is ruled under this controversy
We showed a powerful tribe on our ride of the summer series "My piece of the Rhine luck" last Friday.
Several of these treeries are still available in the district, the pictured copy is the "beet coat" above the underweed brown.
A holpriger footway leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes by groups, basalt stones and basalt stone lakes.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, it stands there.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it stretches beyond the other trees of the environment and reminds us of an American mammut tree with a range of more than eight metres.
A small Buddha on a treestump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intense investigations, there were only references to the origin of the names.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has further consulted the Bishopsheimer archive and asked older people from underweet brunn to learn what concerns it has with the nuts.
The result of his research remained the quite naughty explanation for the name.
Thus, up to about 80 years ago, the goats should have driven their animals from underweed brown to the roughly reded and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal guards who were exhausted from ascension must have rested.
In the meantime, the area has won its meaning back, because the wheat actually weighs goat herds again.
The area has also been explained to the core zone of the biosphere reserve, cutter has further found out.
When you enter the stone collections, however, you should be careful, because the warmed basalt from the sun is also a popular residence for crossrothers.
A hiking path leads from subtle brown to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are painted, the direction of high rope rises and invites to expanded hiking.
Where's the Waterburg?
However, a waterburg that is searched for at our next task is rather rare in the height.
The reflection in the grave already gives a good impression of the construction, but we have some historical buildings in the countryside that could fit the building fei.
Where is our "Stück of the Rhine luck"?

After a week of departure, Italy's Prime Minister and President of the EU, Matteo Renzi, has undertaken the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as Head of EU External Policy against strong conservative resistance at the EU's Special Summit last week, she is a successor to the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the nearly government newspaper La Repubblica represents the calling of its Mogherini, also in the government team, as a favourite, as a strengthening of the position of social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects a drive for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes to make the left-party base, which is constantly opposed to him, quiet, because Mogherini is assigned to it, although rather in a decent way.
Against the Conservative Representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President-in-Office of the Council, Poland was nominated Donald Tusk, the dominant opinion in Rome, so that a political compensation could be made.
For at the same time, the EU's chief diplomat becomes vice-president of the Commission's President Juncker.
The remaining consent of the EU Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President-in-Office Giorgio Napolitano would not have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the reigning Democratic Party (PD) a "weighty recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that for nearly two decades they have proved in leading party offices and Mogherini, known for its ambition, will grow up with the "smart challenges".
The born Roman is married and has two daughters.
Their party career began the promovated politics in 1996 in the youth organization of the then democratic di sinistra (left Democrats), which joined the Catholic Center Party Margherita in 2008 to the present Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Youth Socialists).
With the election in 2001 to the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she grew into the high party policy, working in the External Policy Department, whose leader she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO operation in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a troop quota, contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Defence and European and International Affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his Foreign Minister.
Nowadays, if the PD has a better relationship with strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the more than 40 percent of the party's votes in the EU's elections in May, then, as it is noted in PD-crises, Federica Mogherini has a share in it.
The retentions in Brussels, which the new EU external representative has too little diplomatic experience, therefore, if there is no substance, will be addressed in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, misrespectful accents of Mogherinis to the crisis in Ukraine are persecuted and diffamed as a "Russian-friendly course".
It welcomes the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to be transported directly to South Europe through the Russian natural gas, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi entered its term of office as EU Chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow to her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the Shake hand were taken in Brussels with embarrassment, as well as inviting the Kreml Head to a Milan Economic Summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among these is an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In four training professions, the new staff will be active in the future: electronics (three trainers), mechatronics (two), tool mechanisms (two) and procedure mechanisms (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bookl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form Forest, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel uncertainties and Sebastian Zahner from Pfrimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new educators had previously attended main schools or middle schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainers of all the years, as well as the trainers, go to a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, there is a full day migration and rafting on the inn on the program.
The company counts in Germany 435 and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of educators distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep the mouth and arrange France," said Francois Hollande's most important allies.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "your love" for the controversial socialist president whose cabinet conversion has been struck to disapproval with the large majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said at a great applause.
As an important gesture, the Prime Minister stated that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite strong demands for a relief of the regime by Emmanuel Macrons, the new economic ministers.
On Saturday, Mr. Holland had urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, struck Sand into the drive in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist Members and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, ridiculed the constant grave fights of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would persist for a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothing, but Prince Manuel Valls has no, they are forced to form a new government if the old one didn't even survive a summer.
"And the new one will not also survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the reputation of her party after a resolution of Parliament and said that she was confident that it would be a victory in preferential elections and will be ready for the government.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat at the municipal elections in March and the legally judged national front was at the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday Journal du Dimanche showed that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the danger of breaking into several rivalizing groups before the end of the period of office in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not aim to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but the public opinion must feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could continue to worsen.

Pro-Hong King-Activists condemn China on the day following the election decision.
A peking-threatening group was hiking near the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress adopted on Sunday a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be occupied with peking faithful members.
By this decision it will be almost impossible for opposition democrats to be electoral and pro-democratic activists to perceive their threats and to suspend the Hong Kong financial space with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial topic in Hong Kong, and China's party leadership fears that the call for democracy extends to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper, in which China's predecessorship over Hong Kong was presented in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on the election procedure in the special administration region, where hundreds of thousands of people marched in the city's business district and organised a seat in it.
Lis survey is organized by the Government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Connection Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs, Zhang Rongshun and the Vice-Director of the Office for the Affairs of Hong Kong and Macao of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be consulted over the day.
Student activists announced to gather themselves in the afternoon before the headquarters office in Hong Kong.
The UK did not provide any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands the inclusion of "state talks" with the ostukraine
According to Russian President Wladimir Putin, Russian media reports on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian Government set up the fight against the separatists in the eastern part of the country, and directly engaged in negotiations on "state" of the descendant region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the Ostukraine area under the control of the separatists would be a part of Russia, but that its status to Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiever Government to negotiate at an eye with the pro-Russian oppositionists is in line with the strategy followed by him since the expiry of five months ago: aid for the separatists in taking areas and pressure on the Ukrainian Government to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossija region to be in fact independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the West.
In an interview with the State Television Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to regain the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donezk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian Peninsula Crime on 18 March.
The Kreml and the Separatists have recently referred to the intake area as "Novorossija" or "New Russia", a term that reminds of the prerevolutionary glossy time of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that in the course of the Ukrainian campaigns, all those who attack civil communities in the areas held by separatists are hoped to be "fucked into their illusions", itar-Tass reported.
"We must have detailed discussions instantly, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of the society and the state status of the Southostukraine to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to stateality had to be seen in the context of the greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the chief leadership for months in order to distort fears in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
It's not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "because it's not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the creml speaker for correcting the "Fehl Interpretation" of Putin's comments underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct emerging of the Crime, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more difficulty to attract the Donezk and Luhansk regions in the Ostukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict gave a wide majority for the remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the Ukrainian regional governments power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and thus give the Kreml de facto control over an area that combines the Russian state area with the Crimea.
The five-month peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian Marine, as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, plants and poisons that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed, in his speech on 7 June, that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should be taken into account the additions to the Constitution, with which the respective territories are given greater control of their finances and the status of the languages.
But his idea of autonomy appears to be in sharp contrast to those of the Creml and the separatist rebels whose arms and upscale Moscow is forecast.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at the height of the eye, followed after a further advance of the rebels last week, after Russia's troops and panzers have entered the Ostukraines through the former peaceful region along the Asian Sea.
The Separatists supported by Russia took over in the field, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials, is the first step in the campaign to take the strategic coastal region up to the Crimea, control of Nowoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been undertaken to establish Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants located between Nowoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a EU leadership meeting in Brussels and urged to take action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are in front of a point where there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign pants are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not adopt any concrete actions, which demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian pancer columns and 1,000 soldiers joined the Donezk region last week to support the confronted separatists, said Colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first most likely 63 Ukrainian soldiers, which were included by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian prisoners who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced Sunday.
Night Photoscandal for Australian Promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey noblest made no heal about his trouble about Hacker, who probably stole naked images of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who's Who of the A promise from Hollywood.
The film city is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared in a hacking candal around promis on the Internet.
The hacker, which is responsible for this, probably has 60 naked photos of Lawrence, Star from "the Tributes of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Of the Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were claimed to be public because of a iCloud gap.
There are 101 promises on the list.
Edelstens who had engaged in Grecko last month, said to Confidential, "It's foolish."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and transmitted to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, reports from a news website said that the hack was "shameful" and that the affected people felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-friend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which it is located upstairs without a pool.
Among the film works Palmers include "Liebe is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the hacked pictures.
A representative Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It is a horrible violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "Hackled images from a mobile phone are nothing but the sale of Hehlerware."
Just legally, the spread of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Radlers, yggers and hikers were there yesterday at the 8th bike on the Great Field Mountain and thus supported the Association "Help for Craft Disease Children".
The tour, which was one torture, represented a light training for the others.
In one, however, everyone agreed: It has been fun.
Thomas Studanski probably had a good sleep last night.
For the first time in his life, the chief of the chief chief of the bride house was driving yesterday with the wheel on the field mountain.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cater, especially the participation on the 8th wheels on the Great Field Mountain in favour of the Association "Help for Cancer Disease Children" (Frankfurt) has also provided him personally a valuable knowledge.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can - great!"
Small pussy on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would've been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is sitting for the CDU in the Upper Urselan City Parliament, many of the 718 participants were tortured to mountains yesterday in the Spring Day and came near the exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier for others to overcome the well eleven kilometres long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
For example, Norman Dießner.
The red green politician from the circular day - red dress, red bike - made something on understatement ("Every quantity of professionals, there is the target!"), but then the mountain was half a professional and went through the target after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the route in a slide, like Nina Kuhn, press speaker of the city of Oberursel, who had gone along with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathlets, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not necessarily a sports challenge: "This is about charity, there we are with it - we'd have made an exit today," Kuhn said.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) went down to Upper Ursel in the morning to strike back to the height right thereafter.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swept home at the Sattel in the morning at nine o'clock, "making" the fieldberg two times to roll home with fun.
Funny also had "Fritten-Toni".
For the chief of the Cultiosk's chief, bicycle tours simply include the field mountain.
He had speculated 40 minutes with his 6.5 Kilo race wheel.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says he's an ambitious racer.
He must also be, because he was on the way with the Fixie Council, which are also racing wheels, but without switching...
The fact that it went up without bicycle locker did not only prove the 20 hikers who rose up over the White Wall and the fuchstance to the summit, but also a ygger who drew a car mature with weights on a cord.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, cared for security, said: "The one I know from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sliding trail, only that he pulls the slides himself." So the man is his own sliding dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - had been sent in groups on the route in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 p.m.
It followed the first cyclists and runners at 10 o'clock.
Five minutes later, the first mountainbikers left.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Radeln auf der Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wanted the participants a nice trip.
Next year he hopes that it will be possible to lock the route up to the field mountain to the security of the participants.
