A Republican strategy to oppose the re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to fight election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center last considers a myth by confirming that the election fraud in the United States is more rare than the number of people killed by lightning.
In addition, in 10 years the Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States.
One is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of elections.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the United States' democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US States are responsible for the implementation of the elections in each country.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments have announced new laws since 2009 which have made it difficult to registrate the procedure for registration or incorporation.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the elections of November 2010, where 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states.
As a result, 180 legislative drafts were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of electoral law in 41 states.
The new election laws require the voters to provide a light-screen certificate and a proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the periods of premature voting, declare the right to register as a voter on the election day, and refer to the right of electoral citizens for which a court act is present.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. State has required the voters to show a lighting certificate.
Indiana was the first state that raised such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republican authorities quickly extended this practice to other countries.
Over the last two years, they encouraged draft laws in 34 states to force the electorate to display a light-shaped indication.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, the US citizens do not have a universal card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million electoral persons, do not have a photo ID issued by a governmental authority of their state.
In addition, five million new selectors in 2012 do not have such a certificate.
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to be paid to obtain the necessary certificate.
The new restrictions affect young people, minorities and people with low income unproportionately.
In fact, 25% of the Afro Americans, 15% of the people with a income of less than $35, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the choosers between 18 and 29 years do not have the necessary photos.
This is still enough.
The students who are viewed as voters who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their photos of the ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing associations or hunting associations who choose more for the Republican side to use the cards for elections issued by these associations.
Before 2004, no Member State has requested a proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state which introduced such a claim.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that the voters require them to demonstrate their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting hispanic votes.
For it is clear that two of three hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators have promoted laws in eight state states, with which the registration of voters was cancelled on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns for electoral registration in the 2004 general elections have contributed to registering about 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new selectors in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted legislation in five other states aimed at reducing the time limit for premature voting.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida 33% of the voters in advance were Afro-Americans, although they are only 13% of the national voters.
The same applies to the hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who had chosen in advance.
On the other hand, the whites represented 76% of the voters were only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their followers have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several legislative drafts were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The U.S. General Attorney has taken action to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws that require the display of a light-sharing.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of electoral law difficult.
The democratic critics plead the political nature of the laws adopted and view in them as a clear objective the impact of the results in the states that are decisive for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the States which have adopted these laws constitute 171 of the 270 votes necessary in the election body to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation in the election system will have significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation of elections.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the United States' democratic system.
Prostate cancer pre-identification: should the test be made or not?
In fact, the PSA test shows sometimes malicious results, with false negative or also false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to stronger delays in the men already undetermined for carrying out early identification tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We picked up the opinion of two specialists.
In the U.S. studies, there were numerous disturbances between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.
This study has also shown that the probability of the formation of metastases is 30 to 40% higher in a 12-year post-observation if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from 50 years of age and 40 years when you have a direct relative who had already been ill at prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of Afro-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer disease has been detected.
There are cancer types that are aggressive and others who are indolent.
The patient must really be understood the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing the possible options where prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect life quality in the long term and in these cases it is more likely to decide to monitor the disease actively.
Today, there is no treatment for many men in whom cancer is recognised, since their cancer is not aggressive and is not a threat to their lives.
They are suggested an active surveillance and offer them treatment when the disease is progressed.
The criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who should not be determined are increasingly precise.
That is why I still recommend the execution of the test.
But most importantly, it is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international Urology Society, Movember has developed an instrument to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous means to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress made in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk to it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer diseases could be prevented if everyone eats well and moves sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," stresses André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancer diseases are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco dependence remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancer types.
It harms the health of people.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the speaker André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the absence of the cigarette, the risk of death of cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and adipositas also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast-feeding, grim tarm, mast tarm, food tubes, abdominal peel and bowel cancer.
"The research indicates that regular physical activity protects throughout life against groom darm cancer," he adds.
Nutrition
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of cramping an angry or mast darm cancer.
Wurst products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smokers, driers or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"After, the body cells can harm and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have examined the link between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, their investigations are not yet concluding.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another showed a higher increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preloading.
"The execution of a early identification test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs Boson last summer has excited a certain look, and this for good reason.
It is actually believed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than in the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence was foretold from the standard model - our best or "at least false" declaration of nature and the behaviour of the matter - but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is strongly similar to the Higgs Boson foretold by the standard model.
In addition, this appears to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physics convention in Kyoto, but there are still no data to be fully sure about it.
Nevertheless, let's assume that it is actually the Higgs, because it seems that there is only a small risk of deceit, and let's look at what's going on.
There is an indispensable law in this world that makes two objects unable to be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try too strong as you get hurt.
For even if particle physics are a really weird world, it appears that it also applies to such a law: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which says that two particles are not able to occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "Quanten state", with this "condition" largely consists of some of their properties.
From this point of view, the physicians divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who are called Fermione and are similarly obeying the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons, an evil band of anarchists who are nothing sacred - at any rate not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are divided into two groups, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Labors (which is absolutely amazing) in two groups: the Mesons that we are not being treated here and the "power particles" by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs Boson would be related.
But it must be emphasised here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you could think.
If you are able to read this chronic, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "botte" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "crashed" exactly in this place, in about like a kisel stone that has been thrown into a pond.
This "störning" creates a electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "truckers of power".
Stabiliser field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "crashed" so that this boson appears.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the generator needs to achieve very high energy, a little similar to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be distorted by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator like the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and not all materials interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a sheet paper would never keep from itself on the refrigerator.
And also not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (like the photon) do not have a mass.
For what can all these research now be "good," Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science they serve the review of the standard model (SM), and they also enable physics to examine all variations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
Moreover, there are many physicists who are most desperately hoping that such variations are found, as the smallest difference opens a door to a "new physics" and could stop some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great shortcomings, as there is no explanation for gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms about 80% of the matter of the universe (new ups!).
However, such variations have not been found in the CERN until now.
Effects
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no one.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the dead physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who developed the first permanent laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - already said that the laser was considered rather a "laborer game".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also be produced from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in the optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves all the digital cameras worldwide as "Auge" and has brought him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that LHC’s activities will necessarily change our life, but it means that you can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
With its Committee on Death in Dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the hot issue of the end of life.
The debate must be restarted soon, although a draft legislation is being prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important topic.
Le Devoir has tried to look closer on this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him had left him a two-year period.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said halfhearted, lying in his bed in the home for Palliative Care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived on the morning.
"Everything is always a shock, you can't be prepared on it," he says.
The disease does its work: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
At the table sitting before a delicious lunch, he welcomes resignation to be helped at dinner.
He is courageously able to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications and offer him a bath.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is that you cure my diarrhoea, as this is humiliating," he informs.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man is stinging up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois's home.
To return to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"This depends on the ability of the person," he says, taking a step back.
For several people who work in palliative care thinks that major events are taking place in the midst of these backwards.
The patients who are assigned to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overcome by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by degradation".
But through the disease, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no longer wishes in life," she says before she accepts that a mask is set up to help her breathe.
She still expects a last visit to her son, who comes from Italy in the next days.
The home Victor-Gadbois offers a group of volunteer body care and support in the food collection.
Palliative care will then be used if there are no other possibilities.
To make the death more pleasant.
In Quebec, 11.700 inhabitants have a bed for the palliative care.
That's very little if you take into account that one day we'll all die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You are given a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi depending on your wish.
Diabetes must no longer control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer who died during the night.
Today morning his son will drink the beer to the feet of the dead.
"We also help relatives and patients," reports nursing director Nathalie Savard.
The home of Victor-Gadbois is not a day like the other one.
In addition to an old 93 - year - old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his head cocks, while being attacked at his honor, a young man of 36 years surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children dies in a tragic way after trying to survive everything.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients aged less than 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel worryingly.
53% of Victor-Gadbois-designed patients come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to a care that will reduce the suffering of patients when the latter have reached the final stage of their life, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the company for home palliative care in the large area of Montreal, are specialized in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this great inadequacy in Quebec's healthcare ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care are concerned with the adoption of a law on death aid and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifest has been signed by prominent personalities of the Palliative Care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in order to prove their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not efficient enough to ensure that all have the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting to go to death aid.
Recently, she says, I've seen a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency record without taking measures to relief.
I fear that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologens treat their patients despite the worst forecasts bitter until the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she discontinued a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I'm going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she's sorry that I'm giving up the fight, she told me.
But she told me that I was at the end!
No unnecessary care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff that it did not take place this wish after their pain has been relieved by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly said that palliative care in pain treatment is not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, leader of the Palliative Care of the Society of Home Palliative Care of the Great Area of Montreal, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often take back to the terminal sediment, which is going on to inject the patient either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer do as if we do not see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will be increasingly able to reverse to this terminal seedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved say all the same sentence, "I want to die."
But that means not necessarily, "I want you to sleep in me," but "I want my pain to be relieved."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandale large sizes in Quebec
Officers of the Road Building Office, the company of the main construction industry, the financial manager of political parties and the Italian Mafia's specialists tell each day what they know about a great "system" in which construction, officials, politicians, trade unions and mafioso are involved.
"Industrie", which was very expensive for the taxpayer in Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system has crashed since a drastic action has been taken," jokes Jacques Duchesneau, member of Quebec and former police leader of Montreal.
The scandal was revealed by him due to an in-depth examination of the distresses in connection with the conventions on road construction in Quebec, which the Prime Minister of then had only opposed.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and the coverage of officials.
"After the start of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport had saved a billion dollars on the contracts alone," because some instinkted to receive their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to fall," he adds, in the hope that it will be able to show "the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anticorruption unit established in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011 also makes great efforts with its troops to economic auditors, to identify and to analyze the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau troope", which since 2009 has made the Montreal Canalization Card more restraint in the artificial upheaval of the Treaties...
In the last few weeks, she has carried out regular house searches and charges for fraud and corruption against local mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a pre-City.
The next one on the list was Gilles Vaillancourt, who just retired from his office as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected that in exchange for public procurement, it has repeatedly received lubricants.
On the other hand, it was explicitly accused of engineers of the Montreal Road Building Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has excited attention by explaining the functioning of the "system" to the Commission for the maintenance of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a intermediary associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr. Zambito played his hand everywhere by giving over 88,000 Canadian dollars (circa 68,000 euros) to province parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at that time.
He also managed to organise an unlawful provision for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Construction contracts whose costs were artificially charged by it
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former Bauingenieur Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and icockey games, as well as coverage money of $736,000 as a remuneration for channelling contracts, whose cost he artificially blew.
Other officials of the Road Building Office have admitted that they were embarrassed by artificially blowing the bills with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, a organiser of the Mayor's Party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately looking over a shadow budget that filled his boxes with black money.
As a result of these disclosures, Mr Tremblay has withdrawn from the beginning of November, which fell into a severe crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal who struck alarms.
As a mayor of the district Rivière-des-Priiries, in the eastern part of the island, she rejected the sale of a municipal property for 5 million dollars and was sold on to 1.6 million farmers in the booming real estate market from 2010.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the study, which is finally carried out, it says that it "draws on a thread that enables it to understand the functioning of the system undermined by ants to stop the evil and attract the guilt".
She says that the procedure is " painful, but positive".
We are in purifying the wounds, however, need a research unit only for Montreal, as well as a supervision to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, on the other hand, that officials have stolen several hundreds of million dollars, but are especially concerned about the role of "manate leaders who are in the picture" if they were not involved in fraud!
Based on a proportion of 70% of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this was only a weak depreciation of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit the donations to parties to $100, which would not change the situation to him: "As long as the elections are not strictly limited, black money will be in the policy in circulation."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for public procurement and the financing of the parties: "We can't fall deeper; by going to the ground with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international face of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh about throwing a look into their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
During this season, you have adopted a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on her side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my level of game.
And in a game, this is even easier.
It's going very fast in the football.
But I don't break out in excitement.
Since my beginnings in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine up to my playtime at Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed gradually.
They thus make use of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new access to this summer is used to carry out very high levels of games.
You also know that every training unit is decisive.
This leads to a player like me who has to offer his forehead and want to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti has respect for all technicians.
In Ligue 1 there is currently no comparable person, and it is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with viewed associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win further titles in Paris.
In January, I had a encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has put in me is also a explanation for my services.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1 Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we're in the back.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified ourselves in this way for the eight-final.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our words to speak against very good European teams.
First, we want to become the first of our group before Porto, so that we can endure the replay of the eight-final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in a short term?
He's already got the budget for that...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win a title and make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
In financial terms, the PSG gives its resources to adopt concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1 as this was the case during the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really our heart to dismiss this title.
During the last season, we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry out the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong performance.
We've finished with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Although the big teams, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, ring the title, I think we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot of us is expected.
We accept this perfectly.
However, if we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and we still find something that can be proposed, this is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what the people are expecting.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to create a game concept.
A team builds up with time.
In the Champions League, we proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, a association who has not been able to qualify for the eight-final since two seasons, and who has also done enormous expenditure!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to play pause with 15 points in advance!
This meant that our opponents and the French mastership would not be watched.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good during the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smile winner and tell us we have finally won it despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
To make it better that you talk about a "Zlatan dependency".
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and proves that he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he has been aware that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he has done is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders worldwide, also enables everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injuries prevented me from squeezing some time of play.
I've seen things from which I've been strengthened.
Today I manage to achieve good games in the National Team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "blue".
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our teachings, and today we have to show an example of conduct.
What opinion do you have about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "blue"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the Qualification Group for the WM.
The national trainer is strict, stands close to the players and appeals to the victory.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "blue" to Brazil.
Is the distinguishing forced in Spain on 16 October (1:1) a recording game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin you can pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is viable: the conviction that the current monetary system created by bank monopolies leads to financial crisiss.
In fact, the Bitcoin found by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertable to dollars, euros etc.) and a protocol for safe exchanges such as BitTorrent which allows direct exchange of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers on the network.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as donation or as payment means.
After the course of Bitcoin reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later to $2 before recovering to $10 (the courses are listed on the Bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "like the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other kinds of virtual currencies such as the "Credits", which are used to advance in a video game that can be won or purchased by games (and sometimes re-changed).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are at the same time keepers of the account book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the content of the file it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins are available in the public accounts accounts spread throughout the network.
The crucial step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This happens through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, adding this additional line to the winner, who is a kind of preliminary central banker who has privilege.
It is a piece of the file, i.e. converting a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that produces a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can hardly check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wishes to pay two times very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain without link, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer who solved the task gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this remuneration will be halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but have been divided to a hundred million set, which makes a certain space...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with any improvement in the performance of the calculation.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The used weakness does not concern the actual protocol," assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also reveals these shortcomings.
Important actors such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
By others like the blog platform WordPress they are accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analysed the account book and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a Mega sale was launched.
"Three thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company, is delighted to convert Bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a book about this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin uses to validate the transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented in traders, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just have to specify one address that can be "fotografed and recognised" by a phone, Pierre Noizat insists that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are considered to be more horizontally oriented.
"Bitcoin will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB also proposes in its report to re-evaluate the various risks that are considered high today in the event of a success of this currency.
We moved out of Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to re-establish its territory and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we punished the Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have been fleeing to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse a armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaetic traditions, even if they joined them Djihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Usbekos and Tadschikhes.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local oppositionists, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discrete.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the support point in Nijrab, which I have observed by a hill planted with mantle trees that was financed by French loans, was correct.
The truck and panzer convois, surrounded by helicopters, have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will be no more influx of the Taliban in Kabul.
From 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was transferred from war due to the battles of the various rebellious groups.
Their power overtake was then considered to be a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved until today.
Former Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Sovjetic war have come back to power in 2001.
They have transformed into businessmakers by deploying lands of the government to sell them to refugees from Iran and Pakistan as a construction land and thus benefit from the massive American contraction of subcontracts.
They brought themselves into prosecution, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fights.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not composed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who were able to make use of American spending: the capital flight is significant.
The young people are tired of war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the government schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the party or to corruption of certain leadership forces will have to provide jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; television with its Turkish series, which represents a modern world, is viewed everywhere.
There is now a army.
Are the authorities under whose authority they will be considered legitimate?
Former Commanders of the anti-Sovjetic fight already strive to restore the militia in the province, which will withdraw from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identitys should have benefited from a certain decentralization of the example of the Western nations, but by abolition of the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized state of it with a strong presidency force.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in view of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, its country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and has long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional vacuum plants are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; besides fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country that was undermined by 30 years of war, State control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumour was spread that Afghanistan possessed enormous soil treasures.
This further strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only on the spot to empower themselves.
Without energy to process the iron or copper herb on site, or without means of transport for export over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the copper mine of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) have made their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, reconstitute normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French battle forces was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girls and boysymnasia, Institute of French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural field, supporting the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which has been suspended in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures for the renovation of agriculture in dozens of mountain doors and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to win the "herds and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of compatibility of aids and offensive actions.
These work, for which numerous local workers were required, have helped to undermine the resurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural resources.
What souvenir do we leave after military expenditure of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys at a height of more than 2,000 metres.
In the message, dozens of written requests of small agricultural projects have been received from municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
In order to liberate farmers from the rebellion led by foreign groups, what they wish to say, the continuation of smaller, well-controlled and directly related civil aid to their favour would be necessary.
A Constitution with the Brechstange in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt has been divided more than ever with regard to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily gives him the unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on a map.
To surprise everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt its final version on the next day.
Just one week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months to complete his work.
Egypt has now been based for nearly two years on a preliminary, multiple-changed text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal interchange.
This new initiative has only ensured a even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "run the right with feet".
It is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to speed up the transitional process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that forces the brothers to refrain from their efforts to explain the text to the Egyptians section for section.
For the President, it is also a way of finding its public and democratic legitimacy again, while the protest is swept throughout the country.
After confirmation in an interview with the American Week View Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
In particular, the Egyptian people with this rejection of an excessive vote will be put an ultimatum: "You either agree for my draft or I preserve the unlimited power," the latter would supposedly end after the Constitution had adopted.
85 islamist members of this Constitutional Assembly have adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have turned away because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views into effect.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve the decision-making capacity yesterday morning, 11 persons, alternate members, were added.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
Moreover, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference in the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, as some members of the body believed that the penalty of the Constitutional Assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was still adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which took all the attention, remains the same as that of the Constitution of 1971 and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of justice".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a more strict application possible.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
The liberals, who only view this as a propagatory strike, respond to "skin-health".
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place on other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in mind, which acknowledges an advisory function at the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the review of conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the people who are invited to an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
The first signs of the theocracy can be seen here."
The fears of the liberals are also attained by the fact that the next council of this university is likely to be far less gentle than the present.
"There is not a real religious commitment to be seen.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
The majority of lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained partly in the French system," stressed Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, "that there can be a ambiguity with regard to Article 220, as the terms used are rejected from the religious vocabulary.
It refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamian lawsuit, Note d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised in which far as civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized because of the extensive powers he has granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another dispute: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the request of the military, the examination of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations called for to defend human rights.
The latter also communicate their fears regarding the text they consider as threatening freedom.
The existence of blasphemia is maintained, and offenses are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article refers to the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef by Human Rights Watch.
They believe that the only positive point is the ban on torture by Article 36.
This word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to speak on television yesterday night, demonstrations were planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will catch up on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect sacred places, the world's navel and a sea of solar
The Promised Land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and unaffected nature.
AIF mentions the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Promote the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It says that all those who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus accomplished his miracle: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding celebration, walking on the water, breathing of the seastorm and fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most sanctuaries are found in Jerusalem.
The believers go here the path of suffering or the crossroads of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The way begins at the Roman Festival Antonia, the Pretorium where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the grave church on Mount Golgotha, where the crossing site, the salvation stone and the grave of Jesus are located.
Here is, according to Christian opinion, the world’s navel, which symbolizes the rescue of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is the place where a Christian legend grew from which the cross was made for the crossing of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the wall of complaints, the rest of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, there, people of different religions leave notes with desires that will then be fulfilled.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret hiding from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 C.E.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains in 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountainsteigers can reach the ruins of their own strength.
Everyone else brings an air trail to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, 1600 to 2040 meters of height is the famous ski area Hermon, in which it draws numerous tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you get there with a shuttle bus.
The skipists have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the mountain summit.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
On just one trip, not all of them can be checked.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be given a visit.
Below is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parlament).
There, old Qumran handwritings or scrolls from the Dead Sea, found in rock hulls in the Judean desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological explosions.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There the collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is issued.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which has several pillars of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathing servants at the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum leaders or souvenir shops.
The entry is free and donations are in principle rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum and Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters of history.
The most influential department is the monument for the children, which was built for the memory of the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When you enter the room, there is total darkness.
Stars screw.
And the names of the Jewish children and of the lands in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do Something for Health
The three main recreation areas of Israel are on the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, delfinarians and oceanarians.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathing throughout the year.
By the way, this unusual sea with a position of 417 meters below the sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
His turkey blue water has a high salt content and thereby wears even non-swimers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is incredibly beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt soles) and healing slam as well as for the treatment of skin inflammations, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and for the relief of stressed nerves.
touching the Mysteries of the Ancient
These secrets are the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous seaway, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia linked together.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists are happy to swallow through the narrow gases named by star marks.
Fortuna is to be the legend after all those who touch the walls in the street with their star mark.
In Jaffa you can meet newly painted couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stretch through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crossritters.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theatre, evening concerts and operas are listed today.
Watchlist for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English knowledge: About 30% of the Israeli speak Russian.
The money in the journey is rather not taken in euros, but in dollars that can simply be switched to shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 Shekel).
In the city you are mostly coming forward with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway train and in Haifa the only subway line of the country with six stations connecting the subtle with the upper city.
Exactly, it's a underground standway.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, which are sufficient for a journey up to 1.5 hours, regardless of the means of transport.
According to Jewish tradition, Israel will take place on Saturday the Sabbath.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and businesses are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the working week starts.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only cosmetic food is served, which excludes pigmeat, sea products, fish without shoes and foods containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hammer and beef, soups and deserts (prepared with cocos milk), traditional Jewish Humus paste, different sosses, freed balls of pirated beans and herbs (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no straining dogs in the streets of Israel's cities.
There are many well-equipped cats for that, who struck through the streets cozy and unhealthy.
Even in the evening, you see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats may have experienced places and don't say no to delicious lands.
Car rental depending on the brand costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $ 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance also costs 15 dollars per day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Entry cards for museums cost 30 shekel in cut.
In numbers
In 2012 more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventures and retirement seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 Thousands of Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, which corresponds to a 51% increase in the comparison period in 2010, before the suspension of the visa obligation on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Members and citizens discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with false certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of families living in the home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force, which, according to each working migrant, has to carry out a test which confirms the knowledge of the Russian language.
This scheme is currently only applicable to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail.
However, tests, according to the Federal Migration Authority, are to be required for all host workers in the future.
Not only language tests, but also tests must be put into Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the receipt and the extension of the working permit.
Exceptions only apply to citizens from countries in which the Russian official language is.
Similarly, those who received their training certificates and diplomas before the USSR's destruction in 1991 are excluded from this law.
Purpose, problem and protection of rights
The total of the auditors will be under the Ethiopian of the Puschkin Institute of Russian language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can test the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to initiate the tests was supported by the Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
On the other hand, before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens asked several times: What does the whole thing actually bring?
What changes brings the regulation to provide language skills for both the Russians and the host workers?
Especially, as speakers of the Migration Authority, it is to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of labour migrant rights," says the director of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must already be protected from their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers at 90%.
Immigrants are faced with problems without occupation, education, language skills and medical examination.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language knowledge will necessarily meet people with evil intentions, which will put him under the pretext of help into a dark, narrow barrack, where he will endure without food and documents with dozens of his equal months and will be created 12 to 14 hours a day.
We reach many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home the one will be promised to you, and when you arrive you will be betrayed, their passports will be reduced and not receive the promised wage," confirms the head of the head of the Labour Migration Administration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't smuggle, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of Central Asian Republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they are not only able to dominate the language of the country of destination but also to express themselves in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, rather than the evil: only a few Turkmen, Usbeks and Tadschikhes can only afford a reasonable basic education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children but to buy them decent clothing, shoes and school matter.
As a teenager, these children will immediately take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and disadvantaged."
Civil lawers emphasize the following important aspect in relation to the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to leave the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
At the same time, most of the guest workers continue to remain illegal in Russia.
"Happy welcome" or "Access to Unauthorised"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic barriers and, of course, the language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
False registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The Russian police staff know that our documents are mostly faked and we are not registered, and then there are cases of pressure.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajike Umed Huschkadamov expresses himself to journalists.
"Don't scare costs for false papers"
Already the day the law entered into force proved that not only the registration documents of the migrants could be fake.
Some false certificates that confirm the completion of the language test have already been deployed by the Federal Migration Authority's employees.
The fake papers were printed with a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to save the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubels.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: it costs a work migrant three thousand rubels.
The main direct task of protecting the system from corruption is to ensure that the certificates are not easily purchased, both officials and citizens are agreed.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test for the first time that they receive time for a language basis course.
In addition, newcomers without language knowledge are offered places in areas where no active understanding is necessary with people.
Internal Ministry ignores illegal weapons market
The proportion of legal weapons in crimes is extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to intensify the weapons law for private arms owners.
The authorities respond to recent events: injured in shooting on weddings and seven deaths during the Moscow Lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to ban carrying non-death weapons in the public and raise the age for the possession of guns from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has supported the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the weapons law will be tabled soon in Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "attraction of screws".
On the Internet, an open letter was published, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - require the authorities to take away from "sinless distortions".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal, Wasily Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes were committed with the application of registered weapons during the six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand defects were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a sharpening of the law for private arms owners of criminals will not prevent being used on the black market.
Nowadays, according to Moscow, the authors can find any possible weapon for little money.
At the same time, the Ministry of Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factory to the officers
The weapons come across several channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who was working in the Ministry of Education and General Staff ten years.
Screenshot of a site that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fight in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons come to be stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police arms chambers and directly by the criminal prosecutors.
Other illegally sold weapons originate from military arms camps.
In many military camps, explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that some of the cases were burning to consume the lack of weapons," says the former military citizen.
According to Baranez, a contribution to the black market also contributes to arms manufacturers.
"Today there are countless private arms mills that do not stand the international competition and therefore swallow the weapons on the black market, for example in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggle.
Especially many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kirgisia.
"There is a own, sometimes craft production and a mafia that organizes the smuggle," explains the former military citizen.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was written by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available data on weapons portals.
The majority of the illegal weapons, according to the army and the law enforcement authorities, originate to the mediators.
Half of all the weapons on the black market are thereby through the "Sheet of Responsibles who have come to do with weapons in their work," says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons are from conflict areas, 14% return to thiefs in arms production, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant of a gun store that does not want to be called namely assured that weapons found in the case of illegal excavations, no one has been buying for a long time since they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more often that traders get the aftersheet in a gun camp.
A gun, for example a gun of type TT, is purchased over a fanry.
The gun is issued and handed over by the gun.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says
"The police are, of course, aware of everything and therefore, if they cannot comply with the plan to detect crimes, regularly carry out control purchases in traders offering illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"As in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers are most frequently about familiar one another.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested me to come to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me who brought me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the gun I first learned there

"To get a gun, I need a acquaintance who has contact," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders on the markets, but there you have to go and make a code like "from Iwan Ivanovitsch, which makes it clear that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even coming to some beating rings about a friend I trust.
He also delivers the stroke rings to me because he knows I don't feed him.
New people are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military citizen Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
The schemes have not changed according to him.
He received a photo album in which "all possible" was pictured.
"I felt like in the luxury store," remembers the military citizen.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
I as a potential customer buy not just, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target disc.
"I can shoot there, and if I'm convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we'll negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontaktes", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are required or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," says the advertisement on the "Buy gun or gun" website.
There users give up your orders and ask inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Naturally without license", user asks "Iwan" (statically quoted).
"Buy a TT. Moscow" is the Lakonic question of "Fedorenkow".
The federal security service has recently switched numerous web pages, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the service to the network.
People come like hungry fish when feeding and then land in Siberia and allow carbon to be cast
Military commentary and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered in abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The chargers accept the orders.
The buyer overcomes the money via a banking machine.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the gun," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can finally go out empty and come behind grids if you place a request on a website.
The federal security service has recently switched numerous web pages, and buyers who want to purchase weapons go to the service to the network.
"The people come as hungry fish in feeding and then land in the Siberian labour camp and may shove coal," he says.
A Makarow for 100 US dollars
According to experts, when buying illegal guns, prices from 100 to 900 US dollars are expected.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun from the type of Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military arms camps by overseers in the middle range.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Interior, the number of delicts with illegal weapons in all Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9% during the period January to October 2011, while the number of discovered cases of steel and pressure in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
Every fourth US-American youth sits at some point behind the Mc Donald's box
In recent days there have been massive protests in the United States against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chickens.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests will swell further or whether they will get out of the air soon.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several non-profit organisations on the left.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this industry has hardly been organised in the field of trade.
46 cents a year?
The protests started last week after thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, where sales took place in the United States, which attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to handmengs.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, put their work down and struck together with trade unions and left activists branches of the chain, whose target group is low and medium income.
Walmart sells all products, from windling over hunting guns and car batteries to dust cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart-filials is in the cut between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the low-payed Walmart workers buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the product only so cheap because the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complains about severe working conditions, such as missing gabel stackers or hand scanners.
The participants of the protest on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anxiety that the contribution to the operating health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart co-worker who deserves 9.5 US dollars the hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley prove that if the company increases the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
These are about 1,1% more than they now spend for wages.
If Walmart would put the wage increases completely on the customers, every purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
This would be more expenditure of only $12.39 per year compared to today.
Advocates of Walmart are pleased to note that only in nine states there were protests and that they did not cover any losses to the company.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in his store from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight, and Walmart sold about 5000 items per second during this period.
Overall, the Walmart boxes carried out nearly 100 million transactions on the "Black Friday".
The speaker of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-handed Huffington Post that in total, "less than five" Walmart employees had set down the work and the protest action was only "a further PR-trick" of the union organized by the protesters.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal, however, was not Walmart-filials (which are not desirable in this advanced city and are therefore inexisting so far), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sells billions of portions, and yet they don't give you sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage is 7.25 dollars per hour according to federal legislation and New York legislation.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage will be increased steadily, but not too strong, and in average their simple employees in New York 8,90 US dollars will receive the hour.
Less than she deserves nobody in this expensive city.
As it is possible to get out of New York with so little money, I can't understand.
There was once a time when nearly a quarter of all US youths stood behind the thesis after school at McDonald's, but the youths still lived with their parents.
A few of them saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, at interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to get out of this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, whose author notes it is unanimous to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests, who started on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashier and cooking of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which corresponds to more than a double of the present minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US-American Law forbids the management of the company to stand in the way of this goal and to reminde or dismiss trade unions members.
On the other hand, the management does not make it easy for them.
However, the creation of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
There were strong protests this day also before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The peak of the protests was a congregation on the afternoon before McDonald's at the Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet they don't give you sick days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should jointly support fast-food employees so that they can receive a fair reward and achieve the economic prosperity each New Yorker deserves!".
According to New York Times, this was the largest action of her kind in the history of the U.S. fast-food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on the site, of whom there are not all in the fast-food industry in which tens of thousands are working in New York.
Not yet to see if the radio of this protest will mobilise whole masses.
"The brain can only be moderately overlisted"
The theme of the extended reality, popular with adherents of modern technologies, is usually observed by the lens of a special glass in recent times.
In the summer, Google first presented a working model at his annual conference, then announced in November that Microsoft had also registered an appropriate patent.
In conversation with the leader of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the scientists of the company.
It insists on the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with just hands and creating virtual spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group operates.
- We are dealing with the interaction of humans and machines, but we want to expand the limits of this interaction.
Until now, mankind has remained mostly in the phase in which pixels are worked on flat screens, which sometimes are also touched.
However, we want to predict 5-10 years and predict the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since all are interested in motion control.
- What else do we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many things are still playing on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this, working on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more fascinating.
However, it is necessary that not only the user but also its environment be recognised.
Then we could complement the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid Virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overestimated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because it does not always want to inform all the surroundings about their actions and intentions.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but every one in its particular nest.
For example, we worked in the field of control of objects on public places at a project where we experimented with short and tight, instead of with inviting gestures.
The gestures were recorded not by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could be reduced theoretically to the size of a bracelet clock.
However, the future as a whole belongs to mixed types of control, such as geography and language.
- How?
We would ask you, for example, to reach this sprudeldosis?
They say it and at the same time describe it.
- Normally I'm just saying it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognize.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at the respective time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it's about mutual approximation.
I think that we will have to work mainly in the development of new sensor types in the next time, which enables us to clarify people's reactions more accurately.
For example, this can be laser sensors, as they offer a good resolution in the depth, which is very important.
- What requirements do you make from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?
Does it lack resolution, depth or something else?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main causes are not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
All current technologies are not good enough for us, since the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of man are extremely dynamic and openly said, the present 30 fps are too little especially for gestures.
In our laboratory in Redmond, Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with a regular processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with the current commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
For my work I needed such a device, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared sender and the second is a recipient for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a common RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Beautiful would be a flexible, kinect-like system, where we could play with different camera reliefs to find out how this helps us in the three-dimensional detection of a position.
- If I remember very much, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that with regard to the use of the technology of the extended reality in everyday life, the glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to keep a smartphone in the collected hand on the way, but I think: The most great variant would be a "changing" extended reality where we could switch through a cloud from the glasses to the smartphone,
The glass is a personal gadget and it lies in its strength (Privates can only see you), but at the same time also its weakness, because an extended reality through glass prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a while that the manipulation of virtual hologframes in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man but also normally available.
There is a problem that critics often point to this idea: there is no sensible reaction!
The hands don't feel at all!
What answers do your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often speak that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in interaction between human and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactical perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She takes great care of pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "pictures in the air" some hand firms, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams in a particular point where the finger is located, a feeling that is still so weak as if someone pushed over the handballs.
There are also bands for the handle that affect the nerve ends in the fingers, including that is a potential direction.
- Did you try to overlift the brain?
You think it feels what it should feel if it sees something right now?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried.
Here is another task that we will have to fight with for a long time, namely a person who is physically in a closed room, to believe that he is in an open, practically infinite space instead; here we work on concepts with running bands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms and large balls.
Until now, the brain can only be moderately overflowed, and many years in front of us are still working.
Especially this makes the work in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: We are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", which is dedicated to city residents who form the Avantgarde of Art and Culture.
On the list read already high-level representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose success goes beyond the city's borders and often finds recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagante artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the redly dressed beards, which you may meet at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene races or on disguise.
Wherever the pictures are displayed by Kirill Miller, they attract large human masss.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city and embarrassses his fellow citizens in the face by his presence on the street and makes them feel good.
Shortly, he took a spinor and became Petersburg's rotor player, since he finally felt ready for this difficult role with regard to his artist's, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not in yellow or turkish in the city?
I picked the color Red as a fashion designer, which deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, all that differs from the Graunorm calls out aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Newskij Cultural Palace where my work was issued.
I realized I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters ended then, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friendly with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonwschina", from which "Puschkinskaja 10" was created, and then the end was only once.
It draws me to theatre, fashion, music, actually to everything, except literature.
It was important for me to stand at the centre of Petersburg culture where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in Puschkinskaja 10, and there was a musical artistic club for the Bohemia, the house of the Petersburger Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how sneur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Snur and his friends sang simple songs to playback, wearing close tricks, and also belonged to the composer Igor Wdowin, who is a composer today.
When the group began to play live, it became from her "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg managed many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he learned with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also originates from the art clinic.
Our employees and guests went there.
I am a hero of the last century when culture meant something more.
In 2000, there was a survey in the press about the award of "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and so I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Today it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an insignificant style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was social, but now it hurts and fears to be like that.
In a clown, all this blurs and loses his tragedy.
I love the Great, and I have great ideas.
For example, let us ride the world by prescribeing that everyone has to dress completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothing and is oriented to the outer and not to the inside of man.
But maybe you shouldn't give the hand to a man, but you should spit it into your face.
The deception disappears by dressing.
We've recently seen you in the role of the city's turning orgel player.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art must be cautious, considerate and smiling.
We see the destruction of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar notes that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 trailers.
- At Stas Michailow's appearances, there are several thousands!
- Come to him abandoned women, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand come, so there is less management, money, and everything goes to ruin.
I have trailers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not destroy the achievement.
In my youth, I painted such pictures, which were even in a series of works of Falk and Larionow with a collector.
I started with pictures that normally come to the end of the career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It says: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consument has no culture at all, that's something quite different.
I am a man of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said: "Culture's servants."
But not everyone of them can deal with culture.
The real ceremony was different, because the ceremony may not have understood much about culture, but they understood that proper experts are necessary.
There are currently good consultants in Moscow.
In Petersburg we have those who could be experts, but they are locked up the way, as high-level experts need to evaluate the first ones correctly and make them free.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not all accept contemporary art and therefore some painters need to find other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; in Moscow there is a lot more culture and a corresponding nutrition floor.
Art can only grow hard on our stones.
We need a cultural nutrition ground, because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's much less.
Art must be modern again, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is financed from St. Petersburg grants
Birth in the World Room
Earth in danger.
Heating or collapsing with killer steroids.
Caravans of spaceships with earthly residents on board are looking for a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the important question is how we can continue to grow in gravitylessness or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least live hypothetic.
"Mors and Venus," says the scientist of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on the Mars are relatively life-friendly, the surface of the Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible in a large height or in the curriculum of Venus, i.e. in everything.
The question of reproduction in all was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Experiments with plants were carried out before half a century before.
The fourth generation of hereditary inheritances in the Orbit did not differ in the least of the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precisely from small fruit flyes (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, Wachtleier was sent to the world room to explore the effects of gravity on embryo development.
It develops a very normal chicken.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chicken needs to find stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and begin to move," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without a solid underground, the chicks crossed wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns stumbled completely.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they simply died.
"Two times we let the chicks go and then put the whole thing in, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Wladimir Sykew says to the failed experiment with the chicks in all.
The last fragrance with animals fled into the orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only equal sex species.
There was a experiment with rats that were already dispatched into all.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"It was just with the biosatellites, but again it was only a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," says Wladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space Councils received an increase.
The problem of reproduction directly in the space could not be solved until now.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are scattered from their natural habitat can simply not follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, man could be the principle.
The homo sapiens is too abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
These experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying to all for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereschkowa.
The most valuable humanity has is the female organism.
Our moor fled away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Does it surrender the space flight?
Will she be able to produce a child after this flight?
"No one finally answered this question," says Spaceveteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonautine, Valentina Tereschkowa, lived a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also cosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in All, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even worked outside the space vehicle, lived a son.
Anyway, there's a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy rear.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying to the Orbit," Cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow concludes, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity needs to look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the producing of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory in the Cosmonauts Preparation Centre is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a sweating state the cosmonauts win the routine for work in the open space.
The water represents the weakness of gravity.
Even if adults feel water pleasant, it is a foreign environment, but infants feel water as a natural element.
It's as if the little Ichtyanders would testify that life on the land came out of the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that a child is in the abdomen of the mother in the fruit water about 9 months and that it can then be easier to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, as from birth to first swimming just two weeks passes.
"It's too little time to forget something," says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
Thus, while for a newborn child the gravity is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of gravity, abdominal and occupy muscles are rapidly reduced and thereby also decreases the ability to press the child out.
All right, let's handle this by the birth-initiatory tool.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to press the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the non-essential question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling education, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a stress suit in the orbit like an adult to train.
He will simply miss what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the creation of a disabled, a totally inappropriate person," predicts the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the world is mere theory.
But at some time it will be reality when the earthly inhabitants in their spaceships break up to a remote planet that will be the home for their descendants born in all.
NKÚ-Chapter: Control of the Black System failed by misleading politics
In connection with public contracts, the Czech Republic has good controls and adequate laws, but fall within their application.
In the discussion for Aktuálně.cz, this is what the Vice-President of the Highest Control Office (Newvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala, says.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is not the case with us, I think," comments Kala on the current situation.
A similar result seems to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he suggests the position of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called black system.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS wouldn't offend the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is legally forbidden, then it cannot be simply the President of the Government, and the control office, whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law, hinders in its activity," states Kala.
At the meeting of the Committee on Control of the Chamber of Members, you spoke of a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public procurement were compared.
What was the matter concretely?
This is a parallel examination with which we have started about two years ago.
Simplely, it is about the European Legislative to determine how public orders should be handled, which builds on national legislation and, finally, there is the actual practical application.
All of this we have compared with each other, and even though the test has not been completed, we have been able to find extremely interesting differences. Generally, the laws may even be a little more "strenger and more perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules again and again, and that the actual application of law must also be examined.
How can the project help you? What is the result for you from this project?
Just such a common control could help us to stop trying to achieve perfection of laws and to reduce and evacuate thresholds if this apparently does not have a very positive effect.
Economy means to acquire a matter at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and exclude illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we also achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even so that we only burden the system in this way with excessive "pair crawl" and those looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to use the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems of the practical implementation of the Czech Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here as our NKU, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German pendant is the NKÚ of the Federal Accounting Court, which is similar to us and also has a college, which is just a little different, but in principle both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a state, i.e. that these accounts are also available in each of the Bundesländer - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds which corresponds to our state resources.
Public resources managed by the districts and communities are subject to the control of national accounting stations.
As for German legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific information, but in some respect, Germany is often referred to as an example, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Maybe this is because the testers are better there?
This certainly not, but as I said, I don't like such comparisons.
It should also be noted that those countries that are an example for us also have to fight with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have anything about cooperation with our authority, wouldn't they?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what significance did your authority have for the novellation of the contract law, do you already feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this Novelle is only a short time in force, it does not have any effect on our tests until now.
Since our controls take place afterwards, we have to expect a certain delay here.
We have so far experienced more impacts in future controls in the preparatory phase - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Recovering risks of ineconomy" and examined and analysed with this almost 14,000 public contracts - the changes will naturally affect, since the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, including.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hopes that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem can arise that the rules will be "strengiger" and cannot be met anymore.
Already under the previous rules, the persons undergoing a review against the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of the Regional Policy, the Regional Council) are accountable for that any non-compliance with the law of granting is equivalent to a violation of the budgetary discipline.
Is it, then, useful to make the law even more strict?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
Let's first say which way is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS wouldn't ease the entrepreneurs with the controls of the so-called black system - what exactly does that mean?
Is the Black System now prohibited or permitted?
A law must have its validity, and if something is legally forbidden, then it cannot simply come to the President of the Government, and the control office whose duty is now the control of compliance with the law is obliged to impede in its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow it," but he cannot say that we do as if nothing would be.
The contract law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the tenderer is excluded with the best offer alone due to form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I believe is missing in us.
On the streets there are single ice creams, but mostly they are dry.
In the roads of the Czech Republic, there are some snow and ice flats.
However, most of the roads are well-accessible, sometimes increased caution is required.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets were well accessible to this morning, unisolated snow and ice sleeves.
The temperatures lower to -5 to -10 °C, it is supposed to be warmer over the day.
In the region it is no longer cutting, and in the deeper heights it remains just a thin snow cover.
However, on the chambers of the Erzberg are about 30 cm snow.
According to the district road guard, the vision of Nebel was limited.
The Quick Road R6 and the roadways of the first road class in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is given, for example, to bridges at which the trains sometimes are required and smooth.
All roads of the second and third road class, including mountain roads, are also available.
However, on these roads there remains gradually required or expired snowrests.
In particular, increased attention is therefore needed in the higher situations.
Bezirke Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some streets East Bømens there is a danger of ice flats, in higher locations and in the mountains is sometimes still on the streets a expired snow layer, and the road and motorway direction is communicated on their websites.
The street championships warn drivers from ice creams, which can occur especially in higher locations in the district of Pardubice.
For ice cream, it can be made especially on roadways of the second and third road class in the circles of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in Svitavy are treated chemically.
Snow is especially located on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické Hory Mountains.
A expired snow layer is located on the roads of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
Today, it is mainly sunny or hot, and it remains largely free of charge.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it wears a weak wind.
Bezier Pilsen
The roads in the district of Pilsen are well accessible today, but local attention is required, and the roads should be adapted to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it had cut before and the temperatures then fell, it can come to ice flats on the streets.
Locally, however, the vision will improve in the course of the day.
These data are derived from the district street championships.
The motorway D5 is practically fully accessible, however, increased attention is recommended by road championships between the 80. and the 131. kilometre.
The motorways of the first class are mainly dry but frozen.
However, in the south of the circles of Pilsen and Tachov, it can occasionally get ice flames.
The trails of the second and third road class are moisture, and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also applicable here.
The drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequent roads in the area of Bohemerwald.
Olomouc District
Today, with snow math, drivers who are on their way towards the heights in the district of Olomouc.
After the use of straw vehicles, snow matsch remains on the pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snow drives forced the street championships to use, in the Šumperk circle, according to the road management, about 3 cm new snow fell.
In the other areas of the district, the railways are mostly unlimited.
"In the circle Šumperk remains in the heights still snowrests.
On the pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to count snowmatsch in the direction of Jeseník," said a staff member of the road management Šumperk today toward the Agency ČTK.
Her colleagues in Jeseník's circle also had to get out in the night, according to their data, the roads are free and wet to the heights after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc circle, the roads are unlimited, but in the Šternberk circle, the drivers must be careful to drive in forest sections, as the roads are still moist.
District Ustí nad Labem, Liberec District
In northern rivers, road championships report a number of badly accessible road sections.
In addition to several sites with snow or ice cream, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is locked in the district Ústí n.K. according to the traffic police.
The temperatures also remain in deeper positions under zero, so that snow and ice are kept on the streets. From the low levels, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, no problems are reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disorders have been reported so far.
Ice flavours are reported in particular from the circle of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this in the night - daytime rain and smelting snow, night cloudless sky and frost.
From the main routes and from the road I/13 at the border of the Ustí and Liberec districts, bad transport conditions are reported.
The locking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to axes pressed from the snow load to the road.
Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think of taking place in less than a month of world destruction?
This is one of those catastrophic messages that we are so pleased to approach people.
With our band The Tap Tap we're more funny about saying that we're the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world downfall.
In December you also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world down.
Can you present the project to our readers?
This is a country-wide beneficiary event that we have planned for two years.
We want to use the Maya calendar's marketing potential, whose end is forecasted for 21 December at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place in Prague, Brno and Ostrava at the same time from 21:00 a.m.
The end of the concerts is to be in about the time at which the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone of 12 hours ahead of us.
Who's this idea from?
Originally well from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphicist Honza Augusta.
We do not only want to collect sufficiently positive energy to prevent the world’s destruction, but we would also like to think together with the public about the state in which we give this world once to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and key trailers against the world downfall, with which the people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap has also taken the so-called Hymne against the world down with the title "World down falling out".
Already today, the Hymne on YouTube is very popular. Will it also come to the beneficiary concerts?
Of course, at the end, provided that everything works and the world's destruction doesn't take place...
The hymne should be singed at the same time by all artists on all three concerts.
In addition, the hymns are transferred live in a direct switch by the Czech TV.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you get to cooperate with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech Culture scene, which involves the realization of many beneficiary events and concerts...
We strive to intensely involve these people in our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in cooperation with us and have fun.
What is the purpose of the relief of the concerts against the world’s destruction?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, where we have been working with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by teachers who help them with different recreational activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, we will create a own building, which we will then move into with this project.
On each concert several groups and artists appear.
What criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to draw up a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratesphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý are present.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May, we will appear for the first time at the Prague Spring, and we will also prepare an interesting program with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year we would also like to appear in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we were in the United States - would like to connect this with the appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small, until you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistics and organizational?
It's not as bad as it appears at the first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the baggage room. We also have to take a lot of instruments bags and other bags...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems until now, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I have sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your foreign trips, you have a comparison of how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were just in Russia witnessing that everything in the east is still in its beginnings.
Against Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. There it is still unusual if someone in the wheelchair alone is on the way in the city centre.
It is not even natural that you leave a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to point to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we need to pick up against the further developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're hanging in behind...
However, it is noted that improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the affected.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities can move independently in the public room, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not just common that there is a larger group of disabled people actively involved in social events, in which we are a little ahead with the band The Tap Tap to the West!
Respect in the public and accessibility is a matter, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our series, things will really begin to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly deliberate personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years, what has motivated you to create a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something intensely.
And since I'm musician myself and play, among other things, Saxofon, I have founded a music day together with a colleague.
Well, and with time, that is, as our modernist, Lá _a Angelovič, is pleasant to say, something is going out of control (smiling).
But did the band only become known in recent years, or do I miss?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us to work actively for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and you do not see this outward, your own performance is not in some sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also provide good teachers, high-quality devices, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I have felt the potential that you can handle things differently.
The show business often copies one of the other today.
This is logical in his way, as everything new is considered with caution and is accepted only after a long time.
There are just a few really unique things, and I dare to claim that Tap Tap belongs to it.
Of course, the first impression that the spectator has most is compassion; that is only naturally...
But this compassion is absolutely overflowing because people with disabilities are not alone and abandoned beings that we must regret.
It is people who can live a full-quality life and develop, provided they have the necessary means for it.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed something, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and also require a certain discipline.
But I think this is absolutely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have two times a week of sample, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, the enthusiasm loses quickly with many.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every band that works seriously and wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them have been from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Lá _a Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and wants to join, is always welcome to us.
Done at 21 a.m. on Thursday 20.12.2012, held on the day before the predicted world shutdown
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
At the end of the three events, the band The Tap Tap Tap will be connected to each other, and a common interpretation of the Hymne "World down falls out".
The aim of the concert is to set up funds for the establishment of a multifunctional disabled educational centre, which is to be created by STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, cards are available in the pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the space.
Last week Poland was taken up as the twentieth member of this space authority at a ministerial meeting of the Member States of the European Space Organisation ESA. Poland is the second member of the former Eastern Block (after Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
The way of Poland into the space began, of course, much earlier.
Already before World War II, Polish cosmos enthusiastics were engaged in space traffic, not always in understanding.
I remember here, for example, the presentation by A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, where the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Ingang to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) were cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important defender of astronomy and space traffic.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis, a globally recognised contribution to the development of space, was appreciated, among other things, by nameing one of the craters on the earthside side of the moon after it.
Already in 1925, a railway train was built in Poland for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the draisine.
The information about this is exclusively derived from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with raket-driven shots.
The research led the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents provided show that research has been carried out up to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then clearly interrupted by the invasion of the German army.
In 1937, the draft of a photo-electric hunting draket appeared in the special press of Ing. Rohoziński, and the following year the work of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky was published in the "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza".
Both projects focused on the military use of the rocket drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the preliminary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Comity Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, his work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskkie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is made in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for a space company.
At the time there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was not possible to see that the research of the space would have the future.
At its beginning in 1956, the Polish Space Society PTA tried to join the International Space Federation, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a regular member in autumn of 1956.
In the following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Vice-President of the International Federation for Space.
He had the office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has participated in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rockets (Rakieta Meteorologicczna), the first Polish Rakete for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first start took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not completely 5 kg.
Later, a improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in 1959 the Błłdów desert began flight tests with the two-level RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another level of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the Rakete RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for monitoring high winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was stopped.
Following the first missiles of type RM, the Meteor-1 rocket was developed in the years 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-level rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) of these rockets were developed, different from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with 0.4 litres of capacity, Meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km for all three types.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Meteor 2 rockets were developed in the Aerospace Institute, whose first flight tests started in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a 10 kg load to a height of about 60 km.
Then the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also important to mention Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which followed two years later the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites in the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court lifted the law on non-profit work.
This decision called for a vibrant discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
This is why the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with non-profit financial speculations.
Due to the great differences in the value of work (loans) there are price tensions.
Under this term, a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to compete in economic competition through imports of favourable goods by 'subjecting competition' to raise a greater market share and increase its profits.
In a large scale, this means that most companies should transfer their production to abroad or buy a favourable place, or give up their business. The result is a high unemployment rate in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thereby no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, it is necessary to increase public expenditure.
This situation continues to be strengthened by the fact that the Gentlemen are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus replace the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known so that concrete statistics are excessive in this place.
The unrespectful practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus bring foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own populations without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly expressed in amendments to applicable laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own population to accept the dictatorship of private capital in particular in the wage sector.
This is done by economic forces in the case of long-term unemployment, and by circumvention of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between poor and empire.
In Germany, for a few years, there have been public food delivery agencies for arms who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own work.
The number of people involved is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the State must increase its income until the minimum of the existence.
Such a scandal was also discovered in the case of auxiliary forces employed in the German Bundestag.
The savings measures of practically all EU southern countries will undoubtedly go beyond the same condition in which people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level (as it was in the 19th century) or for a hunger wage on the edge of society and hope that private investment capital will flow into the country at some time.
This is, of course, the question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty goes from one country to another; or capital remains all the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt or Africa, the workers are working for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to be excessive that the state cannot participate in its own economy with capital and that planning leads to economic disaster.
The private capital persists closely in its view that the State is not allowed to intervene in the economy.
But then you have to ask yourself whether the private capital does not influence the policy and thus lead the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a practically almighty lobby in all countries.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of corruption, mutual benefit, legislation in which practically everything is hard but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is so that a State Ministry lacks finances private, close to industry-related legal undertakings in order to develop legislative drafts.
These drafts of law will then be adopted in the Federal Day.
All violence then goes from the people, as it announces the Western Constitution, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Apparently, liberal democracies are currently in a situation, as they describe Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the times of Caesar and Pompeius: "The state has been devastated for a long time, and the officials have been occupied with violence.
Against smurf money, by illegal remedy of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unavoidably, and the people went to vote with already purchased voices" ... "People with character did not have a consul for offices, so that the state had no consul due to this defeat for eight months" ... "You really began to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a single rule, and that a strong man had to be chosen"... Appian thought of Pompeius, but the strong man was then then Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole rule.
As it is shown, today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the unrespectful preference of its own advantage without taking care of society's overall interests.
The private capital has not already been able to recognize and implement the benefit for the whole society from its nature.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who do not at least strive for deep reforms.
The cause of the emergence of fascism and communism must therefore be searched for in the unacceptable liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
From today's state, the destruction of these regimes in favour of liberal democracy can be considered as a certain pause in which the next round is already recorded.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites are faced with the potential losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnesses, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and newer history.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least no lasting.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systematic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state's capital participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society for the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"...that nothing originates from violence or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "...that we don't forget how violent we are" .
"If my sons didn't want to war, there would be no," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip there was, as always, a number of reactions.
The one stands behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians as terrorists; the others, again, support the Palestinians, argue with the Rassism of the Israeli State, with the international murder committed to the Palestinian Arabs, and call the state of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write about who is born in the current political situation in these repeated waves of the killer and who is victims; finally, the present inhabitants of Israel, including the self-administration areas, were born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
I am about to open the readers the view behind the scenes, the view of whom the 95 years of tension (called from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small spot land in the Middle East are especially served.
My thoughts are partly based on available historical facts, others are derived from these and come from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly affects the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of fighting power.
In every era we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne someone stood toward a predefined goal.
We must acknowledge that we live in a time when the world's riches are concentrated in the hand of less individuals, and that this concentration of money and its resulting power has not been created within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families is one particular that can be described as the head of the crawl (I don't know if anybody stands over them, but I don't dissolve this) - the Redhschilds.
It's not written much about her.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already purchased by the Rothschilds in the 90s of the 19th century to stop the connection of their name with high-criminal acts, in which the background was always the strengthening of their power, the increase of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or rest on them (in the event of the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were five countries, after the storm of Ghaddafis remained only four, while Russia in the meantime subjected its central bank to the Russian Government).
Anyone who tried to resist this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to release its own (speaking: state) banknotes and was murdered in 1865 in a theatre.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to cancel the FED - he was murdered in 1963; the MEP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to accuse FED for the release of the World Economic Crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global powers of the Rothschild led to the formation of a plan for the defeat of three world wars by Albert Pik, a 33-year-old Freimaurer, and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at removing the great monarchist states of Europe, and the second war should, in particular, break Britain's colonial rule, and the third war should reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a such number would provide for their comforts and luxury and would not consume so many resources), create universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the precursor) and eventually lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method that the group of the richest families with the roth shields work at the top is the solution to a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, so that crisiss like those caused by them in 1907 are not repeated).
After the murder of the Habsburg Thron Follower Ferdinand in Sarajevo managed to trigger the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Zaren Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economicly unfounded capitulation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zaren Empire, war was no longer necessary), then the resolution of the Central European Great Force of Austria-Ungarn.
In order to facilitate the Second World War, the bankers made a lasting conflict situation through politics by placing Germany with gigantic war reparations, creating the prerequisite armed masses, so that they had only had to rejoice to the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who offered the guilts designated and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should take the function of a fifth column and also took into account to develop the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschild initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement, where a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as a capital (Return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned created the condition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first collapses with the inhabited Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was from the chain of losriss where the international bankers had held him at first, or whether everything went according to plan, it is hard to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared for the Second World War by the Wars Reparations against Germany, the calling of the State of Israel represents the creation of the foundation of the third world war.
If the international bankers are able to settle this war, the Jewish people will be like the victim of the second world war in the front line, this time together with the Arabian and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (think of how the people are divided into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the desire of individuals and their striving for global power at the beginning?
There is a need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, are only making their own candidates to vote.
The present Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fazism-attractive, loyal international bankers, who are doing everything in order to open up a war with Iran, which, in view of Iran’s membership of the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly extend to a global conflict, and where, due to Iran’s control over the only two miles wide road of Hormus, over which 20% of the world’s oil supplys run, could become a destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockefellers from 1994: "The only thing we need is a all-consuming crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristokrates.
A world where every newborn is implanted a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes the little ones and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a sign on their right hand or on their forehead that no one can buy or sell, but he has the sign, name of the animal or number of his name.
Here is wisdom: whoever is understanding, he who considers the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
The film Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob occupied the US-American Embassy in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the delivery of the broken Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the patronate over his regime for decades.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - it couldn't afford to throw the shah on board because this would have damaged the confidence of her allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was not able to carry out the liberation of the hostiles in Iran, where the revolution in the setting up of a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy strike for the reputation of the United States, and the following fiasko in the violent attempt to liberate the giant made everything worse.
Finally, after 444 days after negotiations had been delivered by the Algerian Government, the diplomats were released.
The fate of the hostiles at home called out a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The debakel in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes a episode of this history, which described the United States a small part victory.
Just before the occupyment of the message, six messengers escaped.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
In cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the CIA succeeded in bringing refugees out of Iran, with an extravagant story helping them cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian paces as members of a film stage, which, as it were said, visited in the country rotation for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert for "exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order to be credible, articles on this film project appeared in specialist magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept long secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several film Genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic politician, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the history of a successful housepiece, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the voting levels in the film - on one side the documentary scenarios from Teheran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in the film recording of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and easily oversprinkled so.
And then there are still the scenes from the CIA central and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office floors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable restart of his career with this film.
From a ridiculous actor, he has become a respectable director, and as actor he is now no longer the target of ironical comments.
Argo is his third game film after the Krimi No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller City without grace (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks the first film that does not play in the local Boston of the director.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was part of the features that lifted the previous films of this director from the standard Hollywood.
However, Affleck also demonstrates this feeling in Argo, where Teheran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the input sequence of enlargement of the message is very impressive in their overview, and yet brings the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect is made by Affleck with his team, also in fictional scenes (the wrong film stack on a basar in Teheran).
Too much action in many places
The director also had to consider that the story really does not offer many exciting scenes in the film sense.
But with the small one he works quite successful, helping the reality sometimes, which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis on the Teheran airport is turned away from a phoneat in America, or the persecution hunting on the startway, works something artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide spread, which is due to the need to show too much action in many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures have deserved more space, and so they are not in the film with far away.
Afflecks film loses a bit of train power. It is a film that can be tracked with some interest, with the formation and the retro style that is remembered from the 70th years.
But he's just awakening a lot of enthusiasm.
However, as a reminder of a piece of life in some way and as a proof of how overwhelmed the ideas of the almighty and all-knowing secret services, it is sufficient.
Directives on the blown-up of air balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who is calling for an annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, decided this year to organise the competition "the most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"The recent EU plan to introduce a female percentage of 40% in the management of large European companies brought us to this idea," said Patrik Nacher, who cares for the organisation of this survey, compared with the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of the insurance tariffs for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed a benefit in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013," said later.
Among the controversial EU Regulations, among other things, the binding mixing of bioethanol into fuels that are naturally harmful, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazard, or the directive on the size of chickens that have become significantly more expensive in this year.
In the past, criticism also harvested the factual prohibition of the use of the term "Butter-up" or also the ban on sale for conventional glue bears.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU instrument often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose claims are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (for example, Czech Republic is currently trying to apply the demands of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobby interests also meant that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and that they should not show "currection anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it merely harmonised the unequal national standards that would impede trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have already been pointed out by the EU against the resistance of some countries, indicating that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the last year's EU Regulation, which, according to air balloons, must be provided with the indication that children under eight years may not blow up the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU called for an American study, which, according to air balloons, is the leading cause of kidnaping.
Similar restrictions are already applicable to children up to 14 years of age in the use of year-market breaks.
There are also Kuriose accidents at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive which concerns European officials themselves - everyone who is officially in the EU must not use the name of Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece and must say FYROM (Form Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server nominated, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, alongside the other absurdities, the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies in the field of a Member State.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food supplies that were allowed on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volume for fungi conserves, which threatened us with a high penalty.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or from the idea of granting funds for applications for funding.
These ideas were, of course, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by not having a sea.
We will apply for reimbursement in the EU," explained Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD in autumn 2004).
As a argument, he argued that the cereals were very high and the state stocks were overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since Czech Republic has another way to sea ports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us according to Palas.
Finally, the European Commission welcomed Czech Republic to organise an invitation to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries without access to the sea.
Funds for applications for grants offered to the municipalities to the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) and should be specifically funding for the establishment of payment applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exceptions
However, although regulations in Member States are slightly toward the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to improve the effectiveness and development of the European Union, some experts believe that they are more acknowledged.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also show the fact that, like other Member States in Brussels, Czech Republic must fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and not always win this struggle.
Although Czech Republic, after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, could defend the term "Olomoucké tvaržky", the inland room (Tuzemsky), whose tradition is back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename "Tuzemák".
The name of rum may only be used for products of sugar tube destillate, not for products of sugar beet.
The official list of products registered in the EU now appears in the society of the world-famous cheese species Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or Parmaschinnens, the Karlsbader Zwieback, carpens from Pohořelice and Třebo
There, with a EU brand, the pardubic liver cake or Hořicer rolls can be brushed.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how does it come to the idea of advertising the President's office?
I'm not about being Senator or President.
If everything would work without problems in our country, I wouldn't go anywhere.
But I can't see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, as thieves are walking freely around while people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But if I see something I don't like, I try to suggest a solution to change this.
And since I am over 40 years old, and independence and independence, I have no other way to influence things than to candidifier for the office of a Senator or the President.
In the Senate, you did it and then made yourself on the way to the castle.
Doesn't it turn your voters back?
I've been telling myself all the time that I'm going to take the fight around the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified this and said that if I was elected to the Senator, I would be entitled to the office of the President.
But my goal is not the function. The function is a tool that I can realize my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a strongest mandate.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we as a people in the kneep and in front of the television, but put down everyone who wants to change something.
This is the media that wants to rob your honor and who confuse the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was claimed to be a journalist or to be a consultant of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight around the castle you have taken up with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive asset statements of more than 20 million crowns.
You have to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make proposals for legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have worked for the guide to remain a free business, and this could be done.
The problem is small spiritual policy - if someone comes from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without castle thoughts and party dogs from every party.
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather right or left?
From the Czech point of view, I think people see me rather left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is totally unimportant.
For me, it's important that we go on.
I am not concerned whether someone belongs to the left or right camp; I want to connect the people.
I support every good solution in public, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You're miserable if someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm this by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to get closer to this.
This can be described as popularism for me, but all the proposals I have spoken of are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you only remain keywords.
And so you don't get far into politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed in exercising, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I have no other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side to achieve these goals.
As President, it would be no problem for me to call on the Presidents of Parliament to live on television to legally establish the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and lawyers.
And then the speakers would have to say why they reject this.
A strong personality indicating infringements can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President who was a deserve of public pressure.
I know that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with the policy and tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save Czech Republic.
I'm not a Savior.
I know that I can't reach anything alone, so I talked to a number of well-known personalities about whether they would not also want to candidirate for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who refused to work overload.
I also supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová, who discovered fraud in the trade in light heat oil.
I started my candidateship with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of the voters have not at all gone to the elections, and those who have gone have mostly chosen representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of Mayors and Heads of District.
Do you think about the creation of a own party?
I have not thought about it yet because I have no time to check the past of any potential party member, and I have not even the money for it.
I have not even money for the presidential campaign; on my transparent account, only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You are talking about asset statements, how do you look?
My private capacity is estimated to be about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property of 25 million, a apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, and a aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, worth about one million. And then I have a few million on the account.
By the way, Aston Martin was a child dream - James Bond always liked me as he was in the car, was galant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You're driving a Aston Martin, have a 60 million assets and don't have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but your own money you don't want to invest in it.
That's not just convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make guilt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't raise too much interest.
And I'm not obliged to contest the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is generally covered by my salary as senator.
But I couldn't live from senators alone; for example, I could not finance my son the English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to earn money, I wouldn't have been able to do anything for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your earnings?
Didn't you say you're going to go back these activities?
But this is not related to the amount of the salary.
As promised, I have partially withdrawn my activities.
For example, my supervisor will be the leader of the travel office in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live from something too.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and this is still the case.
However, as President, I would completely stop my businesses.
You can find the full conversation in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - the example of spikes and the recently built book mountain - 2 photos
"I find the building fun, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a Passant on the street edge.
And Stefan Spermon, a IT technician in a nearby large business, says, "But, it's beautiful, the house."
But I wonder why we need a booklet today.
Everyone has the Internet, iPad and e-books.
No person goes to one of these old style libraries today, isn't it?
Spikes, a hardly needed sleeping town in front of Rotterdam's gates, is a extraordinary record holder.
The 80,000 resident community shows the lowest education rate in all the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictional bridges represented on the eurocards as pretty pinched steel concrete miniatures.
The success of educational publicity remained limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the statistics Lord: a library has to come!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture office MVRDV, master of the magnificent bar charts and producers of funny, yes, often cynical buildings, took the matter with habitual patience and appeared to the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury was still darkening around and sucking with the axis, the freak Maas stacked his read-in companions of the size to a pyramid and finished his activistly undermined speech with the words: "Dear municipality!"
That's what he is, my proposal for the Bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros of expensive mountain has been shaken up.
It is part of a revitalisation project, including deep garage, supermarket, post and a few adjacent residential houses with a total of 50 apartments.
The bookberg was awarded in early November with the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the sightless small town retorte, which had no longer to offer until the date than a post-modern footganger zone and an incredible cottage, behind which white facades you would tend to suspect a molecular factory to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
But above all, research now has the first public culture in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: bookeldorado under oseglocke.
Although there is a lift that leads through the mountain massive, the true spatial and reading joys come to an end when the topography climbs.
The glazed interior is bright and conscious, the burned climbing floor and the elegant streets speak the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You're already watching out for parking banks, dogs and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the books are along the facade, and in the middle lies a large, dark space, which is mostly uncomfortable and unpersonal," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic space configuration on the head and stole the reading area from inside to outside.
The inside of the Bookberg is used: In the middle of the offices, internet library, chess club, environmental centre and house technology centres are located.
A special joy is the black books, which are once wall clothing, sometimes brushing, once stinging countries.
Optics, captics and smell are foreign.
Even meated architects and construction engineers shake the head of the unknown construction material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the town community of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And that is how we were thrown out of agriculture in a freshland farm one day.
For many years, a millimeter thin plastic flies has been used as root base in the Netherlands in planthouses and fields.
That's cheap and time-effective.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons, then it is mature for the locker waste.
For the library, the Vlies was pressed to four centimeters of thick plates for the first time in these quantities.
Under heating and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is colored into a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that smells a bit after new cars and a bit after sports shoes.
After 105 stages, you have reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long hiking, the literature café is rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch crokets and entoped ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but especially the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Giving for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a predecessory project in puncto ecology," says Trouborst.
Healed and cooled with soil heat.
Although the bookberg is under a glass crash, even in sunny days the sun appears only short in the inside.
The broad wooden fibres, crossing to the glass fibre, serve as a contamination and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The space climate is very pleasant.
The rest do full-automatic rollers.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skepticist from the IT industry, already waged the way to the new bookhouse.
Lisette Haid was there too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who describes the Buchenberg as the "last overwhelming soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to give a book from his personal stock.
First, the optical gaps in the library that is not yet fully recorded - currently 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept has come up.
The beams are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-learning library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, each inhabitant has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just a cirrh.
MVRDV has thus succeeded in the king's discipline called in the field of identity foundation.
Looks have written literature history.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally an approach to identity.
Szabo: "German must play a bigger role"
Germany voted in the vote on the entry into force of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert on US European relations, Berlin is thus balancing at a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians with the United Nations.
But then Berlin stayed.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
But now Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical to Israel.
During the resurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also rejected the vote in setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally transposed by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to have a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just turning its foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
Amazingly, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Thus, the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still working on their role, but they are on their way to a 'normal' foreign policy.
A foreign policy as they have France or the UK.
What does "normal" foreign policy mean, then, specifically from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to include positions independent of the United States or European partners in national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. by exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are at a certain degree different from those of the other major powers and therefore Germany needs to protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude of the Nahost conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
That is why it must be careful not to take the public, but also the elites, into the Arab countries.
That's a matter, in any case.
But I would not want to measure it too much weight, that is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the United States.
That's why I don't think this was a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
This might even be a matter of respect for Germany.
Because it signals that it must be taken seriously as an international player and its interests.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the other hand, the United States have clearly spoken for a veto.
Are there differences between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American internal policy, these variations have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama insecurely has quite much understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not even as large as they always appear.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so brightly enthusiastic by Netanjahus politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree closely with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other hand?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and instead have to drive things out of their own position.
They're just doing that with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future to push Europe into a European position.
This is, of course, not easy for Germany, even because of the relationship with Israel.
That has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the Germans are aware that they have to play an independentr role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player - wants Germany to take a major role at all?
Or does Germany still find the leadership difficult?
Germany is not used yet, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a bigger role, various anti-German feelings will be free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be receptive for various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the United States in European policy continues to decrease, but the EU does not fill at the moment of this vacuum, who else remains?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant to them and makes it much more unloved - c'est la vie!

"Market Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Thereafter, an official name registered in China is hidden, but nothing has to do with the company of origin.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the actual namegivers do not complain.
And even then it's not clear if they get right.
"It becomes more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer in Taylor Wessing, specialized in violations of protection in Fernost.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitations already have a few additional letters so that they can register their brands.
Thus, from Gucci is simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can enter Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports product manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a directory with registrations from the Brand Office in Beijing.
On September 14th, 2010, a Chinese company used to protect Zegna DF Puma's trade mark, an art name that also served at the Modehaus Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese World Champions are known in copying and injured intellectual property.
In the large cities there are multiple purchase houses that almost exclusively sell falsifications.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: In order of his clients, he is opposed to the official right of Chinese companies from the Brandenamt to use a name already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", an accompanying brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This is what women meant, who scream rich men.
Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is business harmful, you have to fight it," says Pattloch.
"The brand is watered, the sole setting disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial waste and the process costs of the sectors concerned go into the millions, especially in the case of expensive predecessors.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is a volume of EUR 15 billion in the third largest market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, the removal of dubios records in the brand register is difficult to reach and go into money.
Up to nine years, the procedure can move, with uncertain outcomes.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the Court rejected complaints because after the long term of the claimed name became "market reality".
If the complainant has pech, he even had to pay the plagiator money because he injured his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle is here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem similar to Mercedes star until today.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was suspended, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitations from Hong Kong and Singapore, which made the famous krocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing confesses that there was in 2010 for too small staff and space equipment.
Last year, however, the "note situation in the course of work has returned to normality".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed inquiries would have decreased by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 claims are still waiting for execution in the Office.
It costs a lot to get on the other hand
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million requests for trademark protection were received in CTMO, almost one third more than 2010.
This is a record and meant that China for the tenth time after each other brings the list of new applications around the world, the Authority informs.
This also applies to the stock of all valid brands, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were charged.
Simplifying this means that any registration in cut 1280 Yuan or 160 euros costs.
On the other hand, it is a lot of costs, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting a Chinese plagiator.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal production of imitated vehicle parts was increased.
However, the imitation continued to secure the Chinese rights at the Marke Freudenberg.
You failed to do so because in Germany family names could not be protected, Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trader also rejected the objection of the coins.
Although Freudenberg was right in the next two instances, the processor continues to fight until today.
You have to watch out at all.
Now the matter is in charge of the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionality of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely excessive and costs us much time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were hardly charged, the company archive had even had to review hundreds of years old documents in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg of the opposite offered an "high six-digit euro amount" for an appendix.
"Thereby you see how much this is worth us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in Fernost are even threatening to swallow back to Europe.
Well, then, if the immitators are safer for unprotected brands there.
Thus a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long quit the group, yet he could refrain from registration.
"You have to keep watch," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in businesses with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, rather, that foreigners should register "all things that are somehow protective even in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise this can become much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his brand drama, then you have to pay license fees for your own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the relevant segment.
World Food Day: Stamp, Sing, Help
In Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi - and Swaziland are happy with AIDS.
The history of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometres.
First there is the stamp: Cowboystiefel, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and gentle leppers are looking for the tact on the parket floor, finding it quickly.
One-two-three-five.
Then the voices of the singers slowly swell - old, bass, tenor, and sopran - push, tough, and persecute themselves.
And Feite Hopf, the 29-year-old Dirigent, lifts it out of his material shoes, when he brings them together with his pleasant wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi tests a new song.
The fifty singers have arrived, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetician to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each chorus voice has another text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Aid for Self Assistance
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, which estimates Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
Swaziland lives in 245000 Aidswaisen.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 Aidswaisen in the village of Esitjeni, the Association of Voices for Africa Paten found in Germany.
70 of them visit a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take a patch.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo centre.
Imbongi means to Zulu storytellers or also praisers.
The Bantu language can speak flowingly in this room, no one, but sing.
For nearly ten years, the choir has been exercising songs in this foreign language and brings them back from time to time where they originate: in the south of Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometres of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple leather and straw huts, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no more parents because they are the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, there is a small situation where Swaziland is sick: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumventions of male predominant skin, which proven to be half the infection risk, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than fifty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immune weakness virus in itself, to die with mid thirty is not rare.
On a common African journey in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but especially the imbongis saw many children on the streets, not only lacking parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school finish, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and allow him to have a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa", which has been almost professionally concerned with the AIDS children in Esitjeni.
Facts of sexually transmittable infections
What are the most important sexually transmittable diseases?
The bacterial STI includes Syphilis, Chlamydien and Tripper (Gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papilomavir, herpes genital or hepatitis.
Filzläuses and crats belong to the parasitary STI.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and Tripper are primarily occurring in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Coch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of all Syphilis cases reported in Germany are transferred by sexual contacts between men.
Iterosexual adults include chlamydiene infections, trichomonads, candidose (Pilz), trippers and human papilomavirs often occurring sexually transmittable diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults - yet about 20 percent of HIV new infections are from this group.
Chlamydiene infections occur much more frequent among young people than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, human papyllomavirs are common in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmittable diseases are reportable.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute of 1697 diseases, the number of Syphilis infections has been more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has decreased since 2007.
In 2011 there were some 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms show a gender’s disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital wounds, urination disorders, flushes, abdominal pain and bleeding or wars.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide a hundred percent protection.
For partly, inducers of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by smier infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular investigations especially in the case of frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STIs can be cured and avoided later consequences.
Through patents, donations and not least the gagens that the choir sings throughout Germany, some things come together.
"In total, we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the Association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and violent woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also cares for the father-in-laws to stay well, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the supporters of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 fathers, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children appear in their uniforms every day at a time to school.
Whoever has no one anymore comes to the protective house in Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as well as the two cookers who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has launched a neck school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American Health Organization PSI that many have been able to make a HIV test in the village.
This is not of course, because, as obviously, the disease is in the whole country, it is rather silent dead.
A King with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute Tabu," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, weird in a country where the King officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute Monarch Black Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamie instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this stately sanctioned lifestyle that the HI virus has spread so quickly over the past decades.
But also the many hiking workers carrying the virus through the country.
Free condomes are at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchanges, the Imbongi-Chor travels every two, three years together through South Africa and sings songs full of wheat, struggle spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, many still know on the southern tip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has already stolen some cruel border soldiers a few tears.
The trip always leads to Esitjeni where the singers visit their fathers.
Even if you hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Going to Esitjeni, there's the light," people say there.
And if you return the 8733 kilometres airline to Heidelberg, to the steaming singers in the sample room on the Bergheimer Street, you can see it shine there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Merkur.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although he is next to the sun, there are also frozen water, as is shown from three studies published on Thursday in the "Science" specialist magazine.
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the permanent shadow region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and perhaps up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that are hit on the watchure.
No one connects the found of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the messenger sun, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building stones of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Unavoided by the earth's citizens, suns, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of the world room.
From time to time, they send pictures to earth: small guck holes in infinite wides.
The picture comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who creates behind Neptune around the sun, Ceres is no "planet" after the 2006 International Astronomic Union's new definition.
This scenario of an infrared recording of the top-telescope shows a "Family portrait" of uncounted star generations: The oldest stars are to be seen as blue points, more difficult to identify are the pink-coloured "newborns" in the Star Circle Hall.
This star-founding region - called unromantic W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope topr in the star image Cassiopeia, in a distance of 6500 light years.
This shilling glow of a dying star has taken the top-telescope of the Nasa.
The Donut-shaped ring consists of material that threw the star out in the death process.
In the huge Trifid Nebel, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars come from gas and dust.
The top-telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the Galactic Birthstube.
The Plejaden-Stars Hope, also called "The seven sisters", can be seen at night with the mere eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebel looks at this infrared photo to the viewer.
It is 700 light years away from the Aquarius star image.
His similarity with an earthly continent brought this noble the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the top-telescope.
Saturn and his rings: as these have been created, is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn-Monde, which disappeared spurlessly 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and sharpest recordings of the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxie
Depending on coloring, spiral galaxies will be recorded into true artworks.
The recording published by the European Southern Guard shows the thousands of light-years Trifid-nebel in the star image Protective.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (threely divided, three-pieced), as dark dust stripes the glowing heart of the star-born place.
In the star image Slangenträger, astronomers have photographed the premises of a cosmic caram company: 400 million light years away from the earth breed the cores of two melting galaxies and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Who does not lie on technical shortcomings, he may call her at her nickname southern fire wheel.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a cut from the Irisnebel in the star image of Kepheus.
The 1400 light-year noble consists of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than usual house dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took up the Hubble space telescope for the Nasa.
The bigger spiral galaxy calls scientists UGC 1810.
In this starnnabel is the brightest group of young stars of our Milk Street.
The stars are always producing new youngsters.
Also these star clouds, connected with the roasting nebula, brings on-goingly new baby stars - 5,000 light years away from the earth.
In this bright lighting galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but just gas.
Researchers suspect that he was only created shortly after the Urknall when it was primarily found in the universe hydrogen.
Our insights into all: The main telescopes
The telescope was supposed to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei took it a year later for star observation.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become increasingly deeper - and the insights they provide.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale-Telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest remote tube in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The Great Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows views into the all straight over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, he reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the favourable construction mode: the telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
His speciality: the high light collective power.
Because this is enough - despite a relatively low mirror diameter - to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers will hear all from outside signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), each computer owner can help by providing calculator performance.
Look at the observatory of the European Star Watch Tower (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all honor.
With its total four mirrors, the remote tube can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirrors are to include 42 meters - and are composed of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
However, pictures are expected at the earliest 2018.
By 2007, the two keck-telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They offer equally two mirrors with a average of 10 meters.
The keck-telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which still looks in the sky alongside them with the subaru-telescope and the IRTTF.
The Mauna Kea also aims to create a new, huge telescope - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be stunned on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from the All provide the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already provided pictures of remote worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been looking for extra solar planets - primarily for those inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates have been determined since the start of the mission.
In the picture the latest startup preparations are documented at the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot on board a Ariane5-rakete at the beginning of 2018.
The primary level of the space infrarotelescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It should look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Urknall.
Scientists assume that there is also at the southern pole of the Merkur ice.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the messengers are getting far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades indicated that there is ice on the Merkur.
By the Messenger Suns launched in 2004 - the first one that creates the Merkur - the scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter daily - and becoming 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblely high age.
There is even a museum for long-life.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparablely young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblely high age.
There is even a museum for long-life.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparablely young.
The journey through the Talysch mountain is called Wildromantisch.
The small bus runs across the arc-rich street, passing closely forested hills, ripping rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and soft, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here lives the Caucasian group of the Talys, which is not well-known, except that it is perfectly Persian and Azerbaijani and is very long-living.
The end station is Lerik.
The small town is proud with too arrogant architecture from Soviet times that does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the journey of Aserbaidshan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometres you need eight hours because the road is only one-pure.
The remarkable wealth that the country owing to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the thing to attraction to tourists.
"Baku was famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longlife, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented from about eight dozens of Talys from the area, which is over 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he became 120 years old.
A child born at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is the Shepherd of the Museum, which should have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person, who became 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had had 23 children, when he was 136 years old, he should have born another daughter.
So did Îirali Müslümov calculate a few decades at his age?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the high aged people in Central Asia.
"There are also many high aged people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Tal in Pakistan," explains Schotz, "and in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, because of the lack of documents, no scientific evidence of age should be provided, especially because of the lack of personal status registers.
Every day bech melted butter
However, the fact is that people of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100.
So why live here in the south so many old ages?
The Azerbaijanian travel leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva, however, believes that it is on diet.
But that the calorie-rich cost of the talys should be so healthy, the meat, bread, and especially milk products, and of which many drink a glass of butter every day, is not precisely plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With her 97 years, she is still comparablely young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butter fiber that she rolls up and down in a tireless way.
Eight people live here under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Two little children also jump around.
In the kitchen you can prepare the tea to the guests that are served in the typical, building-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in rice and leather, under her head cloth she hides long, dark-blonde pots, which proudly reveals her son before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and kept their color.
"Shampoo I never used," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is sufficient to live
She has always eaten only what came from her own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, herbs.
For my whole life, I haven't bought food for a single time in the supermarket.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in time after World War II.
But everything became better when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the Ruder.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven around the father's figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, has hardly known limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, later his son Ilham took over the Ruder.
Still, there is no need among the old Azerbaijans.
230 Manat (approximately the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions a amount of which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-greyed son is right: "The old ones enjoy high respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the large family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human law" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rivalizing announcements in Cairo reveal the depth of the country.
The future Constitution with the Sharia as a basis is violently contested.
The Egyptian President did not save with Pathos.
We have to create the transition.
"And that he succeeds, is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but most likely to address the Christian heads, the liberals, clarified Muslims and seculars.
Because they all, so far hopelessly distraught in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of graces of the mighty Muslim brotherhood.
He, so Mohammed Mursi almost apologized, temporarily circumcised the competences of the Constitutional Court and extended his competences to "save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who wears a doctoral title of the American University of South California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are about it, the world is not quite clear.
Do you want the Judiction to be dismissed?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been examined by the 100-headed Constitutional Constitutional Assembly, which is Islamically dominated, are partly enthusiasmful in a 15-hour parforceritt in the night.
As in previous constitutions, it is said in the draft that the jurisdiction is based on the principle of Islamic law.
But what's "Principia"?
This was and is an interpretation and it is to be feared that Islamists will use the swimming formulation and the thereafter legal gambling for a more strict interpretation of the sharia.
This indicates at least a new article: in all the matters relating to Sharia, the Al-Ashar University has to be advised, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiation power in the entire Sunnian Islam.
This does not have to, but it can mean that the clergy supervises the legislation, which in fact would result in the disarmament of the Judiction.
Many things in the draft authorization are interpretation
Also problematic: civil military justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served during Mubarak's reign to suppress opposition officers.
After the dictator's fall, up to 1,000 civilians were in military war.
The state should also, as it says in the draft, protect "the true being of the Egyptian family" and promote their morality and values.
This is so legally formulated that government institutions can even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
In the clear text, it means nothing but censur.
Moreover, no article expressly establishes the equality of men and women.
For that, another forbids to offend or blasphem the prophet Mohammed and his messengers.
But what is a reproach and how it is to be heeded remains unclean.
Similarly dubios mutates the formulation that the "infringement of people" is prohibited.
Is there already a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
Explanatory matter, as many things will be presented to the Egyptians for the referendum in the draft that Mursi has to sign and according to his words, "very soon".
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has been shaped against the power of Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual entrance on Friday evening on the Tahrir Square in Cairo and praised to bring the Charter to fall before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential elections.
Peace nobel prizes and ex-chauffer of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the draft Constitution belongs to "the Müllberg of History".
Through the short news service Twitter he visited the adherents Mursis to want to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and crash him," said Oppositional Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet soothed," the Egyptian media quoted Chaled Ali's opposition policy.
And several judges announced not to want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood remained on the other side to the counter-demonstration, but for caution not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer in front of the University of Cairo.
Many deceived women and followers of the Salafists participated in it and cried: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They called from Mursi, "Suver the land!" and said, "The Koran is our Constitution."
A struggle for the Highness of the symbolic Tahrir Square, on which everything took its beginning, would probably have swept up civil war-like conditions.
That was obviously not what Mursis followers wanted to risk.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters would have expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide on the electoral tour in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the design of Islamists is considered safe.
"The word of human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which had actually gone until February and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are individible for him.
He was beaten, sentenced, imprisoned for that.
"And now the word Human Rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are excessive breaches of democratic game rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President puts it out of force de facto," Saeda complains.
However, without civil society organisations, democracy could not work.
Saeda feels left alone, also by the international community, who considers the ideological direction struggle at the Nile with a mix of curiosity and excitement.
That could be revenge.
A demonstrant on the Tahrir warns, "You are giving a monster that you can't control anymore."
Rakfish from Norway: Is this the most badly smelling fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the country's secret of success have something to do with the local appetite of pretty badly smelling fish?
You take a selection of overwhelming cheese species.
They are placed in the middle of a bunch of dirty, wet sports clothing.
And leave her there a week.
Likewise, you need to imagine the nose-dehydrating smell of racing fish, one of the great delicatesses of Norway.
I'm located in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes - and this hard-nail smell in the air that just don't want to disappear.
Rakfish is sprayed with salt, which - depending on how tinting one would like his fish - is fermented in water up to one year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians are running to a festival here in Fagernes, which is now dedicated to this really very decorative speciality.
"You eat it raw and then spray it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire guard, but also organizes the festival as so-called "Rakfisk-General".
People eat small fish spices around us and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the racing fish," says Havard.
The spirituosis can push the smell.
I'll cost you a few puppies.
If you avoid bringing the racing fish near the nose, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a very long bus trip behind him.
Rakfish is the product of a very different, far poorer Norwegian era, as there were no cooling options yet and fish has been drunk in airproof salt water vessels in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after long fermentation, and – no doubt, he was consumed with alcoholic senses.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and moved mainly to the United States.
Today, the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive healthcare.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which had not been far more rich than Norway, immigrants flow.
Rakfish is regarded as something important - as an essential, although also strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He belongs to the more expensive courts you can buy here.
But actually here is everything expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norwegian does not often do it in the world press, and most people don't seem to disturb this.
Here it is still hated to call Anders Breivik by name - those racist legal extremists who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "event of July 22".
Norwegian is difficult to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
The main responsibility for today’s wealth of Norway has been the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our cellner, who distributes round tablets with mature racing fish, and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the staining blue eyes.
We are a - as you say - cautious people.
Your English is just like most people here.
We're not very pleasant, we don't like pride.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - a large part of the sectoral income is invested in a special fund for future generations.
In the years up to the world economy crisis, all of them were thrown around with money that they had not at all, Norwegian held his cash exchange firmly closed.
"As long as we can drive in winter ski and walk in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat racing fish," she adds with uncomfortable laughing.
I'm standing in the snow and standing for another court - I have enough from Rakfish.
It's like a elephant is something else, the soft meat.
But in the evening, the stink fish is back on the dinner plane.
The hotel in which I am staying is one of several events that organise a Rakfish dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - smell - fish.
There is a live TV screening to a fly-dressed show master, surrounded by plates with racing fish.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You're laughing and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict dust of all the fish.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto stands for difficult start
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his office, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges he faces and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is very bad.
Even in better days this is a constantly blocked city, but on Monday a ring of steel was built, which locks several important roads into the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
The aim was, however, not to disturb pendlers on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bond and take the lead of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the separating government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to prove well economically well, but the country is in the hands of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My government is committed to reducing violence," explained Pena Nieto early this week in the Oval Office to the U.S. president Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy to achieve this objective.
Before he went to an eye height with the U.S. president, Pena Nieto was the governor of his country of Mexico.
In this densely occupied, widespread part of the country surrounding the capital, the opinions of the new Head of State are divided.
A Direct Man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo you would like to remember him.
Inhabitants of the place of vacation acknowledge the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the motorways that made Pena Nieto build and represent a great improvement to the broke, holprive roads that were there once here.
Plastics with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and persistent changes from him," said his friend and political allies Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who is a Congress member of the Pena Nietos Party, who works PRI.
In particular, what security and economy concerns, we hope that an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress Abgeordnete Olvera admits that after 12 years, the party is presenting great expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos.
The objections of the opposition, which the new President lacks of substance, he rejects.
He is a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent stateman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and in many respects represents a pre-city of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of decisive urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was invoked to fight the drug bands operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly urgent problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large waste deposit alone in the last two years, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind.
During the term of office of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is devoted to their violence and murders of innocent women.
Critics Pena Nietos believe that he has at least not considered the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government has closed her eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the falling quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me photos of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her associate.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was hit, and the body stars had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana looks down on us. It is fitted next to a cross that wears one word: justice.
But exactly these, like the family, they have been rejected to her until now.
The authorities have treated me as a sweater, unrestster, nörglerin.
You want to simply accept their judgment and keep your mouth.
"But this is not possible if there were so many form errors and failures," she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bond on Saturday, he also takes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been suffered by violence in the past six years, and the new President has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope that as President he is as governor," says the PRI Congress Abgeordnete Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But just that, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are most afraid.
The State Attorney claims: Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The State Attorney contradicts the presumption of Bradley Mannings that he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with Mannings Time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
Defense seeks a rejection of the charges due to harsh arrest conditions
The liberation of the US Army is proposed to have dismissed thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the state prosecutor tried to find that the army-free Bradley Manning - accused for the biggest release of confidential information in the US history - failed several occasions to complain about his supposedly suffered mistreatment in military prison.
During a cross interrogation Mannings during a prejudice in Ft. Meade, Maryland, May. Ashden Fine explained that documents were not found to be made on weekly visits which prison officials had made during Mannings nine months of prison in Quantico, Virginia.
One day before the cruise hearing, which was held as a result of a defense request for the rejection of the charge - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard term of imprisonment - Manning had declared that he had considered suicide in prison.
The Secret Service Analyzer of the US Army, arrested in June 2010, is proposed to have stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service period in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as the source of information.
During the hearing on Friday, Fein with Manning went through the forms that officials had filled out in Quantico Military Prison after their meeting with Manning in Quantico, where he had been held under increased arrest conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When Fein consulted him on Friday on the forms, Manning admitted that he had assessed the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a "very professional" overall.
The forms, so fine, did not contain any complaints about mistreatment, although the officials had asked Manning directly for his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally, and the officials would have discussed them with him and indicated that they should deal with them, but they had not been logged.
"They wrote up "No problems" (after speaking of concerns) and that didn't necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," said Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he didn't complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicide thoughts mentioned by him several months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status to "prevention of injuries".
The military said that it has assigned him this restrictive status - which is one stage under the risk of suicide - to his and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was fine, and the observation status to prevent injuries (...) will be released to achieve a higher quality of life from my view," said Manning.
Manning said on Thursday to his arrest and relocation to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before being transferred to the prison of Quantico Marine Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said in Kuwait he considered suicide and had once become conscious because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or to the outside world had been burdensome.
"My world shrinked into camp Arafjon, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You only allowed him a mattress, a cover, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because in the day it was prohibited to sleep or just lie down.
He had to sleep with light, which entered into his cell from outside.
When he turned around at night and guards couldn't see his face anymore, he was raised so that he could turn back.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the Judge Manning also asked for a charge he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had a night naked to sleep in his cell in Quantico and had to be naked at a morning counting before guards and other prisoners.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his ceiling during this counting.
During the survey on Friday, Manning announced that he had closed from a command of his watch that he should have dropped the ceiling with which he could have covered. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he was forced to sleep naked in the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he was no danger for himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the covenant of his subpoes or his flip flops to hurt himself, but not doing so.
This night, Manning said, his subpoeses, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge should at least take into account his exercising experiences and significantly reduce his arrest, he should be condemned in his trial before the military court, which is appointed for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will confess a smaller crime for guilty, while other accusations that are considered to be too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing shall be postponed for this weekend.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been held in accordance with the provisions which apply to all prisoners held under the highest security arrangements in Quantico.
The accusations against Manning include the beneficiary of the enemy, the unlawful publication of secret service information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the steel of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all the charges, he is threatening a lifelong penalty.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people have been forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when inconsistency spread in me.
Schilder referred to two queues: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("extranjeros").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertain to whom I should be given.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexicans" for my whole life.
A ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston call "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italy".
Later, I decided for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for shortcuts or binding lines.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a mother speaker, and I won't leave my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the serpent for extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda, all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason why Mexicans remain in Mexico today with as high probability rather than emigrating to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block according to the example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even if he did not mention any details about this.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of interest.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that in 1848 the United States fell into Mexico and forced the leadership of the country under a gun to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not overlooked.
So once a U.S. government official also exercises the mildest criticism of Mexico, it is heard - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints about how the Americans impose the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezumas go to the war path.
Yet, Mexico's greatest challenge is true in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about recensions?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people live Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or a grandparent - had no chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases this person matched a profile - dark handy, unbilded, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness is true to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now live the American dream, visit good schools and have received good jobs, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes have disappeared, but what our loyalty concerns is not the case.
This is clearly true to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership team do not like us.
This is based on reciprocality.
They see us as a Mahnmal of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough to never be our bands to Mexico strong enough.
You think our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see ourselves trapped behind the silk curve - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and emigrated legally to the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this badly to them.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees itself as a part of two countries.
However, many Mexican Americans, I know, feel that they are neither of the country nor of the country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but none of them is rooted.
In Mexico we're seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of educational citizenship want to reconsider their connections to diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and press the political leadership to intensify their relations to Mexico.
Well.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unfair distribution of incomes, irregular corruption and drug abuse, many of us are not sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you have to go through alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a wrestling for how their family members have not been treated so long before.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more mexican than I thought.
Old battles, New Middle East
The stand of weapons between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be persistent peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bleeding events seem to have such a hope to stumble in the groom.
In the midst of the usual debt allocations, countless buildings were placed in Schutt and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time missiles from Gaza were hit near the Israeli Metropole Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israeli and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historical conflict, the Middle East changes around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these disguises.
Perhaps this will only lead to more blood pouring.
But there are reasons for assuming that the deadly Patt situation could finally end.
A war that is not lost or won
At the first glance, optimism seems to be everything other than appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the arms resisted on November 21, the fights this week strengthened the hearts on both sides.
The leaders of the Hamas, the Islamic movement, which has been controlling the Gaza strips since 2007, are claimed to have pushed the Israelis back, although his group had to suffer great losses itself.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are occupied in one of the most desolate and closely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy Hamas until now.
In fact, the Hamas gains in the West Territories, which is controlled by the rivalizing, decent Palestinian group of Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to their side.
Turkey, a reassuring regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim allies, has taken on the Hamas Party, just as Katar, one of the richest and dynamic golf states.
Jubilee Hamas followers believe that around Israel there is a Islamic half moon - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has power, over Syria, where rebels of an increasing Islamist impression could stand before the decay of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas's allies threaten the king.
And especially the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most inhabitant and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region sustainably.
Hosni Mubarak, the Lazarist despot, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had only a few time left for the Hamas.
On the other hand, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be excluded by Israel and the United States.
On the other hand, the Israeli Hardlins have to draw a opposite conclusion.
Militaryly, the Hamas is no more danger.
The Israeli Rakete Protection System, "Iron Dome", has been able to prove, and many of the Hamas Raketes have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States holds their position inevitably, and many European countries have been responsible for the latest scaling of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially among Prime Minister Binyamine Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process at large.
Although Raketes from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide attackers - not least thanks to the blocks that are entering into the West Territories and thus to the main part of a possible Palestinian state, which protects the Jewish settlements, which have been declared unfair to international law, but are increasing.
Netanyahu stands well. His Likud party joined Avigdor Lieberman with an even more fighter group in the front of the elections on 22 January.
Why do these misleading Palestinians also shame and leave their own state?
If they actually had control over the Westjordan country, wouldn't they, just like their contestants in the Gaza Strip, also fire missiles?
No, it's better to keep them in chess behind the wall and punish them, they should dare to lift their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to cope, but the Arab spring could make them a strike through the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The Defense Set of Israel is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
That the pragmatic President Mursi joins Barack Obama in order to achieve a weapons resistance could be a promised sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israeli should also think more long-termly.
While the rest of the Arab world takes sightful steps towards democracy, Palestinians continue to be robbed their self-determination rights - a powder fibre that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied areas, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only grow.
Bloody missions to reduce Hamas in the Gaza Strip will be increasingly demanding their diplomatic triumph over the years.
Both sides need an external attack
The right answer is those represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel departs for security purposes.
The little hope for the near future is that the arms silence of outsiders will give greater influence to the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Katar, must now stop the weapons supply in the Gaza stripes and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by regional exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Very far away in the white house it seems as if he would like to be a necessity to participate.
But this is a sad, short-looking perspective.
The United States has a major interest in a stable Middle East.
And this includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian legislation for uniform cigarette packaging enters into force
Health warnings and sick body parts on neutral green packs similar to all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging have entered into force in Australia. This replaces brand logs and colours with neutral olive green covers, printed with drastic images, which show sick body parts and cigarette smoke infants and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and images, the only difference between the packings in the brand names printed in identical, smaller writings is from the coming Saturday.
This introduces Australia's strictest arrangements for tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from smoking by removing the glamourous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not yet started with 26 will no longer begin smoking with 99% probability afterwards.
"You can already see in children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to apply with their brand image," says Bundesgesundheitsminister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia is one of the smallest in the world and the changes will have little effect on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby struggled hard against the laws.
So it said that the laws would promote black market trade, which leads to cheaper and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian fakers will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have accelerated their business.
Sandra Ha by Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarette and silicone covers has increased enormously since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan had failed to cover the main Australian court with their objection to the laws.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and waited for new stocks.
It's a good business for us.
According to experts, the hack is in the popularity of social media with exactly the population group to which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising to prohibit them from standing as sports sponsors and forced most traders to stop interpreting cigarettes in shops. Now the tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international pages.
"Who markets tobacco and has only a small area left to apply for its products is not around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on brands written by "ganz normal people".
You have to ask yourself: Is this just a private person who finds such a great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that it even records a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do so?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry focuses on marketing instead of dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries are dealing with Australia with greater trade.
A WTO decision is expected for mid 2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted discussions with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country that prescribed photographic warnings in 2001.
They have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Heavy laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are detestable.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'll just ignore them.
"You just take a cup and hide the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette bag on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in Sydney's Interior, says that the single packaging has made it difficult to fill his regimes.
"I used an hour earlier to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should simply have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have told ourselves all right, that's what we're closing," he obviously adds intimately.
In a constantly elected world, it is nice to be even bored
I spent this thanksgiving unexpected five hours at the airport when our plane fell out due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flyer.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts boring.
I don't want to lie.
A half day waiting for a flight at the airport is quite nervous - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But increasingly more academics and child development experts lead to slowness as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's for us - and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored.
This forces the brain to lose in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us today almost constantly stare on one screen or another, the advantages of slowness will no longer benefit us.
So should we welcome the slowness with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll come back to that again.
As many people, I have always assumed that slowness is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that.
"In fact, the slowness has a very long story," he says.
The house walls Pompejis describes a Latin graphfiti over slowness, which goes back to the first century.
And then there's the question how we actually define boredness.
John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, said that the problem is that slowness has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that slowness can be defined as the experience of "to have a satisfactory activity but not to be able to do so".
Tougherly, apathy is different because the person is not busy, but wants to be.
On the other hand, there is no need to do something.
The key experience of slowness, he says, exists in a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with bad sound and the feeling that the time is just slowly passes".
Toughness can be almost as much as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions could be related, depressive people see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we have just difficulty focusing.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German, for example, "The inactive mind: The definition of Langeweile under the aspect of attention" published in the Special Journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment with the participant listening to a band on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others listened to low volumes, so it was hardly perceived, while the third group did not see this noise at all.
The people who experienced the hardly hearable television indicated to feel more bored than the two other groups - they had problems to concentrate, could not find any reason for them and admitted their difficulties of boring.
When you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boredness, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you exercise a lonely activity - "such as searching for defective products on a factory support band, music can distract and help to feel uncomfortable".
In fact, he says, we now know that herbs and crickets, often interpreted as signs of boring, can even fight them by keeping people physically more attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to hike around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit down," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some time - my late flight, a droneing speaker, a particularly tired movie.
But some people bore more than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "scale for slowness" in the 1980s.
On the scale, statements like "Many things I have to do are repeating and being monotone" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
With such scales, researchers have found that boys become more often bored than girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, Professor for Psychology at the University of Westflorida - especially as regards the need for more and a greater variety of external rice.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty relaxed crowd.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and her parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of the adults were bored in school and in the work of the house, while 23% indicated that they were bored if they weren't in school.
But only 3% of the parents admitted to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know if the percentages have risen or decreased with regard to slowness.
However, he is sure that "youth will feel particularly bored," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a great influence on their everyday course.
So back to my question of origin: Is slowness healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and falling down to gambling or drugs to relieve them - that has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between slowness and creativity. This is Professor Vodanovich who has researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With the slowness, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do the best.
When a man is boring and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you will be happy.
Yet, television can provide for happiness in the short term, but they are reversed for the long term.
Thus, if you are enough to have an iPad, you can get it away from the boring, but it has not learned to entertain or control yourself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self control is transferred from one situation to the other."
The child learns not only to entertain but also to gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boring.
Nor should we see them too critical.
Instead, our goal should be to make us feel well, apart from the continual development of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be more bored than often, but boring is the painful, unreasonable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that in truth people are only looking for a way, turning off and relaxing.
"In a environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is once lost."
There is no clear guide for the new marijuana law in Colorado
The 19-year-old Community College student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the Southeast Colorados for a crime before court that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some few less marijuana brokes and a pepper with which he smoked it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found Marihuana in the car, Orozco was invited for the possession of drugs and drug utilities - cavaliers delicts each with a penalty of 100 US dollars - and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks after the State's decision to legalize small quantities of marihuana for self-use, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller drug defects less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of legal infringements that are about marijuana are already left down here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer persecute adults over 21 years for small ownership, which is legally allowed as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next weeks.
But state lawyers in the more conservative districts of Colorados have announced to persecute existing marijuana-likes and still quote people before court.
At the same time, several cities, from the premises of Denvers to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, stately licensed marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I don't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, Head of Police in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And also regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are thoroughly scratching.
They are waiting for an orientation aid to establish a license system for production, production, sale and sale of drugs - and have a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is predominantly predominant in most countries as regards the regulation of Marihuana, where the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consuming.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore suitable for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman of the Supervisory Authority for Spirituosen in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We do not have a real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington Law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus also forms the end point of a Grauzone in which the state license system does not exist yet but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practice issues need to be clarified during this time - such as how the state standard of "adjusted access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the ban on cannabis operations around 300 metres around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
"Everywhere it will be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the balling area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, speaker for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently educated research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent his employees in Aurora an e-mail in which he declared that the state lawyer would no longer pursue smaller marijuana-likes in persons over 21 years, and that the police would not seek "from immediately" criminal admissions for these crimes.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to implement urban standards for the regulation of farmers of medical marijuana and continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorados, District State Attorney Ken Buck represents a more stringent view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of Marihuana possession, mainly in order to move consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 persons must be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less Marihuana before court, although many have been accused of other delicates.
"Our authority has the obligation to persecute infringements in which it was the time of crime," said Buck in a statement.
The reactions, even in places such as the Mesa County, where voters refused the Marihuana initiative, are twinty.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District State Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to let all outstanding property procedures fall.
"I don't think I'm spending my time using the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the start that it would not be easy to agree the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a deep divergence among local officials in terms of the great green experiment of days.
In the case of District State Prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, who represents prosecutors in the court of Marihuanadelicts, and acts on the spot as a speaker for the national organisation to reform Marihuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their life in persecuting people in criminal law that they can still not accept legalisation," he believes.
As first countries treating smaller quantities of marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national model cases for legalisation of drugs.
While speakers and government officials prepare for a age of legal sales, they also wait nervously for instructions from the Federal Government to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of Marihuana at federal level as a crime.
President of the Legalisation movement hopes that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several exciting arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the Federal Government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisers of the Obama Government, believes that although criminal officials are likely not to enter doors to consume smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to be struggling to tolerate legal, stately regulated Marihuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local municipal administrations approved Moratories for new Marihuana businesses, although they could only open in about one year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided a six-month ban that is probably adopted next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then stand before a big problem at federal level," says Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this change of law.
We are judged by what the municipality has decided and not by what the state has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was pushed out of Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my elder brother had attended that university, which I once believed is the world’s greatest knowledge stamp, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry to Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had decided to study history - I had packed my bag and thus brought my first scandal of my life.
My father broke into tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it said I would have gone because I had a problem with the fact that comilitones had sex in the neighboring room.
The author A N Wilson explained that I had left the university because I had been forced to drink from damaged bags.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yeah, ran, because I suffered from systematic mobing and threats.
Not about because of my quite unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had only been scrambled for one reason - a reason that was an important consultant, Margaret Thatchers, and I advocate the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of appropriate rights suffers from similar persecution.
The organized and increasing hatred on Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same protection of equal rights, which benefits from swelling, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College indicate that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and unwanted because of their political views".
They require a place in the Equal Rights Committee of their College to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was worsened by a recent documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented tories as excentricists and Neonazis.
It showed, among other things, a graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Studental Association of the University of Oxford, who was driving in a Rolls-Royce and prospered with silver-coloured suit and silver occupied cotton.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered to be "sinbows for the introduction of higher studies fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Students Association of the University of Nottingham, wrote in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left trend at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without having ever met us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christ, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated President of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, says that she has observed a growing refusal to students of appropriate rights in JCR members.
"This poses a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the welfare of the members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredible 18-year-old I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred on the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the University had voted for not to give an honoral title to Margaret Thatcher - an earlier student - due to reductions in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have made Stalinists scream.
In the first days of the first semester week, where new students and the tutors meet, I received a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors did not only tolerate the ridicule of tory students, but even with joy.
Political topics such as the mining worker strike, privatisation and rejection of the government of sanctions against South Africa's Apartity regime found their way to the wooden-made rooms of the Tutorium.
At my first events, I had to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been taken to what would then come.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (meansomely died), "translate the first paragraph."
I stole.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a cake deig, and quite awesome.
"Does Thatcher-Anhangers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students cooked.
In my eyes, tears were walled up.
"I suggest that they take some French hours in your leisure time - so if you are not too busy with your social activities," Pitt crawled me.
I returned to my room with hanging head.
That evening, I was sitting in college alone at dinner when someone took me easily on my shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he friendlyly said.
Unfortunately, it's the way it is.
Everyone who is suspected of being Tory is forced to be.
It's already bad enough for me, but they know your father Margaret Thatcher's near, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most of the Tory first semesters suggest that they be attendants of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to act.
I was saying that I wasn't in any respect with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove impossible.
A study beginner in the field of philosophy, politics and economy, who ironically visited the Eton College, said to me, "You are the daughter of a Fascist girl".
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and foolish.
"How did Tories have sex?" asked one.
They hit each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet the same ones after the inbreak of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years in front of me, in front of my spiritual eye, became a fever of rage and isolation.
The only tutor who was openly recognised as Tory was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative but also because he had advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy and written for them.
He was just rare.
He hated the place, found him provincially and small-kared and rejected him for his marxist-determinist history perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to pend between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge in more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelievable.
During his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said smallly.
They would never do something like that, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends were always putting in the day an inappropriate manner.
His moist eyes fell down.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure you're just necked.
It would break my heart if you left.
It was exhausted by my frequent trips to London that my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also tory attendants, had abandoned the pressure and dismissed his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, where another historian had seriously claimed that I was "a enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was in secret shamelessly, I admitted that my parents had undergone a "brainwashing" and called them "old tricks".
The relief took a short time.
It was my father who hit the last nail in my Oxford carriage.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, my horsemen gave up.
When they went, I packed a bag and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Well, you can call me a wedding fool.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and maliciousness in a educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that produced not only 14 Prime Ministers of Tory, but hiding behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of celebration"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture" opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian Modemacher.
Somerset House, former residency of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital that is worth the accommodation of an exhibition over Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognised by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Couture were composed, created by his "Maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but without his distincted clients could not have been written.
Valentino always felt fascination for the sticky and remote world of the adel.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most read aristocracy, starting from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, over the Princess Marie Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as the trophes of his social ascension from the modem actor in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetsets.
Being in love with the adel does not have to be disadvantaged.
"At least, they don't put their chickens on your magnificent carpet, as it does some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all were happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friendly with forgotten beautys such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always prefered the elegance of celebration.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the Charisma of the Modemacher.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went home to dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music recognized and felt his influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," recalls the "Top model", which started their career at the week of the Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his designs are artworks," she concludes.
Mother View of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a history of insaneness, rather of mutual loves.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 metres long walking step that suggests a roll exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the walk to admire a dreamy "audienz" that wears the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti drew in "La Notte" or a mantle of wool and leather belonging to Kaiserin Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion puppens, names like the names of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxi, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemacher, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a hook, a shirt, a western guy "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/Winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the Muses of the Designer.
"I draw him to all others because of his great love for the women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-herzogin of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and princesses at Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came to this effect.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a festival in my father's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a draped upper part with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its occupyment is timeless," explains this Italian aristocracy, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening clothes of the Modemacher "with absolute care" "because a dress is not only a dress but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of the Mode
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for their wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the Modemacher called its nearby runs) were necessary to make this ivory colored silk dress with pearls, twelve different sticks and a four and a half meter long sweep.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the expert press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the Elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, excellent with the honoral legion, Garavani cumulates as many honors as each of his wives.
"I always noticed his refinement, his peace, his cared and perfect outerness," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala evening at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Counter Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was ugly; the time does not leave any traces to him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, stoned paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work in word in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who deserve their lives by getting sulphur from the Vulcan Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To this end, he must rise down to the ground of his crater every day, where the gas that flows from the earth is mounted in contact with the air.
After he broke out large sulphur stones that can weigh up to 70 kilos, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the distant paths of stone.
Although there are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, rising up to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle speed, keeping the balance and taking care of their steps so that they do not swallow and crash.
They know that every step can cost her life, as happened by a French tourist who crashed on the steak hangs of the Cawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocent for each kilo sulphur they degrade.
Upstairs, they run the way between the tourists that they photograph as circus monkeys and run with the tired heavy baskets three kilometres up to the wave, which a mine company has set a little further down on a height of 1850 metres
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who since 1960 uses the events in the Vulcan and (not better said) its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupias (5 Eurocent) for each kilo sulphur.
It then sells 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry because this mineral is widely distributed in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of straw wood, fireworks articles, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar.
"As we usually wear 70 kg, we receive about 46,000 rupias (3,8 euros) for every way," explains Anto, who normally takes three routes a day.
For each route, he takes three hours of complete achievement, but at the end of the day, he will have 138,000 rupias (11,5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such a rather inhuman effort, but the threefold of what he would deserve with field work.
"The miners' daily lonel here, where 15 000 rupias are paid at the crop (1.2 euro) on the day and the average monthly income is two million rupias (167 euro) is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a Maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he deserved 75,000 rupias (6,2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and this for a reason that is so important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hinduists, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathed with difficulty, hauls frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been putting his life on the Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left the first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathed with difficulty, hauls frequently and his eyes are irritated from the volcano because of the toxic gases.
This is the price he must pay for reaching his dream.
"I will work here two years more because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent, but punished by life could work as a tourist leader, cellner or at receiving a hotel, but instead he performs the work of a tragedy.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other bearings and rises up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluely in the darkness.
The shadows challenging, he rises to the crater in the light of a small stomach lamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers at the crater floor charge the basket with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanized the sulphur reduction to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They do not receive any share of the 30,000 rupias (2.5 euro) award per photo device, which the guards of this natural park, together with the entry money of 15,000 rupias (1.2 euro) demand from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human bearing.
"This work is for the animals and not for humans" protests Madrusin, a steam, 42-year-old carrier who has worked three decades since the school left at Kawah Ijen.
He is able to wear up to 110 kg and assured that he continues, "as long as it goes," because he needs the money for raising his three children between 10 and 18 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes climb when the wind suddenly turns and the miners stick into the thick pillars that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that nobody complains about severe illnesses ... of course, except the usual breath problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and blows on the shoulders that have distorted from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on his back, Unainik with his 53 years is only able to wear 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, which are transported from three trucks through a goat path between the bowl to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
"I will not go to pension, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life," explains Unainik, opening his mouth far away, in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder works with his 30 years as a sulphur tractor.
The time passes, but the poorness continues generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: the one who works as a human burden on the Cawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans are pushing the fault that they have no children, on the career, stress and the cost of real estate and children's education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: We're fulfilling our citizenship and we're creating life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for minzbons, but yet - or just because of it - they became at the beginning of this year in Singapore into a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local proverbs, such as "Shifting will be a "bao" (Laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who rotated the video, observes the hope that the advertising spot is a fun way to make attention to the problem.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is something just for the Internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
It is the largest problem in this country.
In continuing, we are the worst of the world, so we realized that it is a topic that we had to care about.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the sale of parfums with pheromons or the organisation of speed data evenings (fast flirts).
Possibly that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not imperatively lead to success.
So we thought: Why not do something as creative as possible to address this problem, such as compose a rap?
1.2 Children
Whoever does not take this topic easy is the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends 1,300 US dollars for policy measures to encourage citizens to get more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends the maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich high-tech city state in the southeast of Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to his national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as a replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporens get kids anymore?
Tan Wei Ming, head of marriage and family policy of the national public authorities, says that this is due to "better training" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has made it possible for people to marry without marriage and to form a family to have much more options in relation to life goals and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of singles and to the delay of marriage and births, whose result is the reduction in birth rates in Singapore.
At the same time, a immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the reduction of the population resulted in return in local populations.
In Singapore there are websites where the hardly chessed Xenophobia bleeds against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized to keep the wages low and do not integrate themselves.
The increase in immigration is also considered to be one of the reasons why the government party in Singapore last year achieved its worst electoral outcome since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate shows the well-known effects on the economic growth of a nation with tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square metres and show a great sales result.
However, there is anxiety that they can promote the lifestyle of the single one and that they fear the construction companies from building a large house for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are selling out faster for days and even weeks than the larger living units.
This results in that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer directions that were previously hindered if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could provide the way for an increase in national birth rates, the discussions with the Singaporeans who work in the financial district are not going to have a major effect.
"The people are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me it is important to have my own money and time," another, about twenty-year-old man says.
Men and women lead their career, stress and the cost of ownership and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why the Singaporens have the last word when it comes to getting children - there the government can do so much.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private life or "in any area of private life where you are entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16 years?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he makes known on the Internet situations that he wouldn't share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five teenagers aged 10 to 15 who are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very own" at personal level and "to the password and user" when they applied it to social networks.
"I wouldn't announce my deepest secrets in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge when trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share any photo that's not mine, or someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to write obscene photos, of naked, of crime, or insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures you to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine successors in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I logged in at Twitter to express myself and to write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if anybody answers me, I just charge them up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or to friends," he admits.
He asked that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown.
Even if someone recommends a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits that 20 of the people he has added to his friends list.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, for example music," he admits.
According to the boy, nobody made any suggestions or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone insists on me or demands her from me, I simply remove him from my user account," he admits.
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unknown experiences known as cyberbullying today.
The acquaintance of a friend was pressed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never learned who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
"He just made it private."
Then he explains a series of steps to configure a user account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he was insympathic to me or I would like to wipe him out.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher for English with graduation in education and learning, believes that to address children and adolescents, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information, but with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academicist Marc Prensky, owner of a master title in pedagogics at the University of Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and youths who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are to teach them where we still learn ourselves," he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "because we demand that they have a defined criterion on what may be spread, published or said, and this in an age where maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be selective when it is the most important for them to be popular to have thousands of friends without reflecting on the consequences," he adds.
According to the professional, the most effective way to teach children and youths is to ask them questions that bring them to think.
"You don't say they shouldn't do it, don't work," he says.
Porras then calls some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why then do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like to publish a photo of you like that you have published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question: Should everyone know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to understand them that they need to act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"Anyone outside the Internet is dealing with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you may share or publish" he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers".
Final of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the declaration of Lima, which was announced in advance and should be signed theoretically by the seven present governments.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI. General meeting of the state and government leaders of the Unasur. Sources in the State and President's Chair at the beginning announced that they would pass it after the clause, however, explained that it would be published at some time on the website of the Peruvian Government.
In the case of questions on the text, they indicated that the content was presented to the press by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day in the press room, only the picture of the presidential meeting was transferred with the "Private Session, Limited Audio" message.
The few information that circulated among the journalists was received by the press speakers of some of the unasurian governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruan press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused unpleasantness in the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media, which demanded more information.
Afterwards, the President-in-Office of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the Declaration of Humala and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru was host of the IIIth Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even at this opportunity, despite a strong call by the press, the so-called statement of Lima, which had been announced before, was not published as much.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be convinced that the document was published in the last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities emphasized that the information systems would be available for journalists, but they restricted access to information to a large extent.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of the Hague, which contributes to a border conflict between two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would adopt the decision of the IGH, which begins in the Hague on Monday, in the process of initiating Lima against Santiago to listen to the Plädoyers both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences that we are presently presenting to this international court," said Humala together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that follows international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, concludes agreements and undertakes international courts," Piñera adds and greeted Humala with a hand pressure in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the IGH was made after Columbia, after a decision on the Maritime Borders with Nicaragua, which considered it a serious mistake, had raised a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after his president Fernando Lugo was resigned, did not participate in the meeting.
The guest president Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and ended the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The Head of State left the final document in which it announced that 16 decisions were taken and the action lines for 31 projects between the South American countries were set over a total investment amount of $17 billion.
He said to the decisions taken that the countries of Unasur will "take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the decisions on residence rights."
He announced that measures would promote "to improve cooperation in the fight against uncertainty in cities and against the organised cross-country crimes, as well as measures to improve access to drugs and the Internet at low prices in all South America areas and to act together and efficiently in the case of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not accept triumphing trains, but should serve to expand our production performance and to show our peoples a better future", added Humala.
"We have decided to give a number of 31 symbolic projects the priority to improve the spatial relations in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and create new economic forms," said the Peruan President in a reading declaration.
Among these projects would also be five Peruans located on the cross-sections of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should ensure a better connection with Ecuador, although he did not provide any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country serves for its resumption in the Union of South American nations", of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourhood relations was another aspect that was stressed at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before his participation in the regional meeting in Mexico, he expected a meeting with his fellowman Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict respectably after a judgment of the IGH, which was challenged by Bogotá.
"Please I'll meet President Daniel Ortega on Saturday morning," said Santos.
"We will review all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also requires discussions with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope that I can tell President Ortega that we will be treated as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the Block also met in advance for the adoption of the 2013 Action Plan in which the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region should be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even though the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America needs to learn in the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the sixth Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, explained to the state television in Peru that the Europeans were "deceased in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and "today are practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that promotes the Member States of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is the case already in the Andes community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also welcomed the reconstruction of the American State Organisation (OEA) under the requirement to reduce the influence of the Angelsaxic States and to take into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach do not commit themselves to anything, and in turn we always sign the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission has its seat in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as an indication of the political asylum which Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but had fulfilled his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that then there were "founded suspicions that Assange would deliver to a third country and would not comply with his procedure."
He also criticized the Swedish justice that he demanded of him to undertake in his state area for an alleged sexual delict, while "the Swedish law allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out through the message of Ecuador in London."
Correa explained that the risk was that the health and mental condition of assange would be affected.
"Since he has been in our message, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a light problem with the lungs, but no serious," said the Head of State of Ecuador.
However, there is a danger that he may have physical and psychological damage because he is caught in a narrow space and cannot carry out physical exercises outside.
"This would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution for the asylum, which has been granted assange since the month of June in the message of Ecuador in London, was the granting of a free letter with which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that there had been discussions with London to find a solution for the trapped founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures on various European bodies," he explained.
And "If Britain gives this letter tomorrow, I think this is done."
And if Sweden consulted Mr Assange on the message of Ecuador in London or on Skype, how it permits the Swedish law and in other cases, the problem was solved.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he doesn't tolerate is "the mediumness, the evil intent and the lie that dismisses the free expression of opinion."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the wicked and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and pressure," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "and not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and spider-bourgeois countries" and precluded that in a re-election, he would "depth the revolution to continue the way to this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, while he argued that the organism must remain "hard and should not take place any opportunism and no legally dressed state strike" because it "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of the Hague, which preferred Nicaragua's Maritime State Authority to negotiate the maritime borders between two countries with Nicaragua, for "absolutely".
This judgment is currently not implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Mediterranean state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated comprehensively so that you can overcome them and look forward.
Similarly, he trusted in a good conclusion of disputes about the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to call on international bodies if both countries commit themselves to accept the judgment even if it falls very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he will be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to achieve his third mandate, he said that he "sees this opportunity with much optimism and joy, although it sometimes falls very difficult."
Correa assured that if he rejected the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from the political life.
Power has never personally interested me, but under the unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was me that guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as President, afterwards I withdraw from public life.
This is true if we lose.
"This is decisive," he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had travelled there for a planned routine treatment, and that he would expect to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any case mean a fall in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecudorian Head of State today took part in Lima on the Sixth Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was completed with the call for a higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death for AIDS is today an too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the results of the investigation: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "save" without any apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform himself about it, and this with such effort that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, the director of an IMSS clinic avoided adopting "because it led to a sackgasse."
At that time, AIDS was synonymous for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic, who don't know anything about their disease and who have already caused damage to the virus and have exhausted their immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is taking the treatment in time and that the survival of the general population is exactly the same", explained the head of the HCG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, who said that this information was based on a viewed scientific publication in April of this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists have concluded since 2008 that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life deviate from the degree of infringement of the immune system of persons at the beginning of treatment, and that those greater opportunities that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years in the counting of 200 CD4 and 50 years in the counting of 500 CD4.
Simplely, the above statements mean that whoever receives HIV-positive diagnosis at the age of 25 in this sense "can become troubleless 75 years of age as long as he is under control," explained this professional.
In order to correctly manage this progress, it must be reminded that the life expectancy of the Mexicans is an average of 76 years today.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (OnusIDA’s Annual Report), it is true that 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone 255 people died in 2011, and until May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why are people still dying?
- I think the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least over the past 12 years, we had no supply problems with the medicines. The problem is that people come in a far advanced state because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnostics are required, so all those in whom this is necessary need to offer massive detection tests."
This proposal is in agreement with the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also with the patients like Fabrizio who had carried out his test at a private laboratory, and this is for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, had already been in the AIDS phase and had even the Kaposi sarcome (a cancerlike tumour), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I already have to die, I'd rather plate three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, drive sports and take the medicines.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I'm living a normal life, just like everyone else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, to animate with his witness those who are today fearing in the context of the world's AIDS day.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsible like all people.
His news is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the store table
There are large holes between the health programmes and the simple citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the matter of HIV.
And the most important thing is the prevention.
In the particular places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; earlier they were given individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
Youths are among the risk persons for new infections.
"Why do you need that?" is a widespread question of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system that youths do not want to take place, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorientation of this inefficient distribution; condoms should be not only behind the store table but in public toilets in public equipment that are frequently visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiskuity.
It should not be paid to them the beer and motel, as the governor Emilio González answered to the question whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like it; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already exercising sexual activity," he put it on the point.
Key data by Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is nationally located on 4th place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and at 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of the infectious cases occur via sex, 6% over the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people who do not know for each registered case.
After the United States appeal court has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructure of the liabilities of the Vitro group achieved through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, an unhealthy precedent is created for each national company with establishments in the neighbouring country which have problems with payments.
It could therefore be said that in the country of stars and stripes, the procedures for survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in conflict with international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas resulted in the unnecessary exposure of the Mexican companies to their ownership beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call on the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistencies.
While the Judge indicates that the creditors must be subject to the United States' bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit appeal court, established in New Orleans, initially says that the main procedure is the commercial bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for incapacity of companies with cross-country profiles is not known.
In fact, the United Nations model law for the unification of international trade law was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute used as a simpler.
Secondly, the judgment determines that without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass which the branches of Vitro had with their parent company, the necessary majority would not have been achieved for the restructuring of liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There are a half dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed among companies of the Group by the Institute of Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundes Institute for Commercial Conkurses).
It is also true that, after the votes of the branches were withdrawn, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who accused against Vitro at the United States courts, i.e. the Geier funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there is Vitro guilty for his difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which granted the country Slag.
For this reason, the González Sada family objects to the same appeal court so that the vote will take place in the plenary, i.e. from all judges, because only three voted.
If it does not take place, the Cerciorare objection, which calls for the examination of the procedure by a higher body, in this case by the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The gravity of this case is that the court left a document by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the Court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Law on Commercial Conkurss, and pointed out that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Conkurs Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission for international trade, i.e. the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border inability to pay, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band caramels: a hit for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the announcements by the Mexican air traffic trade unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of a fraudulent administration, did not come forward several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Sociación of the Pilotos Aviadores) finally made progress.
The request referred to by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now submitted a criminal proceedings against the National Bank and Securities Commission, which is proposing the disability of justice.
After that, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the Republic's main administration of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw from the Bank IXE's account F/589 to the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million Pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administratora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a Forum of the University of Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental protectors, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a wide front to resist the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of the processing industry) has reached to unite the governors in the south-eastern to resist the monumental institution that was partly destroyed and represented the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a request of the Senate to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassadors in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known under the English abbreviation ACTA, has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Own property.
As you know, these measures were taken, although the Senate had failed to consider the possibility because he viewed them as an infringement of the free expression in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In striving to pay long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the building company Homex brings stock certificates of more than 500 million pesos on the market.
The emission is the first of four equal emissions that promise a interest payment every 28 days.
Foundation of Competival
NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies of information technology, founded a company group under the name Competival, whose goal is the service market of software clubs in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are over $1.5 billion.
Héctor "hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bomber of the basketball, Héctor "hetin" Reyes, was connected to the basket sport for more than 60 years and has traveled all over the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have a large spiritual collection of the country's basketball history like Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound to the wheelchair in 2008, Rexes was a part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, players of the first national League, officers and leaders in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"For a life of my life, I have been a lot of shelter in the basketball, even several at the same time when I was president of the BSN, head of the National Team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered when he visited Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lived with Isabel, his married wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes isn't exaggerating this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and testify them.
Bayamón in the Heart
The most emotional memories are those who remember at his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s as players until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year-old anniversary as co-business manager or manager of the club.
"That were my best years I enjoyed most because I had been allowed to be part of the eight masterships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as a manager, co-worker or trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five masterships of each other from 1971 to 1975.
And then I adopted with a mastership in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very powerful and 2 m large player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico ever had.
Afterwards, Bartow recommended the freewurf specialist Raymond Gausse, who became one of our best warrants.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a mastership for Bayamon, Gausse would be able to make another one.
The mastership of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted him, but already from a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then the World Championship came in 1990, where we placed the fourth place where Bronze should have been, if not this Canadian arbitrator, who made us repeat the last move for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the World Championship in 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
It belongs to the best, as well as those who won against the Dream Team at the Olympiade in 2004.
My favorite, however, is the team of the pan-American games in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and offered a fight to the U.S. team, as when they won against us at the World Championship Bronze.
With that team, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be involved in a knee injuries in 1990.
A team that may not be the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and who made us great joy, was those of the pre-olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the locked players because of the events on the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won the Gold Medaille against every forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculín.
And this without taking into account his career in the different bodies in which he has played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the band?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams during a season.
What else do you do?
There are things I had introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and meet only in the national Playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children do unnecessarily many trips and games.
At least I see the result of the required training and courses for trainers, table-officers and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R. in the television series "Dallas", where he played a creepless, foolish and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnet J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of the 80's greed, is dead.
He became 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new staircase of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear birth town of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he liked most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the festivals of the harvest.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in the hospital of Dallas, she said Jeffrey Lane.
He made all those who knew him joy.
He was creative, generous, funny, lovely, and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived in full trains," explained Gray in a message.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 with hepatic cirrhosis, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over years.
In 1995 a malicious tumour was detected in his liver, and he undergone transplantation.
During the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known as a nice guy in the television in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the NBC TV.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on the head when he meets a attractive "dinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also performer of two comodies, which were only shortly exhibited, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his cinema work, the roles of criticism were well-evaluated in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the magnificent awesome J.R. who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain over the Ewing-Clan and other figures in their surroundings was released from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who shot on J.R." to create the expectation of a episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were betted in race houses.
So the series reached an audience record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who converted "Dallas" to the second most seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin, the widow of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had weakened her and threatened to present her as prostitutes if she didn't leave the city, but others had reason to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a retained businessman and unfaithful husband who strived to indicate his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on J.R.'s grave stone," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here is the Honorable Citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, composer of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "nurious personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and unrepentant for millions of worshipers in the world and remains in our hearts those who had the happiness of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were presented a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second staircase was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, informed the sender.
From Warner or TNT there was no immediate explanation of how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actor and singer Mary Martin, who played classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a youth when she got Larry with lawyer Ben Hagman during her marriage.
He tried his luck on the theatres in New York early in the 1950s, after then served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything I believed that it could hurt someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the hepatic transplant, he worked for hepatic donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxiety patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations are ahead and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but it's gonna be good for you".
Similarly, he rejected smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of courses studying the "End of the World"
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and chemistry and global warming.
Every semester when the religious professor decided to keep a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an inconsistent fishing hook: the end of the "long backward counting" of the Maya calendar on December 21, which many people believed that it meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what he should expect in the following two months: the destructive orrikan Sandy, some called "Deudarmaggedon", and a growing conflict with Israel's participation, the place of which Christian theoretics believe that the Apokalypses begin.
"I haven't noticed that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that ever existed," Charmé said this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad thing is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers this semester, which should actually be the last in history, courses about the "End of the World".
In Temple, professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week the students examine apocalyptic topics such as the nuclear war, zombies, virus and chemistry and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread with time," he said, as well as how hypothetic scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could compare themselves with the real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, believeable and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, set up an attended professor of art history and anthropology to offer a course with the simple name "The End of the World".
"We do not take up in 2012 so that we can always keep the option to retain the course in case the world does not go under," said Restall.
Despite the "existing fall" the students have to study, create projects and participate in final audits.
In Penn State, the final examination is carried out on the pre-apocalypse evening, so the students have no other chance to "work on until the night where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," Restall said about his course for high average students who filled with 35 students.
For weeks before semester start, we received e-mails from students who asked if still places were free.
The students on the other hand assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religionsmentality is actually only a question of comfort or of its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa explains for psychology and nurse that he has seen all apocalyptic films.
"Never have I heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the interviewed students - and less a professor - said to believe in the last date of 21 December.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of Mayas, and in some way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never foretold the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in the western society there is an apocalyptic fear that results in several centuries when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Where else people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at the University of La Salle, who teaches the Philippines this year, answers quickly to the question whether he would know a course on the "End of the World".
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an argument to an exception to a higher instance.
We have a reward from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days was spoken by the last court, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "think immediately of a new date" or philosophized that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period, which would bring the end of the world.
Students and professors take this date easy.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrate "the end of the world".
"I might call some friends so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
