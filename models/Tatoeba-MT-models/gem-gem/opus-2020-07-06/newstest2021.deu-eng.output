A security service monitors the procurement.
A total of 174 harvesting aiders were tested positively on the Corona-resistant Sars-CoV-2, as the Dingolfing-Landau Land Council announced on Saturday night.

Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the operation - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large greenhouse, which builds earth bears, gurks, coal and red beet - but only for single glasses.

Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep peace: "After our information it is a closed person's circle".
On the court, infected employees were separated from uninfected employees, the area is now surrounded by a locker.
Green and SPD were responsible for the state government.
The two opposition fractions invited Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect the control of the accommodation of season workers.
"This can be bitterly revenge when such local infection events have to be taken out and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.
This is similar to the SPD: "We have already demanded a special control programme for farms with crop helpers after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof Schlachthof Mitte Mai," said the Environmental Expert Florian of Brunn.
"Especially the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the living conditions must be closely controlled from our viewpoint.
This has obviously not happened."
The outbreak had come "with claim".

Report: Seehofer demands longer storage data
The storage of stock data is currently suspended.
However, Minister Horst Seehofer calls for a renewal of the storage time after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) demands, after a media report, an extended storage of stock data - instead of the ten weeks planned.
As the "Image on Sunday" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change in law.

A decision of the Court of Justice is expected.
But Seehofer wants the amendments before so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A speaker of the Ministry of Justice said the newspaper that it could only be useful to examine whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.

Rejoicing in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball professional of Los Angeles Clippers, is supposed to have left the tournament quartier in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.

The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (a different strip club in Atlanta, D.R.) have the best Wings in the city".
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that the NBA Williams ordered a ten-day quarantine.

South is pronounced by mass infection to the Corona Layer
München - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a theatre for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be seen live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the District of Dingolfing-Landau has shocked authorities and politics.
At the large green farm, nearly 500 harvesting aiders from several countries are currently working, more than one third has been infected with the Corona virus.
The court is now under quarantine and is locked up with a castle.
Nobody can leave the ground, food is delivered.
The well 3300 inhabitants of the municipality now offer the authorities free Corona tests.
Since the harvesting aiders had little contact with local populations, the Country Council has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the court.
"Conscience bitterness": confession of the suspicious firemaker of Nantes
"My client has shown itself cooperatively," said the lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "approved by consciences and very taken into account the extent of destruction".
In the case of a sentence, the man is threatening ten years of prison and a penalty of EUR 150,000.
The Gothic Sankt-Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged by a fire in the night on Saturday last week.
The fire had broke out in three remote places in the church.
Laboratory tests harassed the suspicion of burning.
The suspect who was now imprisoned had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
But after a day he was released again.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese Nantes and was responsible for the closing of the cathedral on the night before the fire.
Since there was no evidence of a violent entrance into the church, he quickly came into the views of the mediators.
Discuss about the elimination of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended to think about the elimination of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss the conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates facts," said Grindel of the "picture on Sunday".
He stressed: "For the associations that can become the most dangerous Bayers and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this way, the debate is not about whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors of associations who want to break into this phalanx."
However, he doubts whether the German Football League is willing to allow majority participations prohibited by the 50+1 rule in the Bundesliga.
"It remains a legal risk to move investment stages to the Bundesliga economic location in a European internal market," Grindel said.
The former DFB-Chapter sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga at the end only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the masterhood".
Even a equal distribution of TV money will not result in a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three associations.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Increasingly, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and stuck through the press instead of responding to me," Grindel said about the adoption of a expensive clock that had led to his withdrawal in April 2019.
"I've already been very busy in human terms."
He had received the gift in value of about 1,000 euros from an Ukrainian functioner.
"I have committed an infringement of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences from it," said Grindel.
"With the ominous watch gift, I was completely transparent and angry.
Many in the DFB knew of it."
He never made "a heal from the gift", the 58-year-old assured.
"This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Argentina rejects the counterparty of creditors
The new claims could not be fulfilled, the Ministry of Economics in Buenos Aires informed on Saturday.
"It would not only be irresponsible but also unjust," said an opinion.
"When 50 percent of the children live in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our believers."
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer durable under the current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina urges its private creditors to quit some of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (approximately 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country again threatens the state pledge.
It would be the ninth fall of payment in Argentina's history.
Lastly, creditors had demanded higher interest rates on state loans and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine Government holds its last offer and is not prepared for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate last amounted to more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power by about ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to compensate interest claims of 503 million US dollars and had thus resulted in a limited loss of payments.
Professional arrived - not yet private
"It's running super good" - this section draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end, everything went very quickly: In the middle of May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will follow Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelder Notariat site.
Even six weeks later, beginning of July, the promovated lawyer took up the work, the normal day business runs long on full tours.
"I still have to arrive," she explains and laughs in conversation with the Redtaler advertiser.
Of course, the short premature time has not been enough to completely move the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelder, reports the infant dingolfingerin.
She is now looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city with her husband, who is working as a judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg.
At least her husband had been able to apply for a short-term parental period to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to need every day from Regensburg from pendels, she sometimes has an overnight possibility with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
The city of Eggenfelden has, of course, grown up in the neighboring country circle.
When visiting locally with her family in the past months, she recently found: "Eggenfelder is a really beautiful small town".
It was much more pleased that she had made the race for the free office in the selection procedure.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career, the Netherlands plays a central role in her home: after the Law Study in Passau, she performed her referendum time and the second state degree in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notarassessorin, including in Rehau and Hof in Upperfranc, Babenhausen in Underallgäu and Regensburg, she also trained "now" the promotion in labour law - in 2012 she became an notelin in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
In 2016 she went to parenthood, it finally followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she took over representative services in various notariats.
When the body in Eggenfeldes had been proclaimed because of the nearing retirement of Lutz Feller, it had seen the right time for full professional recovery, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessors, who will take over the vacation representation at the Notariat site, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has just a commendation for the team of the Chancellor: "It's running super good!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded procedures here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private food point.
In the case of children's gardens and cripples, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here soon - and to meet the most beautiful jogging stretches of the Rottal.
BVB plans for the Liga start with a maximum of 15.000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football city in Dortmund will not be filled with 20 percent for seasonal start in the case of a fan return.
"Because of the distance system that is compulsory, we are planning with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer at the "Tagesspiegel".
Usually, the Arena in the district city is a little more than 81,000 audiences at Bundesliga games.
In the spirit games caused by the Corona pandemic during the last season, the BVB per party lost about four million euros.
The Cramer responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at the BVB hopes that, besides normal viewers, some of the around 4000 places can be opened again in the hospitality area: "It is of course a strike to the office if these revenues are completely broken away".
In view of the persistent Corona crisis, "all are currently advised to take a stable side length for the first time".
"If many companies do not work well and 6.8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, the need for entertainment is limited," explained Cramer.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chief praised the BVB Professional for their salary loss to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in Merchandising on short work."
Small miracles: Early start into life with a few hundred grams
Harder than a packerl butter, just once three pots of blood in his entire body: This was Gabriel when he was born - he was just weighing 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 earlys that are cared for every year at the Grazer Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weighs less than 1,500 grams, a few - such as Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even one kilogram birth weight.
They are born so small and so early that no lung, no darm, nor muscles are fully trained.
Your skin is sometimes so delicate that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear pump clothes and especially for them made mini winds.
But not so small that they wouldn't be with voice - "and like," Berndt Urlesberger swallows.
"Although, of course, they don't cry as loud as big babies."
When the Whiteboard becomes stage
Despite the Corona Theatre in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the St. Jakobus gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actor Julia Sylvester from the theatre of the city of Aalen presented the students the production of "The Home Dress" by video.
Afterwards, students were able to exchange their students by Skype with the actor and director Winfried Tobias about the piece and performance.
The idea was born for the performance format from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the teaching.
Although at the end all participants agreed that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage room would still offer additional recreation, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could become an interesting addition to the game operation," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.

Kalbitz-Rauswurf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the viewpoint of the FDP only a "fish leave" and does not change anything in the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the legal exams in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said the FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The AfD Bundesschiedsgericht had on Saturday in Stuttgart confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board had decided in May by majority.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD Group in the Brandenburg Landtag.
"If it would really be the AfD to remove legal extremists consistently from their party, functioners such as Björn Höcke as well as its followers would have long been excluded," said Strasser.
"In this regard, however, there is no political will in the AfD, because legal extremism is now part of the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz remains excluded now, says nothing and does not change anything," he said the "World on Sunday".
"It speaks rather bands, how many of the frenetic supporters still have a legal extrem in the middle of the AfD."
The flower assumes that the AfD will return to less than five percent in elections.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the leaders of the officially dissolved "fleelders" around the Thüringer AfD-Landes and Group Chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection constituents the radiation as "protected right-extremistic pursuit".
In May, the AfD Federal Board had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, Kalbitz did not indicate a former membership of the currently prohibited legal exams "Heimattroue Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and of the Republicans at his party entry.
Kalbitz contests the membership of the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left Group at the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also pointed out that the decision of the Bundesschiedsgericht did not change anything in the character of the AfD: "The Wolf has only eaten crijde.
The AfD remains a legally extreme party, whether with or without Kalbitz."
This decision will neither weaken the Bundespartei nor the right wings.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troop is visible.
You want to avoid further observation through constitutional protection and try to pass through the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD won't let the spirits she called out.
A rape is still not changing," commented Brandenburger SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD Landsverband and the Group held their right leader until today."
The legal controversy about the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
On Saturday he announced that he would act civilly against the decision of the Federal Court of Justice.
North Sea Wind Parks deliver well 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea have poured electricity into the network in the first six months of the year 11.51 terawatt hours.
These are about 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator informed Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for transferring the North Sea Structure to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The wind plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have also preserved 2,22 terawatt hours (TWh).
Overall, the wind current from the North and East Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to well 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
Thus, the windsheet on the sea represents almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany; these are about four percentage points more than one year ago.
New wind parks ensure higher production capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is a result of higher production capacity in addition to the wind conditions, as new wind parks have gone to the net in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running with full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatt electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient, according to tennet at 7.1 gigawatt.
It should rise to 17 Gigawatt in the German North Sea until 2030.
"In Germany and the Netherlands we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said tennet business leader Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind parks can't use their capacity on sea, but reaches about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea Wind Parks generated more than six gigawatt electricity.
The North Sea wind wheels averagely produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide nearly seven million households with electricity.

Freital: Windberg Festival cancelled because of Corona
The Windberg Festival does not take place this year.
The city of Freital has celebrated the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and - in consciousness of how difficult it is economically for the participants - hoped until the last minute," explained Chief Mayor Uwe Rumberg (particularly).
"But finally we are here responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
For if tens of thousands had flowed to the festive and to the festival, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact follow-up could not be met in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the limitations would have been so strong that there would not be much left from a national festival.
In addition, the organizational and surveillance effort would increase unproportionately by multiple times.
Rumberg trusted next year.
Then the city Freital celebrates its 100-year-old existence with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.

Future more flightlots in Worms
The Wormser University continues to play: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" creates a professional for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS was now signed in Worms.
The Treaty was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professional, it is possible not only to start the study in the summer but also for the winter semester.
Thus, twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacity of the DFS will be equally charged both in the university and at the DFS.
The DFS will advise the university in the establishment and occupation of the professional.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been at the University of Worms at the Air Traffic Management course in the course of their courses.
This year, nine students started.
The experiences of the DFS have been very positive, the performance of students are excellent.
The combination of study and lottery training contributes significantly to increasing the attractiveness of the Lotsen profession.
"In these times, the promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we are sure that air traffic is recovered and grows again in the long term.
In future, we need highly qualified staff to be able to fulfil our legal task," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS in the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the professor of the Foundation is a future-safe investment, which will provide long-term flights with a wide, technically cross-scale knowledge basis.
We therefore continue good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as employer."
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms: "The foundation professor is an important bridge between science and economy.
With her we want to link to the existing cooperation with the DFS German air security as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor study process Air Traffic Management".
The trust of German air carriers is for the University of Worm's motivation and commitment to further expand their teaching and research competence in the future fields of air transport.
In use for tomorrow's flight lots, the university with the first foundation professor for a dual course can set very special highlights and innovative focusses for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, stresses: "The University of Worms has a unique position in Rhineland-Pfalz with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the Cooperation Treaty strengthens the profile of the university".
Salvation hookers land on the A 45
Around 30 minutes the A 45 motorway was fully locked in the direction of Aschaffenburg on Saturday after a traffic accident of the rescue helicopters.
A 76-year-old traveled straight out with a Ford at 12.40 o'clock in the Alzenau-Midde exit in the curve and landed at the guide plank.
As a result, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered mild injuries in the face and had to be brought to a hospital for treatment.

The damaged vehicle, which caused a damage of about 2000 euros, had to be disposed of.
Heil wants to check other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis reaffirmed the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Legislative reinforcements are in the forefront.
But are they right - and will it remain?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) intends to review other sectors, in accordance with the strict rules which are now planned to combat abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective sector if necessary," said Heil of the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer already warns to restrict work contracts in general.
After the massive Corona outbreak at Fleischriesen Tonnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet will decide a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
Great slaughterhouses are no longer allowed to use foreign staff for slaughter, depletion and meat processing.
It is intended to prohibit the use of work contractors and employers there.
The employer President Ingo Kramer said to the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction of contracts and leave of workers if you don't want to defeat the economy completely."
Work contracts, for example, are compulsory for wide ranges of craft, construction industry and plant construction.
"The mistakes of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Salvation assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are meaningful.
"If an industrial company commands a craftsman to build a safety facility, this is a very normal work contract".
The German meat industry considers a prohibition of contracts and leisure work alone in its industry as non-constitutional.
It is not possible to explain why the portion and packaging of cheese should apply to other labour rights than to worst, it says in an opinion on the legislative project, as reported in the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" ( Saturday).
Accordingly, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Many Eastern European employees from work contracting companies worked in the industry after the results of a review of NRW work protection management partly 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Loans were included for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these had been assembled by "tricky constructions".
"Now we need to clear out fundamentally."
The politician announced: "The labour protection law, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, is also measures not only relating to the meat industry, such as higher test rates in the field of labour protection or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
The DPA draft contains amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry and the labour protection law.
Brandenburg's Minister for Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers that more intensive checks are necessary.
"I would like to make more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal protection, everything possible, for example animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg current".
However, for more controls, more staff are also needed.
Three dead in the event of a crash of Ultraleight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people died during the crash of an ultrasound aircraft to a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
A child had been easily hurt.
Two more people were saved in the accident, said a speaker of the Wesel Circle Corporation.
The police have found a fallscreen at the accident site.
The "Rheinian Post" reported, calling on eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collapsed with a hot air balloon.
The house is a single or two-familie house.
More details were not known at first.
Cleaning of Frankfurter Opernplatz peaceful
One week after the expulsions in Frankfurt, the space of the Opernplatz is also peaceful in the night on Sunday.
Lastly, a few dozens of people stayed in the place, but left him before the opening of the locker hour at 1 o'clock.
Since the early evening, the police have been working with numerous officials, seeing a larger police order in the entire city area.
The first time this weekend, from midnight, was a ban on the opera site, on which it had arrived at Krawallen a week ago.
Police had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of celebrates.
At least five officials were injured after police inputs, several police vehicles damaged.
The night to Saturday was also quiet.
Car surpasses: Young woman severely hurt at Hofgeismar in case of accident on Bundesstraße 83
In the event of an accident between Schöneberg and Hampe, a 21-year-old suffered severe injuries on Sunday at 13.25 o'clock.
She was brought to the Klinikum Kassel.
With heat cameras, the firearm sought possible accompanyers.
According to the police on the Bundesstraße 83, the woman was on the way towards her dwelling place when her car came from the motorway from unexplained cause and several times crossed herself.
In order to save the unhappy ones, the firearm had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether someone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent maize field was picked up from the turning leader with a heat camera.
The drohnen staffels from Warburg, also working with heat cameras, had also been ordered for the people's searches.
However, the use forces did not find anyone between the high maize plants.
The grave injured was brought to the Kasseler Klinikum with the rescue car.
Nearly 50 forces of the firearm Hofgeismar, Humme and Schöneberg were on site.
The Bundesstraße was locked for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a releasing gate by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin for the ninth time in series has secured the Italian mastership.
The team around the five-fold World Footballer made the total 36th Scudetto of the Association History perfect with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genua.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, who attacked Sami Khedira without the last long injured ex-national player, is no longer pushing out two play days before the end of the series A season.
The Inter Milano Table second is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half time, then Ronaldo met after a release variant with the last action.
An example of Miralem Pjanic, the 35-year-old used directly from the Criminal Border with a flat shot (45.+7).
On 2:0 Ronaldo was also involved against the now opener guests, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67.) was dusted off.
This guaranteed the glanceless but decisive success.
The foulelf meter cast to the late in the 89th minute may only have been correctly overlooked by Ronaldo itself with a view to the Torjager rating.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically on ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are weird, and the moment changes very easily," said Trainer Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turins had not yet been able to make the mastership perfect.
At the end, Juve was also due to the weakness of competitors.
For in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had succeeded only five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will be the king of Torshut, it is questionable.
For while the Portuguese superstar had reached 31 gates, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile after his three pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the table-fired Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona had already 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the FC Bayern title win.
The record in Italy holds the current Juve Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentinian reached 36 gates for the SSC Naples during the season 2015/2016.
In August, the "old lady" of the Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus stands in the eight-final of the Champions League, however, on August 7 against Olympique Lyon, has to accelerate a 0:1 to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal authors
Stuttgart - Allen threatened penalties and judgments despite the fact that car drivers continue to gas in countless illegal races on the bathing worttemberg roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal authors in the southwest.
There are no comparison values for the previous years, but the Rasers are increasingly working to the judicial authorities: In the state prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim, in 2018 a total of 155 investigation procedures were conducted for illegal races, a year later it was already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The race was less concerned with organized events, as the reply of the Ministry of Interior to a request from the Landtags SPD.
In most cases, the drivers would be spontaneous against each other or they would have escaped from the police - also this is indicated as illegal race.
The tax was mainly German men aged between 18 and 60 years.
113 Penalties - 15 times imprisonment
Only in relatively few cases the Rasers are caught and also asked for the cash: Since 2018, a total of 113 penalties have been imprisoned and 15 freedom penalties have been imposed.
However, there are no points that the number of illegal authors actually increases.
Instead, other drivers responded more sensitive than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of the past years and showed more frequently, said a ministerial speaker.
Especially popular in Rasern, the motorway 8. Always re-brems car drivers there the traffic to provide space and use the free route for a race.
In August, there was a dozen driver near Kirchheim under Teck, even 18 drivers on the A8 in Merklingen three months earlier.
A81 is the most popular "racing line"
On the A81, the police even register more races than any other Bundesbahn.
With a tempo limit there is attempted to brake the Raser on the particularly affected section between bindings and geisings.
The most high-price sports and luxury carosses often have Swiss marks because the drivers deviate to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and authoring in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the tempo limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres, we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport experts of the SPD country-day fraction.
"The hemm threshold for Raser would be considerably higher if you couldn't be legally with 200 kilometres and more on the road here and there".
From information or image campaigns, Rivoir minders: "He who is so distinguished over all the rules and is not only at stake in his own life, but also in the lives of other traffic participants is hardly reachable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger interference of the police
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that Raser does not be afraid of the tempolimits," says Holger Bach, Head of Department of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and harder checks on the routes concerned.
It is not rare to get painful and serious from the high-tourious force fair: since January 2019 and until April 2020 three people died in the races, of which two unparticipants in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's inner city and one in Gerlingen.
There, in November, two young men would have given themselves an end of authorship.
One of the vehicles came from the street, pralled against a garden wall and remained on the side, the 18-year-old accompanyer died.
21 more people were injured in the races of the last two years.
Increased penalties, however, are not necessary by Minister Thomas Strobl: "In order to sanction illegal vehicle races more harder, it is not seen," says the Interministerial Paper.

Illegale Tuning-Treffen in Nürnberg: Only a small part from the "scenario"
The officials were at the top of about 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police bilancing.
However, only a small part of the attendants of the Autoposer and Tuningscene should be assigned.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene came to the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the local vehicles and individuals, it should be assumed that these were mostly spectacular.
In addition, the main share of the presents remained in the existing infectious protection provisions, in particular the maintenance of the minimum distance and the carrying of a mouth nasal protection.

Numbers of the Agency: 900 suspicions of short-work abuse
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Work (BA) is, according to its own statement, investigating about 900 suspicions of abuse in short-working money.
"This is extremely little in the case of more than 880,000 companies who have shown short work," said the Executive Director Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung".
As at the beginning of the Corona crisis suddenly had requested very many companies short work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually the test takes up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available for us in this hot phase.
The more precise we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a few more things.
We're not naive and have a long breath."
Indications of abuse often come from the employers or trade unions concerned.
Besides, use the BA Analysis Software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency twin in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The estimates are disagreed, but we are waxing in the case of the case and are now training our employees in the work agencies for editing applications for insolvency money."
The numbers are still unattended, said Terzenbach.

The focus on the new infections is Vienna and Upper Austria.

London (dpa) - The English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured the third table space by a 2:0 (0:0) result against the direct competitor Leicester City on the last game day of the Premier League.

Somester United was headed by Bruno Fernandes' penalties (71 minutes).
Following a red map for Leicester City in the afterlife, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) met to the final level.
Chelsea, in the Champions-League-Achtelfinal opponent of the FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"Trainer Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cups against Arsenal during his first season as Chelsea Coach, said: "This is very important to me."
From Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton, Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from a magnificent 1:1 (1:0) at the Crystal Palace and started as a sixth in the Europe League.
Aston Villa decided with the FC Watford and the AFC Bournemouth for himself, however, that West Ham United had to crawl for a long time.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84). Andrej Jarmolenko (85).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, who skaded three trainers during the season, is rising after five firstling years.
Just like Bournemouth, which couldn't save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at the FC Everton.
At the end, a point was missing.
The FC Liverpool, which has been found as an English master since the end of June, has secured a union record with a 3:1 (1:1) -Sig at Newcastle United.

Arrest and violence in demonstrations against Netanjahu
The protests in Israel against the Head of Government of Netanjahus become increasingly vigorous.
In the night, there have been violent conflicts.
The Israeli police took violent action in the night to Sunday in Jerusalem against participants of a demonstration against the legal commander Benjamin Netanjahu.
Twelve people were arrested because of their involvement in distress, police speaker Micky Rosenfeld informed.
The police used, among other things, water lighters to dissolve the announcement.
In total, according to media reports on Saturday evening, about 6,000 people were gathered near Netanjahus office.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanjahus handling the Corona crisis.
The protesters hit drums, blew in horns, and called Netanjahu to return.
There were also participants in a counterdemonstration that supported Netanjahu, reported the news page "ynet".
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the private villa of the Head of Government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested after police statements near Tel Aviv because it is suspicious to have sprayed from a driving car pepper spray on demonstrators on the road edge.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a demonstration in the south of the country.
The demonstrant had easily been hurt at the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have last been several demonstrations against Netanjahu.
The announcements accompany the corruption process against the Head of Government.
Netanjahu was also criticized for his management of the Corona crisis.
It will be preserved, inter alia, for fast locking and a lack of preparation for a second Corona mill.
The Corona crisis has hardly added the economy of the country.
The unemployment rate last amounted to more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the Corona virus in Israel last grew to ever new record values.

Several rescue cars brought them to a surrounding hospital.
North Korea locks border city after Corona suspicion
North Korea has so far seen a "bright success" in its own measures to protect the corona virus.
Now, the country reports for the first time about a suspect.
Due to a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely locked a large city out of fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological prevention measures in the past six months, "the malicious virus could have been brought into the country," reported the state media.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency situation had been impaired.
The Communist leadership called out the highest alarm level.
If the suspicion was confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the cast country.
North Korea had not previously registered any single infection, according to its own data, and described its restraint measures as "blooding success".
The information was doubted in abroad.
The symptoms of disease were reported in a "extractor" who illegally crossed the military marking line between South and North Korea on July 19th.
The person has left to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the crossing of the border within the four kilometres wide and mostly reduced military buffer zone, there was no confirmation from South Korea at first.
However, South Korea's military, according to reports from the National News Agency, Yonhap admitted the possibility of illegal crossing to North Korea as high.
It was carried out investigations to some people.
North Korea, according to its own information on Saturday due to the suspicion of a urgency meeting of the Labour Party Polit Office, chaired by powermaster Kim Jong Un.
The "threatening situation in Kaesong could cause a fatal and destructive disaster".
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a precautionary measure to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and region from others", it continued.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had contact with it, had been placed under quarantine.
The central military Commission of the Party is therefore to examine the "extinction" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, where appropriate, to impose harsh punishment.
In Kaesong, it is estimated that about 300,000 people live.
Tension before Council session: City East and noise protection are still in front of a great summer break to discuss
"In addition to environmental topics, the members of the bodies will also vote on the construction plan for the major project Interior Development East", it says in the middle of the city press release to the next municipal meeting on Tuesday 28 July at 16.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city will be debated controversially until the end.
The majority of the committees are little, at last even rejecting in individual committees depending on their presence.
A call from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), which has been developed from the citizenship and then developed by the administration and municipal council now not to fail to prepare after nearly ten years, project advocate Reinhard Klein criticized as "external parliamentary opposition", "no idea", "speculation", "revolution" and "conscious false statements".
"All think it's better to know," so small, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Citizens' list Pforzheim.
In fact, after reading the Treaties in this position, he is "I know what I'm talking about".
The outturn gets cheaper to the city, the Technical City House is to be refined for 8.5 million euros in line with the statements of the city administration by grants of which little is convinced of.
The city will develop quite differently than it is predicted in the City Hall and on the side of the favourites from the economy.
To create the City by its own power and not a investor: that is his plan B. One day after small, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also refuses the project, presented an alternative concept.
It essentially also provides for the renovation of the Technical Council House, the opening of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller interior transformation in the ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental topics play a key role
In addition, environmental topics will play a key role.
The Council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise burdens caused by road traffic, including frequent temporal reductions.
In a press release, Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, the political responsibilities in the city are not innocent of this because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus the noise, according to the VCD.
The Council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda of the accession to the Baten-Württemberg Conservation Pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the urban child-day facilities and the request for entry into the smart-City promotion of the federal.
Citizens are welcome, but Corona's protection measures must be maintained.
With a lot of delay Tim Zimmermann starts to the new season
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann starts in his premierensaison at ADAC GT Masters on July 31th.
Before the liga of the supersportwagen can take up the regular operation, the first test trips were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has for a long time prevented Tim Zimmermann from attacking his first service trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan by Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premieres in the GT3 car.
"There are some things that are different from the Porsche from the presaison," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go differently to the curves.
But it really made a lot of fun."
Roomman also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite its only 25 years, the Netherlands has been experienced in the GT sport and has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I am not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand faintly and we have made enormous progress at the Lausitzring session to session."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From July 31, the 33 super sports cars will run through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series new ones, knows the route.
He was the last guest in the Motodrom in 2015.
"It worked quickly, and I had to get used to the route," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passports that you need to meet optimally to be fast."
How fast roomman is then really, this appears in two weeks.
"The teams poker, of course, a little at the tests," he says.
"Since, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the record of a closely pushed calendar.
Up to the beginning of November, there are seven races.
Current stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In the mid-August of Nürburgring, the former Niko Hülkenberg pilot will take into the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister for Transport of Quarantäne Decision cold caught
According to press reports, the decision of the British Government to put Spain-Orlaubers in quarantine for two weeks after their return, has taken the transport minister of the country cold.
Thus, Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided the action on Saturday.
Due to the climbing corona numbers in Spain, the London Cabinet stretched the country from the list of countries from which there is no quarantine charge.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so that Shapps will also need to return to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also undertaken quarantine measures for returners.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the first day of vacation, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
Moreover, Spain is considered to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria until now.
"Tal-rich ministers should have known beforehand that there is the possibility that a quarantine will be held for vacations in Spain," commented the Labour Member Diane Abbot.
"But apparently nobody has made the effort to tell Grant Shapp's story."
Nearly one month after the end of the Corona note in Spain and the expiry of the strict starting blocks, the number of infections in the country rises again.
Virologists are mainly responsible for nightlife for the recent spread.
Spain belongs to the British most popular holiday countries.
From unnecessary travels to the Spanish Festival, the British Government currently recommends that the most popular Canary and Balearic Islands are excluded from the British holidays.
In Spain more than 272,000 infections have been registered with the new corona virus and more than 28,000 deaths.

According to Johns-Hopkins University, some 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the Corona pandemy.
Abbott called for caution to people who had to leave their houses.
They should not disregard practices "which we used to", such as we carrying masks, said the governor according to the broadcaster CBS.

"Douglas" moves to Hawaii

The Hurrican centre, however, expected to continue to weaken.
According to the predictory, he should be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the Hurrican threshold.
This year, after a prediction of May, NOAA expected an excessive active orrican season over the Atlantic.
From June to the end of November, up to ten orkans would be expected, of which up to six very strong turbines could become, the Authority had explained.
In average, there are six orriques over the Atlantic per year, three of them develop to storms of great strength.
In view of the availability of climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season was only 30 percent, even less than 10 percent, said then.
U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government monitored the storms and contacted the states concerned.
Four gates known: Video Assistant "refused" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuricic was known as two gates
Neapel - Four gates achieved, four gates known: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a black evening at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football League series A - and was really anxious to the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival not given gates for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never done so hard against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Neapel had been headed by a gate of external defendant Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32th minute Philip Djuricic first celebrated the compensation.
The video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back because of an abstract position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball again in the network - again attacked the VAR.
The gates of the attacker Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) also took the arbitrary team back, according to the VAR.
In the afterlife, Allan made the 2:0 end for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.

The new technology provides records," says the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern München: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparatory phase for the Champions League began with a relapse for double winner FC Bayern.
After a short vacation and a few training days, Hansi Flick has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the violation of World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The French man, who has the third most intake minutes behind Captain Manuel Neuer and Head of the Middle Field Joshua Kimmich, suffered a band injuries on the left foot root and threatens to lack in decisive king class duellen.
In the Munchner Schmuddelwetter, the legal defender broke a training game and was driven from the place with a golf map.
How long the unlimited family player has to pause in the fight around the title is open.
An effort in the eight-final backing game against the FC Chelsea on August 8 is likely to be difficult, for the final tournament starting in Lisbon on August 12, the 24-year-old.
The Bayers do not want to be stopped from the miserableness of training on Sunday.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are intended to show its victorious title collectors in the ideal 28 days to the end of the king's class on August 23.
"We have simply mastered the responsibilities with mastership and Pokal.
Now it is necessary to create the special ones," said Flick.
Until the coins are able to explicitly deal with the final tournament and before a training camp at the Algarve, the eight-final plane is on the FC Chelsea for the first time.
After the 3:0 in the past Corona break, the Londons in the home arena should not become the Bavarian Albtraum again as in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
"We have to go through the doors for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and trust thought with a good game," Flick demanded.
A test for consensus is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long talk, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, on an unusual August.
31 players welcomed him at the Sabener Street, including the new actors for precious shopping Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the place after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has been well inserted like all new ones," reported Flick.
But instead of talking about the new season, if Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to train, Flick would rather talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of single and small groups training is now trained in team strength for the Londons, which are in contrast to the Flick ensemble in the game rhythm.
Then the coins could present a quarterfinal against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finale are real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "isn't so easy," the Chief Coach stressed, who can trust in the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The WM recorder protector Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparations, which is particularly relevant to the 0-to-100 consensus.
With his current team, work was "a pleasure", Flick praised.
"Focussity on profits" is an impressive characteristic of his team.
At the tournament with nine-manships, it was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the performers were involved, including the immigrant Thiago and the defender David Alaba, whose stay is not secured beyond the royal season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to shorten her world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be travelled, the FIA must improvise to forgive the WM titles.
All American races were cancelled, though.
Renal calendar becomes more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula-1 season continues to accept form.
The Grand Prix, which has been confirmed until now, came three further races during the week.
In October, Nürburgring is intended to be travelled in Germany and in Portuguese Portimão.
On the first November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. fight WM points on the Italian tradition separation in Imola.
This includes the 2020 Renn calendar at current level 13 runs.
"We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in the completion of our plans for the 2020 season," said Formula-1-Boss Chase Carey.
Overall, in this extraordinary season 15 to 18 races will be completed in the royal class of motor sports.
Finally, the Formula 1 wants its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the official race in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports may still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules of Procedure calls for races to three continents
The Rules of Formula 1 require the granting of the World Championship at least races on three continents.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
With a special rule, the FIA wants to give the titles to "exceptional circumstances" due to the corona virus pandemic.
The traditional seasonal start in Australia in March had to be cancelled short-term due to the corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a subject.
In addition, the formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Absay is criticizing in Brazil
Because of the excited Corona situation, the races in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil will not take place.
"We look forward to being with them again during the next season," said Carey.
The absage of the American race was primarily criticized in Brazil: "The abstention was not surprising for us, but we cannot accept the reasons for this," said Tamas Rohonyi, Promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the number of infections in the area of São Paulo is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not to want to drive in Brazil would also not justify a statement.
You should be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view of Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with the US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was in the well-known latenight show by Stephen Colbert via video switch to guests and told her what she had in her interview at her meeting with Donald Trump.
Climateatkivistin Greta Thunberg was by video switch to guest in a popular US-Latenight show.
Among other things, she told about her fight against the powers of the world.
The teenager also talked about her famous "whole look" at her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - During the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg emphasized her impatient effort for the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans in the future and her meeting with the US President Donald Trump at the UN Climate Summit last year.
Ladight-Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg in your mission on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She spoke not only of her fight against climate change but also of her conflict with the powers of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to distract the focus from the climate crisis," they shake.
"All things from organized hate campaigns to threats, only because a group of children go on the road" she experienced.
Heads of State and leading politicians who spotted against them in social media or even trying to make them silent, she finds her "willing" as she shows the reactions "when they have no other answer".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she was throwing a bitter look behind the U.S. president Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the actwise sailed across the Atlantic, her impressive view was caught by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip, an GIF, i.e. an animated image, which eventually became one of the most common images used for Trump agents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at this moment?
On the relatively open question of Stephen Colbert, she only answered shortly undry: "To be honest, I think that does not require any further explanation."
The experienced Satyrist Colbert had probably not counted with the cracked answer and disappeared a little laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she kept many in mind at the Climate Conference.

Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a retreat: after a fast upstairs with Fleetwood Mac, it went steep down and then slowly up.
Now the Bluesrock Guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, Drug Junkie, Cult trailer: The co-founder of the Band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He had died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73 years, family members announced in an official opinion on Saturday that an additional opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton appreciated Green as one of the best Blues and Rockgitarrists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in a emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the Band Fleetwood Mac.
The killer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-term legendary band in London in 1967 until today his dreamed instrumental-hit "Albatross".
The life of the musician ("The End of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a trailer trip.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated its greatest success, but then without him.
Among other things, there should have been disputes because Green wanted to spend all the profits of the group for good purposes.
He began to appear in wide clothes and with great crusifix.
Psychiatric problems should also have played a role.
Three years after the foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
It followed a social decline.
The Bluesrock Guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biografs reported.
Green was treated in psychiatry for a long time.
During a large part of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the picturesheet.
He is supposed to live on the street for a while, as a cemetery gardener and have spent a time in an Israeli Kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as a son of a Jewish worker family in the London City of Bethnal Green.
He was enthusiastic for American blood musicians, such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At eleven years, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began to play a professional guitar and received five years later the opportunity to stand on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later he was engaged in the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues-Boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his bluesbreakers-collage Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
In winter 1968/69, the Green composed song "Albatross" announced the group the first number-1-hit and catapulated it to the top of the British music scene.
But the fast rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not handle the media rummel, his experiments with the Drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number-1-hit".
By the end of the decade, Green 1979 came surprisingly to a respect result with a album inspired by religious topics.
Fleetwood Mac swims without him in new formation on a success wave.
Their album "Rumours" published in 1977 sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo results, Green did not get a bigger comeback until he started with a group of friends in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returning to the earth.
Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band in 2004 dissolved.
For music experts, he was already a blues-learning - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists in recent decades.
