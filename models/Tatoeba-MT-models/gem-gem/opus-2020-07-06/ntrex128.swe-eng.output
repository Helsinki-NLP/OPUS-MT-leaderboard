AM in Wales is worried to "be like puckon"
Some AM, members of the Wales National Assembly, are confused by a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal is planned to change the name of the National Assembly to the parliament of Wales.
AM throughout the political spectrum is worried about being ridiculated.
A AM for Labour said that his group was worried because "it's rimming with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who cannot Whale: Twp means stupid in Whale's and pwp means bajs.
A AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "dissatisfied" and has proposed other options.
A conservative waleser said that his group is "open" for the change of name, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is expressed in W in Whale like the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, currently compiling legislation for the change of name, said: "The final decision for what the members of the congregation should be called is so clear to the members themselves."
Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Congregation the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the House of Wales.
The valid title of AM the Commission proposed the Welsh Parliament Members (members of the Wales Parliament) or WMP, but MWP received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AM obviously proposes other options, but problems with reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, which is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendment within a few weeks.
The legislative framework for the amendments also includes other amendments to how the congregation works, including rules for disqualifying an AM and the design of the committee system.
AM will vote on what they should be called when they discuss legislation.
Macedonia shall carry out a referendum amending its name
On Sunday, the voters shall vote on if they are to change the name of the country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to terminate a dispute that has been held for decades with the neighbouring country Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the change of name and has said that he will disregard the result.
However, the followers of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change of name is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silences when the churches in Harlem hit problems
"Older people I'm talking to say there was a bar and a church on each corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"Now there's neither."
He said it's understandable that the bars disappear.
"Some people are associating in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Barer is no longer like the area's living room, where people go on a regular basis."
The true churches he is worried that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as far as the leaders are waiting and that "early or later they will fall on box one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with property apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to all the churches being closed, since those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropol – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a bojcott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to employ or promote black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson’s congregation planned renovation, they also built the clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the music game "the watches of the poor".
The expert who played the clock game in July had another name for it: "A cultural tax" and "a incomplete historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the bigger watch game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's are a complex history with architects and entrepreneurs – some hired by the church's playmates, others by the episcopal foundation.
The church office – the governing body of the congregation, composed of lekhes — wrote to the Foundation in July and expressed an concern that the foundation would "approve the cost" to the church meeting, although the church meeting had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and entrepreneurs.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Hay hurts 13-year-old who pops after humber in California
During Saturday, a shark attacked and damaged a 13-year-old boy who popped after lobster in California on the first day of the Hummer season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had diving with his friends for a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to find a lobster, but then he realized that the boy screamed, "I've been biten!"
"I've been biten!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the whole key leg had been cut up.
"I cried to everyone to get up from the water." "It's a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was flew to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is stated to be critical.
It's unclear what shark it was.
The Larry Giles bathing officer told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it had been found that it wasn't a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim had trauma damage on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swaami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours by reason of investigation and safety.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's enters the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with houselike beauty paths with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the falling mode and household market, the larger beauty gaps will be tested in 11 stores over the country and implemented in more shops next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the quick purchase attempts to fill the shelves that were previously taken up by TV appliances, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury's said they're going to double their beauty offering up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offers from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have greater space with selected areas, such as stores like Boots.
The shop chain also launches its boutique mink brand again so that most of the products are vague – as more and more young customers require.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test in two Sainsbury's stores – the first stand opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend of buying less food every day in local shops means that fast purchases have to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their shops will look more and more like houses in an attempt to fight cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl with more services and other products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stand in hundreds of shops and has also acquired a number of Habitat stands since they bought both chains two years ago, which, according to them, has increased sales of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The quick buyer's previous attempt to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facial lift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a cooperation with Boots at the beginning of the 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a dispute on how Boot's sales revenue would be distributed.
The new strategy will be after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy activity with 281 shops to Celesio, owned by the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million for three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an extended range of luxurious skin care products, including brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial boss, said: "We have given our beauty paths a new look and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all the needs, and with an attractive environment in swift places we are now a attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones "razing" after Holly Willoughby pulls out of the deal of £11 million
Dragons Den-Stern Peter Jones is "razing" because the TV-presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal of £11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't get with their brand Truly, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
This Morning representative, 37, announced his decision at Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den-Stern Peter Jones angry by pulling out their luxurious lifestyle brand in the last minute – to focus on its new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "razing" at an excited meeting at his business empire's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire in Tuesday when the TV favorite acknowledged that her new contracts – worth up to $1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand Truly, with leisure clothing and accessories.
The activity has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced she left Truly at Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was clearly the main priority of Holly.
It would be her long-term future for the coming decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
Nobody could believe it happened in Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a stock full of goods that are ready to be sold at the headquarters of Marlow."
Experts believe that The Morning's decision to withdraw may cost the company several millions due to significant investments in everything from cauters and lights to clothing, as well as the risk of further delays in launching.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Trebarnmamman Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as President in March.
The couple celebrate together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production companies.
Willoughby will be a trademark ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business."
Tough talk, "and then we fell in love."
He was joking that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "unworthy a president" and because he was so positive about the leaders of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a "new anchor voice":
"I didn't give up anything."
He said that Kim wants to have a second meeting after Trump commended their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have run firmly.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "equivalent response" from the United States after the first disarmament stage of North Korea.
He noted that instead, the United States continues sanctions intended to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to its followers.
"It's great with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a grand relationship."
He said that his attempt to improve relations with Kim has had positive results – an end to rocketsters, liberated hostages, and returned remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It is so easy to behave as a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to enter this packed arena we would have about 200 people here," said Trump and pointed to the audience before him.
Tsunami and earthquake destroy the island of Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake on Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had lost their homes, there was no exceptional permit required for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which complicates all of it," said Ms Sumbung.
Save the children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear if foreign staff can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the Bureau for Natural Catastrophe, said that Indonesian officials evaluated the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the anger of nature.
It has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastal lines.
The lack of a tsunami warning series in Palu, although a warning had been issued, likely contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters complicate logistics further.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia's broken infrastructure in its election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and railroads.
But inadequate funding has caused Mr. Joco's administration before next year's elections.
Mr. Joko is also pressed by persistent sectarist tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs struggled on the streets with macakes, pilgrims, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge quitted in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a 89th minute goal in Stamford Bridge in London at Saturday.
Sturridge got a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team was behind with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick to the other chair.
The attempt fled high over the target area towards the top right corner of the network.
Finally, the ball fell over the hope of Kepa Arrizabalaga and landed in the net.
"I was just trying to get into a position to get to the ball and players like Shaq always playing as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and didn't think so much about it, but just fired."
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half of the game after a goal in the 25th minute from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker lifted a passport back to Mateo Kovacic, spinned off near the middle field and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the middle field.
Then he got a superior kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defence and got the ball in the net at the outside chairpen with a left-footed kick along Liverpools Alisson Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo, Naples, Italy at 3:00 a.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea opposes Videoton in Uefa Europe League in London at 15:00 a.m. on Thursday.
Death number for tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death rate for earthquake and tsunamine in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early in Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the ruins of buildings that fell in the earthquake of 7.5, which hit on Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, said the Agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380 000 inhabitants, was filled with fires from buildings that raided.
The police are arrested, 32, suspected of murder after a woman's death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have prayed to people in the area who saw or heard something to appear.
Criminal Sergeant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in a early stage of the investigation, but I ask everyone near John Street in Birkenhead and see or hear something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A spokesman for the police has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found in a property.
During the afternoon, friends who think that they know the woman arrived to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and the police shall inform the victim's nearest relative.

Parliament's statue of Cromwell latest victims of disputes on the rewrite of history
A ban light would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatic puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal for "throughness" and "try to write about history."
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was unavoidable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate on removing statues."
The iconoclasm during the English civil war was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Maybe Fel Cromwell would be sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas did 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the history of a man who many believe still should be commended.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a proper representation, there is an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person representing one side of the matter.
His operations as Lord Protector also deserve to be commended and celebrated.
Mörder Gris kills farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, which is only identified with his surname Yuan, was found dead with a brown artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, reported South China Morning Post in Sundays.
A pig breeder is ready to inject vaccines in pigs in a swine strap on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his cousin from the Yunnan neighbouring province in Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a pig in the vicinity was open.
He said there was a big grishane in the pigsty with blood on his mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that the 250 pounds of heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and distorted," said the cousin identified with the surname Wu to Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The girl who killed the farmer wasn't Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the site.
Yuan's family and the market responsible are reported for negotiations on compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and gave the man serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 pounds pressed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can work as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
The rest of the orkan Rosa for extensively heavy rain to the southwest USA
As predicted, the orkan Rosa becomes weaker when it travels over cooler waters on the north coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and southwest the United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind force of up to 135 km/h, category 1, five EST in Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form over the Pacific and travel eastwards to the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California half island as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture interacting with the nearest toughness will create extensively strong rain in the southwest USA in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm rain will cause dangerous flooding, leather flows and possibly strawberries in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm rain per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5–10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the southwest USA, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly worsening conditions due to the spreading tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone go out in the desert to foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can make canyons to swiming rivers and eagle storms lead to strong local winds that blow around sand.
The nearest trath brings somewhat locally strong rain to parts of the southern coastline of California.
It is possible with a total of over one cm of rain, which can lead to leather flows and hail roads.
That would be the first rain in the area during the raining period.
Some tropical rains will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will be spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue during Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes in short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
There is almost ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern USA are expected to get a warm start on October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of the Northeast United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a great chance for warmer temperatures than the average in Eastern America during the first half of October.
More than 20 million looked at Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million looked at Thursday's arrogant testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual attacks that should have taken place in the 1980s, at six TV networks.
In the meantime, the political death situation continued, and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday's last minute twist – Arizona's senator Jeff Flake's agreement with the FBI where they were given a week to investigate the accusation.
Ford told Senate Judiciary Committee that she's absolutely sure that Kavanaugh's taffled her when he was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said he's absolutely sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers in Friday was higher than the 20.4 million specified by the Nielsen.
They counted average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has problems counting people who look from office.
Comparedly, there are as many viewers as for a football match in the end game or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown a strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, most viewers had an average of 5.69 million during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
The ABC was the next with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was focused on Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed demonstrators who screamed at him when he tried to take an elevator to a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators screamed at him, as was shown in the direct transmission of CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and before the lift doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the Committee.
The TV networks sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on if they would continue Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the whole senate.
But Flake said he was just going to do it if the FBI would investigate the accusations against the nominated in the next week, on which minority Democrats have appealed.
Flake was partially convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision had a great impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched a FBI investigation on the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political games" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about the future of the UK and to undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called "Chequers plan for Brexit" and said that the proposal to collect each other's customs duties was "completely unreasonable".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrests suspected Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
The police have arrested a suspect of the death shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and arrested for murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses in the battle.
The police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to the CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After interrogation with Simpson, the police said he admitted that he killed Wayde.
His guarantee was fixed to $350,000, according to Advocate.
The court doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a gun in the head and in the neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police's escape operation force, the police's state legal slave, Southern University's police and inhabitants in the area for helping the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "fleet and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 metres long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played the basket for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basket trainer Will Wade said that the team was "cracked" and "chocolate" of Wayde's death.
"You're worried about these things all the time," said Wade.
The volcano sprays ashes over Mexico City
Aska from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
National Center for Disaster Prevention in Saturday Mexicans warned to stay away from the volcano after activity was discovered in the crater and the registered 183 emissions of gas and ashes during the course of 24 hours.
The centre discovered several mules and shells.
Pictures on social media showed thin stocks of ashes on wind squares in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have noted increased activity in the volcano, which stands 72 km south of the capital since an earthquake of 7.1 affected central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police meets with Catalan separatists before the day of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence demonstrations were assembled with credentials at the same time as thousands of people participated in rivalizing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists who were held back by prallpolis thrown eggs and colour powder on them, resulting in dark dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Slags also broke out later during the day, and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups called "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists called "long living Spain".
14 people were treated for minor damage caused by the protests, according to local press.
The meeting is still excited in the region that longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October which was considered illegal by Madrid but was commended by Catalan separatists.
A overwhelming majority voted for independence, but the participation was low when most of those who were opposed to the secession bowled the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent collapses last year when the police tried to stop the vote at electoral stations in the region.
Independence groups camped in the evening on Friday to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
Electricist Narcis Termes, 68, participated in the separatist protest with his wife and said that he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
"Tonight, we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy to be able to vote, but now we've been trapped," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal profit in regional elections in December, Catalan parties who are for independence have had difficulty maintaining the driving force this year, when many of their most well-known leaders live in self-detained exiles or are in jail in the waiting for trial on their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old engineer who recorded the protest to support the police on their mobile phone, said that the conflict had been celebrated by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more excited," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been arrested since the end of last year, announced that he is going to be able to vote for the European Parliament next year.
"The best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the undercover we have experienced from the Spanish government is to get to the European Parliament," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving into house
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incidence took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST in Thursday.
Criminal Sergeant Bob Blemmings said that the gates and the building themselves were damaged.
A bracelet can also have been fired against the car.

Livingston shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengas strike proved to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was divided two with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side has still not gained away in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers Rapid Vienna in Europe League welcomes Thursday.
Livingston extends its profit range to six matches – the main trainer Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against two visitors
Holt's law should have taken the lead far before they made goals; their justice gave Rangers all possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but drew his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could just shoot wide after glideing in to measure Craig Halkett's nicking across the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them when they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that was how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a free park and Livingston used an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to give Menga a chance, which made goals from the middle of the target area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was uncontinuous and the target guard Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half of the game, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers target guard Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston's target area and were handled without problems. Two penalties – after Halkett's challenge by Glenn Middleton and one for hand – were dismissed.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotlands Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal show and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed the expectations on the way upwards.
Their game style and staff have hardly changed since they returned to the upper level, but Holt deserves the honor to have galvanized the team since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defence, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall straight through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their hours under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball did not hold the measure – they opened only the home page once – and it is one of a wake watch for Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday offered smile and blue sky (29 September) when Turkey's and Germany's leaders at breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – which will repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They have become disastrous about human rights, freedom of pressure and Turkey's entry into the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many followers were gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrations – many of them Kurdish – also heard their votes and condemned both Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome him to Germany.
The dual protests show the divided views of a visitor who is considered a hero of certain German Turks and is condemned as an enforcer by others.
Road luck in Deptford: Cyclist dies in crack with car
A cyclist died in a crack with a car in London.
The Krock took place near the crossing of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a well-bemanded road in Deptford in southeast London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurses were called there, but the man died in the place.
The crock takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an infection accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crack at Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they were trying to identify the man and to inform his nearest relatives.
Roads have been locked off and buses have been redirected and car drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Sex guards hurt in tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in an emergency in a high security prison for men, according to the Prison Office.
The horrors broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST in Sundays and continues.
Specialized "tornoffs" have been called there to deal with the anxiety, which involves eight prisoners on a flyer.
The guards were treated in place for smaller injuries in the face.
A spokesman for Prison Service said: "Sspecially trained prison staff have been sent there to deal with the current incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those behind this will be assigned to the police and can get extended prison penalty."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals of the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was treated in hospitals after an attack by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the criminal police were called to the prison to deal with serious distresses where staff were attacked with biljard balls.
The Orkan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week when the orkan Rosa’s remaining energy pulls out over the desert in the southwest USA, with a risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and in the south and east of Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix in a twot said that only "Tree tropical cycles have maintained status as tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was an orchestra within 65 km from Arizona's border."
National Hurricane Center's latest models prevail 5–10 cm rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwest USA, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to have 2.5 to 5 cm rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden floods, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, since the region is affected by dryness.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rains will probably benefit because the Southwest USA suffers from drying.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, soon over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme dry, the second highest category, reported Weather.com.
The Oracle Rosa will first travel over the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with an orkan force in Sunday morning with a maximum wind force of 135 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north for 20 km/h.
The storm blows on cooler waters in the Pacific, which calms it down.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico’s country mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get strong rain, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 7.5–15 cm rain is expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm," reported Weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north over Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona's border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very strong rain in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the wilderness in the southwest USA," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life - threatening floods and leather flows in the desert, as well as earth scraps in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for murder attempts
Three teenager boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested suspected for murder attempts after a 16-year-old found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The teenager boy was found damaged in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST at Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable."
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man was arrested in the area of Radstock during the night, said the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police ask everyone who may have filmed what happened to the phone to come forward.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "lead, evilness, irritation" from the democratic party
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the disobedience and scandalous tactics of the democratic party," said Trump to its followers in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "lided of the evilness, anger" from the democratic party during the entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Convention on Thursday and denied strongly and emotionally Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he was sexually committed to her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed his accusation before the Congress.
The president said this Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and quality and courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most skillful legal senses of our times, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he said to his followers in the audience of West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of the vote of the Republicans in the coming midterm elections.
"We are five weeks from one of our most important choices.
I don't candy, but I candidate," he said.
"That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to "resist and stop".
The first decisive vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to the CNN from a assistant to a senior republikan leader.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number of rises
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when gigantic waves crashed against the beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island Sulawesi, according to the authorities of Saturday.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a festival on the beach of Palu in Friday when up to six metres high waves crashed against the beach in the sky and swept out many to a safe death and destroyed everything in their way.
Tsunamin came after a 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stayed on the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victims of tsunamin," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian disaster agency GDPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tunamin was not alone but dragged with cars, stocks and houses. It hit everything in its way," said Nugroho. He also said that tsunamin had traveled on open sea for up to 800 km/h before it hit the coastline.
Some climbed up in trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
The flight photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
Afternoons still hit the coastal town at Saturday.
The range of earthquakes was felt in a population of 2.4 million.
In a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake in Friday was 200 times as large as the nuclear bomb released at Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is at the end of a long, narrow bowl, which may have made tsunamin bigger, according to the Agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "inclusive" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims found during the ship of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were damaged and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and damages can be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, a area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Donggala's communication "was completely paralyzed without any information," said Nugroho.
"It lives over 300 000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse," they said.
The Agency was criticized at Saturday for not informed that tsunamin had hit against Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time of warning.
In a amateur video divided on social media, a man on the upper floor in a building is heard crying frenetic warnings about tsunami to people on the street below.
In a few minutes a wall of water crashes against the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't authenticate the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamine led to an extensive power breakdown that interrupted all communication around Palu, which weakened the rescue work for the authorities.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send there a freight flight from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated persons are still in a great need for food and other supplies.
The city airport has been opened for assistance and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of dead in tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Collaborators from World Vision in Donggala have taken to Palu where they seek protection during presences on the farm outside the office, but they saw destruction along the road, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many ruined houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Assistance groups have started the bitter assistance work, but some complained that foreign assistance workers with extensive expertise were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and employees from abroad may only be used if exceptional authorisations are declared after a disaster.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a speaker of the Indian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say that it is a national disaster, we can release international assistance, but that status has not been explained yet."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake, and tsunami hoped relatives and friends of missing people still hoped that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that light up dark natural disasters.
Saterday a little boy was saved from a cloak.
During Sunday, the rescue workers saved a woman who had been stuck under fire for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the national screen flight trainer of Indonesia, had trained two of the missing screen flights before Asian games, which ended in Indonesia earlier in the month.
Others who were firm at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As the screen flight veteran, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that the hours after hearing that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed he sent desperately WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who attended the beach festival.
But his messages only received a grey bow, instead of two blue.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.

Kanye West: The Ripper changes names to Ye
The Ripper Kanye West is changing names – to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter this Saturday and said, "The being which is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of its eighth album, released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the programme, which put in the programme for "sensitive reasons" according to the program's creator.
Ye is a abbreviation of West's current professional names, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'yu'," said West earlier this year when he spoke of the title of his album with radio values Big Boy.
"So I am you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye – a mirror of our good, our wicked, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of those we are."
He's one of a number of well-known rapers who've changed names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously cooperated with West, has previously written its name with and without binding lines and letters.
Mexico's AMLO swear not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's recently elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to never use the military against civilians now when the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody remuneration against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "never used the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Trupper fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 600 people during an era when left-directed student movements hit root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate training opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double AI financing
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and the AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment will be made after several parts of the US government have made statements on AI, although the United States does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the aim of becoming leader in AI-innovation before 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough within AI," said Lee.
A double as large budget can double the chance that the next big AI breakthrough is made in the United States, said Lee to CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published earlier in the month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO for Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI company – Face++.
At the Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that hit the highest ranking American Othello player, and later he sat in the leadership of Microsoft Research and was the CEO of Google’s China department.
Lee mentioned previous technology competitions from the US government, as Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what the next would be to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get appropriations from the government, said Lee.
"It is not China who takes the academic leaders from us, but business," said Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from universities to work at AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the United States with the AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors within AI," he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation grants funds to people at academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other authorities organisations share money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, said Lee.
Previously this year the United States Defense Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the creation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonia's referendum on the change of names
The Macedonian population voted in Sundays in a referendum on if the name of the country was to be changed to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would solve a decades-old dispute with Greece which has prevented the country's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its neighbour in the north is a requirement in its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change of name would undermine the identity of the slave majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he is not going to vote in the referendum and a bojkot campaign has led to doubts if the minimum participation of 50 per cent required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The question of the false part of the referendum is: "Are you for membership of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the successors of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that it is worth replacing the name if it makes Macedonia, one of the countries which were formed when Yugoslavia was split, can join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for youths in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the paraply of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of this House have said that they are going to follow the outcome in order to consider it decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
According to the State election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 8:00 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the latest elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered votes voted.
"I vote for the sake of my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum in Macedonia on the exchange of names, which would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union in Srumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
Apart from Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organised a small scene and place chairs in front of the tents set up by those who bojcott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we want to join the head in the air, not swallow through the back door," said Kavardarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership in NATO would lead to well-necessary investments in Macedonia, with a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the absolute majority will vote yes, because more than 80% of our inhabitants are for the European Union and NATO," said Zaev when he voted.
He said a "Yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by Macedonia’s Political Surveillance Institute, between 30 and 43% of the voters in the referendum, which falls under the necessary minimum participation.
According to another study carried out by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of the participants thought of vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them thought to vote yes.
In order to count the referendum, 50% of the registered votes must be plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious backbone of the Westernly focused government policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester Citys Sergio Aguero goes through the entire Brighton Defense to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling hit Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 wins at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England in Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he made goals for the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a passport from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out in the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He took around a defender and ran from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a passport to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used its first shot in the target area to return the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to strike Brighton's target guard Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," said City's manager Pep Guardiola to the journalists.
"We talked about playing for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he made goals at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial acquisition in the Premier League game.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into the Brighton revir on that game.
He sent a nice shot along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the other chair.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball in the net just before it got out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the group game in Champions League at Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the end game, so there was no reason to force one to start.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only about Rockies, which is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance for the final game.
Rockies got a wild card site with a profit of 5-2 over Nationals on Friday night, but still looking for their first division title.
"We don't play about anything, but we can get a chance to quit the rubber in knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at a higher level than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not announced their beginning for Sunday yet, but according to reports they reluctant to let Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullet in Thursday and would throw on its normal weekly Sunday.
Washington's right-handed casters are 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 inches this season.
Trump holds numbers in West Virginia
The President pointed indirectly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, which is nominated to the High Court of Justice, when he spoke about the importance of the vote of the Republicans in the coming midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks from one of our most important choices.
This is one of the big, big... I don't know, but I candiider. That's why I'm going around and fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happen here and now.
They are determined to take power back whatever is required, you see their wickedness, terror.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We shall not let them get it."
Democrats, he said, struggle to "resist and stop".
"You've seen that in the last four days," he said, and he called the Democrats "arge and evil and terrible and false."
He mentioned the democratic senator Dianne Feinstein, who is sitting in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was embraced by high-bowing from the audiences.
"Do you remember what she said?
'You lost the document?'
"Eh, eh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for a ...' It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I've seen."
Labour is no longer a wide church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censure me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of MPs from Labour who will hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she stood against antisemitism.
In my case, I was criticized not to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of a responsible economic policy, about the security of the nation, about Europe – ironically enough, similar to issues that Jeremy criticized earlier leaders.
The communication on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be welcomed and productive".
During most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been exactly that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not that, and the promise of "friendlyer, every more" policies has been forgotten long ago, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated within Labour, and each opinion is judged on the basis of the party leaders accepting it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I previously thought had a similar political view that I expected to make a whole reverse and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed on – whether it was the nation's security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it really doesn't matter what I say – follow a tire of unconsciousness on social media that demands that I be released, criticized the middle policy and says that I shouldn't even be involved in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more lucky than some of my colleagues because most of the comments that are addressed to me are political.
I admire the professionality and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist inappropriations every day but never give up.
One of the greatest disappointments in this policy of yours is the level of intimidation that is now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality, we are no longer this wide church, and with every mistrust and change in the selection rules, the party becomes all the closer.
I have received many advice in the last two years to fly under the radar and not be too straightforward, so it's "recorded".
But that's not why I became politician.
Since I joined in Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by Thatcher's government's neglect as literally led my basic school classroom to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need most – both at local level and as minister of government.
I have never hidden my political opinions, which includes the latest elections.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused with my opinions on policies and issues in which I do not agree with the current leadership.
To you who promoted the call for Friday, I would just like to say that when the country goes against a Brexit that will harm households, activities and public services, I do not understand why someone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's party leader.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my election circle – both Labour and others: I am proud of serving you and I promise that no threat to dispose of me or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Odd Ayr on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
They're now on the top, the only unseen side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defence, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home team the profit, and the trainer Peter Murchie has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our matches so far and are still unsuccessful, so we are so obviously happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayer deserves it, they took better chances than we."
Grant Anderson's attempts in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scotland Captain Rory Hughes, released by Warriors for the match, Melrose let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's leadership with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start on the second half game and Patrick Anderson's attempts, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It was then a long waiting for a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried by the plan, and after the restart, Ayr increased the management again with a attempt from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr’s acting captain Blair MacPherson then received a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of heavy pressure.
But the home team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have tackled Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the criminal line out behind Ayr's monkey.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's box kick and sent away the flank Gregor Henry for the flank for the fifth attempt of the home team.

Still Game Star Ford Kiernan seems ready to enter the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been specified as the CEO for a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays in with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duon has announced that the next nineth season will be the last of the series, and Kiernan seems to be planning for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The shade player refused to comment, but a source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to enter Glasgow's "blomish restaurant business".
"The Sea belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes that the Court reopens the way to the Pacific
Seemen patrol a richly covered headquarters for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
Bass of the fleet from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazons bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In the coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that was lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong – and it is also the desire to sail again on the Pacific Sea.
This hope is higher than in several decades now that Bolivia is waiting for a decision from the International Court of Justice on first October, after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a atmosphere of unity and peace, and so clearly expects the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court on large screens over the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will judge for the benefit of Bolivia's claim that after years of irregular discussion, Chile must negotiate with Bolivia to allow them for their own exit to the sea.
The decision of the Monday also has great importance for Evo Morales, Bolivia’s Carismatic Inborn President, who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is incredible that the Court judges Bolivia's advantage and that it would not change much even if it did.
The UN Court, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to award a Chilean territory and has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been captured by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
She claims that Morale's aggressive retoric has hurt Chile's remaining welfare.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do it after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the representative of Bolivia in the Hague, did not think that the Court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
The Monday will give Bolivia "a outstanding opportunity to start a new era for the relationship with Chile" and an opportunity to "set a stop for 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the question of the sea as a political crown.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to have access to the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is an opportunity to realize that we have to go on from the past."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament requires confidence in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that the nation will not disarm their nuclear weapons until they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made during a Singapore Summit between the two rivalizing leaders.
His comments came when the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seemed to be on the border to solve the death situation for nuclear diplomats more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is a "throom" to continue sanctions and the US protests against a statement of termination of the Korea war will ever take place in North Korea.
Washington hesitates to accept the statement without Pyongyang’s first launching significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump want an additional summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against the fact that Pyongyang is really going to get rid of a weapon arsenal that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion views reveal the latest line huge main bonuses on the way to shops near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a variety of crazy, over-dimensional headbonads for their SS19 collection at the catwalk, which blending the style icons at the Paris fashion week.
Incredibly opraktic hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent away their ignorant creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s chief creation was an excessive beige hat with a featherlike broad hatboard that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other over-dimensional accessors included jewelry-prayed water melons, a magic hat and even an ananas – but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips together and rather like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like a wet garment with snorkel and diving mask, and another looked like a melted glass straw.
And if you continue the huge courage, you're lucky.
Mode experts predict that the huge hives can be on the way to shops close to you.
The over-dimensional hats come right after La Bomba – the straw hat with a 60 cm breeze seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark that was behind the incredible opraktic hat that has overtaken social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as large as the model in the bathing suitcase that held in it.
The raffia bag in terracotta, with raffia francs and a white leather handle, excellent in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris fashion week.
The artist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I am waiting to see big hats and beach bags in the shops next summer – the designer has had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for over-dimensional accessors."
John Edward: Language skills decisive for global citizens
Independence schools in Scotland maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, which are only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sports, art, music and other communities.
With up to 30 000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service for their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement adapted teaching plans, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and demanded topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot only rely on English when we create relations and trust with people from other countries.
The results of this year show that languages are at the top of the list, with a maximum number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the Higher Grade final sample.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of the students who studied mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as decisive skills such as children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages such as topic selection are now considered to be as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics at educational plans in independent schools and beyond.
A study conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that employers had difficulty in fulling their vacancies, with 17% claimed a lack of language skills.
In this way, language skills become more and more necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs that require language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the choice of career, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have embraced a second language.
To be able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a study of more than 4,000 adult brites published by YouGov 2013, 75 per cent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that totally came up in a two-digit percentage (15 per cent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
To speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance to find a meaningful job in the future.
In Scotland every school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach in languages that are considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose between in-house schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scotland's independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and get them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future is.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly the language that continues to be decisive for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication ability".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people in Scotland.
Il runs bien le faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakersdebut on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is almost over to fans who look forward to seeing LeBron James make debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first season match of Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official website of Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for Lakers' seasonal schedule.
"I don't need foreseeable games in this stage of my career to be ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump takes his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five planned events next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In the wake of a confirmative vote of its candidate to the High Court's vacant post, Trump aims to build up support for future mid-year elections, as the Republicans risk losing control over the Congress before the current election in November.
What time is Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign event is planned to 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can look at Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with this week's hearing by the candidate to the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was tended to be accused of his sexual abuse, with a expected delay in the vote from the Senate up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is underway.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans to get some meat on the legs before the November election.
Thus, President Trump said that these five conventions next week aimed at "incorporating volunteers and adherents when the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority of the Senate and the Reuters House", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign that would not be named Reuters.
The night's event, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate Candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has tailored in the opinions surveys.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come there to try to give him an increase in the opinions surveys," says Simon Haeder, a state scientist at the West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA struggles to keep the hopes alive in front of Sunday singles
After three unilateral sessions, the pair competitions in Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The moment's swinging pendel is a completely invented sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before competitions like these.
So what moment is it about now?
"They had a six-point management and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has, of course, four points of advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have a little wind in the sail, but they have much to be encouraged by, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tea to the green and precedes with good example.
The trumpet of wine scaled more than higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive put to take the match four all-square when he and Thomas had been after with two after two games.
His put that won them the match of 15 met with a similar wral, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deeply and worry about your own match," said Spieth.
That's all that all these players have now.
18 holes for victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's indisputable story.
Europe's odd but delicious couples are four out of four and now nothing can be wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not make a bookey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bookeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and the public's reactions determine that they are the players to beat on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time on different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the fireball hero in the morning, together with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles on front nine lowered the Spanish and Swedish in a hole that they never even came near to get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one helps you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursome are so fascinating to look closely because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a law so far and took a significant leadership before the last day, but this four-seven session also showed that the United States team had a struggle that some, especially on the side of the United States, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cup's last day after having come out from Saturday's four-hour ball and foursomes matched with a 10-6-direction over the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a camped Tiger Woods and came home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, which struggled to keep the pocal that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American law that never really started during the morning's fireball with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two matches, but it wasn't enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's law needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single matches to keep the pocal.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in row while he and Molinari, baptized to "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, is only the second couple to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fireball, they hit a exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more suppressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who struck through two matches on Saturday, showed tests for some moments of brilliant, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fireball and foursome, and seven of them in row.
Justin Rose, rested in the morning's fireball and returned to the partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe didn't have the wind all the way, but it was a nice, blue day right southwest of Paris.
Three-fold winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home with 2 & 1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fireball and returned later to hit Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history a team has come back from a base of four points in the single matches, however Furyk's side needs only an unfinished result to keep the pocal.
After having been the second best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says that the "never" will be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their mistrust with the United States and it was not possible that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "essential measures to show its welwilling" in the last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling installations for nuclear tests and promiseing not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technologies.
"We do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Besides any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there will be no chance of unilaterally disarming ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a approach divided into stages of nuclear power that would lead to the reward of North Korea when it took gradual steps, his statement seemed important, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution completely as Pyongyang did before.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting American president and a North Korean leader in Singapore 12 June, where Kim promised to work against "developing nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end of the Korea war 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected negotiations on facilitating harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"USA insists on "development first" and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose by force and even objects to the "Declaration of Finishing the War", says Ri.
"The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a dream for those who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans at a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leaders highlighted in the United Nations earlier during the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months, adding: "If the party in this matter had been South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a death situation."
Nevertheless, the tone in Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the future ability of North Korea to reach the United States' continent with raketes was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "raketman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "voluntarily destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but it said that much work still remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeframe for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, the US State Secretary Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without fail until we realize complete, final, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to violate the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made. However, North Korea accused him a few hours later of the "gathering-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile plant and also a nuclear crawl complex for the United States to take "equivalent measures".
He said that Kim had told him that the "equivalent measures" he was looking for were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and moved against normalisation of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all doctors to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "dygs".
A academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often disgusting about the grounds for how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers is the first in his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep shortage on learning.
"In the end of it a girl came up to me and said, "Why can't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said no one had ever told her about the weight of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the University Health Services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that the students suffered from severe sleep shortage during the week.
The hour-long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In a part of the course there is a picture of a student room where students click on coffee cups, gardins, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how atletic performance is affected by sleep shortages and the weight of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants will learn how long-term sleep shortage can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of the students directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The pride culture of "dying" still exists, he says and added that modern technology and constantly increasing pressure on students meant that sleep shortage was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "safe weapon" to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight rising because sleeplessness puts the brain in hunger and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California studying chemical and physical biology, did Professor Czeisler help to design the course and have read one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctors to complete a similar study programme before they start their studies at the high-performance institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider setting an alarm for when to sleep and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn on the day, leading to sleeping problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengas goals lower Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Mengas strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 downfall in Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking to get home his first victory on the road since February's 4-1 triumph on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as manager to leave his team eight points after the Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Menga hit seven minutes before half time, and Rangers never managed to smooth out the result.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on target difference.
And there may be more problems on the side of Rangers after the lineman Calum Spence had to treat for a main wound after a object was thrown from the outside end.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semifinal in Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 that took a point of Heart's last week and he would have been happy about the way his well-saved game overlooked the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes in the game when Mengas first pass released Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middle officer missed his great chance and shot out.
A free park on the depth of Keaghan Jacobs then reached the law captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow just reached the back chair.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their games during the last third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo felt sure he should have been punished when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson fled away the colombian's call.
Rangers only managed to do two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly easily received Lassana Coulibaly's neck and a tall shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Life's opening shots in the 34th minute may go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their servant deserved it.
Again, Rangers failed to handle Jacob's firm situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fitted Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the byte gave almost immediate effect when the ytter hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to make the opponents play exactly the type of games they like, with Lithgow and Halkett that swept up long passing after long passing.
Holt's side could have strengthened his lead in the last stage, but McGregor did well to prevent Jacobs before Lithgow knocked out after the corner.
The Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for punishment when he was tempted with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanacka: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, a invention that eventually led to the manic called Geiger meter.
Geigermeters have since become a foundation for science and are also large in pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the main role of the seemingly unlikely cowpoke researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
"What in all the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these horns, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that are given by the radioactivity of the minerals. "Evans:
Evans, "Yes, it pops now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63 anniversary.
But the invention that wears his name is still alive.
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can learn the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method means extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then "see" a protein that is common for many cancer forms and then reinjected
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different forms of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who learns the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovary cancer cells disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common for many cancer forms called HER2, and then reinject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast-, ovary, lung and thickarm cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and learning them how to address cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after its SNL performance.
It wasn't that good.
Kanye West was buried out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a swiming appearance in which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump and said he himself would candidate for post 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he had a Make America Great-skips, he ran against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times when I talk to a white person, they say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Star was fooling Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Legal Committee on the accusations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the playback of West's exhibition was loaded up on social media by the competitor Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to drive with West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been insulted backstairs for his head.
"They kicked me backstairs.
They said, "Don't go out with that bitch on."
They kicked me!
And then they say I fell low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Would you also sink low?" and said that he would "set my supermancape on, because that means you can't say what I can do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
Test with love."
His comments attracted more burop at least twice from the audience and employees from the SNL seemed to be embarrassed, reported Variety. One person said, "It was deadly in the studio."
West had come in as a later substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rappar Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West confounded many with its appearance of the song I Love it, dressed to a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the Conservative Group of TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous souls: TACK FOR TO THAT THAT THAT THAT MOT MOBBEN."
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was himself and it's completely wonderful."
"But I chose to NOT reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "kunst") that I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We're with, added she.
Before the show, the rappar on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said he was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Rappar College, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and of course the deceased music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Domes for murder attempts after knife cutting in the restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempts to kill after a man was knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The event occurred in Ballyhackamore, said the police.
The defendant is expected to find himself at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The accusations will be examined by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington struggles against toxic maskulinity
Kit Harington is known for its sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has expressed himself negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo eran.
Kit, who recently married his actress in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also she 31, acknowledged that he feels "fairly strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel quite strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV may partly be responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is born and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and on the streets, making young boys feel that they must be in a certain way to be a man?
I think that is really one of the major issues today - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also acknowledged that he wouldn't do any Game of Thrones followers when the series arrives at the end of the next summer and says he's "clear with battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The shooter recently revealed that he thinks the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so it gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, which Kits character Jon Snow loves in, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family ownership in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced an increase of 14 % of the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people have been affected in the country, says the healthcare authorities.
About 40 000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly distributed through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected by HIV had decreased to nearly zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100 000 people from year to year.
HIV-smith through collection is an urgent issue in China's HBT municipality.
Homosexuality was discriminated in China in 1997, but discrimination of HBT people is said to be widespread.
Due to its conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men before or later will marry women.
Many of the infectious cases are due to inadequate protection in assemblies in these relations.
Since 2003, China's government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of the efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses that staff lacquered the GOP senator's tasks, swept on "threatening lies" and "conspiration theorys"
On Saturday, the American Congress Member Maxine Waters condemned the claim that one of her employees had put personal data on three republikan American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that these claims were distributed by right-extremist websites.
"Lyes, lies and more rejectable lies," said Waters in a statement on Twitter.
The released information contained home addresses and telephone numbers to Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during the hearing of a senat panel on the accusations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The bag came once after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters Office and released the information on a member of Waters staff, reported Hill.
"This unreasoned claim is totally false and a absolute lie," Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been threatened as a result of these fraudulent and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unreasoned claim is totally false and a absolute lie."
Water's statement was rapidly criticized online, including from the former press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they must not be angry.
They shouldn't be detestable.
They must not question the motives of the questionnaire.
They must be calm and sensible."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of being angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was able to place Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"But if true," he twisted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and criminal agents for these fraudulent requirements.
"We will ensure that the acters will be revealed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review of Johnny English Strikes Again - Powerless spy parodi by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to search for Brexit services in each new film with British lulling, and the same seems to apply to this new recording of the latest Johnny English actioncomedin - a series of spy parodies that were fired in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will fast satir know how obviously bad we are to become the nation's new export product?
In any case, it has the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber view got its license to customer to business renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide comic creation intended for biopublic even in non-English-speaking countries
Of course, he is the crushing secret agent, who, despite his bizarre claims on smoothieglamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a gnutta Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from opening ceremony to the OS in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two good moments in the latest JE film
I loved when Johnny English approaches a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor leaves hit his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but the humor feels quite low and strangely excessive, especially because the "serious" film brands like 007 and the Mission Impossible itself now offers comedi as an ingredient.
The humor feels as if it's customized for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English's weird appearances are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's stumfilm's father in the role as Bean.
The constantly current issue is now that the UK is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super-secret web network of spies, which reveals the identity of all UK agents outside the field, to the agent in the great displeasure of service - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last throat of a Prime Minister who is a pumpous and hard employed figure, who is already suffering from a complete collapse of its political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing its best with this quasi-Teresa-May caractor but the manus does not offer much to work with.
Her notification adviser informs her that when each single active spy is busy, she must use someone in pension.
And that means the staging Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in any well-bearing institution, but who offers unofficial lessons in the art to work undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former long-living side kick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine, a jolly-hockey-sticks roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to being thrown away.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terrible wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and hit Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the carismatic tech billionaire, who claims that he can solve the UK computer break: the unhappy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssé of farsarte uptakes: dressed to sergeants, they put fire on a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they smuggle onto Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he trys to use a VR headset to acquaint themselves with the inside of Volta's house.
It certainly lies a lot of jobs behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and speedy, it has a air of child TV around itself.
Very moderately everything like everything.
And like with the other Johnny English movies, I can't keep thinking: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies that a plan is designed for the British to work a four-day week but a few pay for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Party Labour considers a radical plan that is going on the British working a four-day week - but get paid for five.
The party, according to the statement, wishes to give business leaders savings made through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra vacation day.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend, but keep the same salary.
According to sources, the idea of "passing" with the party's economic agenda would be in favour of workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trade unions Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic changes.
A representative higher in the Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day week of work is an effort that suits the party's attitude to balance the economy in favour of the workers and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the Greens party who promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017.
However, this objective is not recorded by Labour as a whole.
A spokesman for Labour said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and there's nothing that the party agrees on."
Shadow Chancell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from "ansightless leader" and "snippler" on state companies.
The shadow channeller's plans also mean that the current shareholders of aquatic companies cannot get back their entire effort, as a Labour Government can make "deductions" due to what they think was wrong actions.
He also confirmed plans to set workers in business administrations and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10% of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, which then is going to receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell in the TV program "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their opinions
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court of Justice by at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could have some Republican senators to change their position in the matter.
In an interview sent on Sundays, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would lead to their change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I entered the hearing, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, indispensable."
However, Graham's voice seems inevitable.
"I've already decided about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamism tank," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brot denied it strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I can't see anything new change."
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will be hosted by Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has an impressive appearance of stars that appear and a similarly impressive mission; fighting world poverty.
Now during its seventh year, Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people voyaged to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goals of the event: fighting extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Festival, according to a 2012 statement, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocate group hoping to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would carry out a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteer work, mailing a world leader, calling or in other meaningful ways contribute to increasing awareness of the objective of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it only about so-called "clictivism" - people who feel that they make real difference by signing an online application or writing a twot?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "handlings" have been registered from its followers who have struggled for a variety of goals.
It says that these measures have contributed to calling world leaders to announce commitments and policies that correspond to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect life for more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the collected assets have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the UK between investors and actors who are involved in "helping children to develop their full potential", promised to give Rwanda $35 million to contribute to combating underernity in the area after getting more than 4,700 twots from global citizens.
"With the support of the British Government, donor, national governments and global citizens, just as you, we can do social injustice as undernæring is a footnote in history," said the ambassador of the partnership Tracey Ullman to the crowd under a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken which require the UK to improve the cost of mothers and children, the government announced financing of the project, Power of Nutrition, which covers diet programmes aimed at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on their website, "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Answered Global Citizens: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartment movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who appear at the event of the year in New York, whose hosts are Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicates the Home Minister
The government can “if necessary” attack its fleet to prevent Russian energy actors from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, has the U.S. Home Minister Ryan Zinke revealed, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - especially where it works on the invitation of the legitimate government - is a precursor to explore new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him there are ways and means to deal with it.
"USA has the ability to, with our fleet, ensure that seaways are kept open and, if necessary, apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group called "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they were really the same.
"The economic option to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuels," he said, as he referred to Russia as a "dayland" with a economy dependent on fossil fuels.
After the Trump administration has been aimed at increasing exports of its liquid natural gas to Europe, in order to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2-pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the "fånger of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington's resistance to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," said Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with the US energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was rejected by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, Federation of German Industries (BDI), has invited the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I regret that a third party disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Head of Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "good thinker" if she's going to set up in the presidential election 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would take a "good thought" about her participation in the presidential election after the middle-year elections of the United States.
During a Council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider setting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and it includes a woman on the top," said the Hill.
"After November 6, I'll take a real thinker to candider to the presidential post."
Warren weighed in to President Donald Trump during the Council meeting and said that "he took this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply worried about what Donald Trump does for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been liberal in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
In a twot on Friday Warren said, "We need a FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own advocates did not believe that she would be able to join 2020.
Fifty-fifth percent of the "faithful" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not be abledider, according to a study conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidate.
The study showed more support for a candidate of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for a potential candidate and 48 per cent against.
Other highly profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidate include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermonts Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking a yard in September.
He was arrested and accused of violence at home on Monday night
"What my own son goes through, what he's going through now when he's back, I can relate to other families who have experience in PTSD and some of the trauma with which our soldiers return," she said to the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest as "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they come back as other people, they come back hardly, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and flyers and all other members of the military, have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was accused of violence in the home of a woman, attempting to prevent a report on domestic violence and arms holding in a drunk state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, as well as Columbia District, support the question of a new asylum policy
Arton states and district of Columbia support a legal trial aimed at a new US policy that denies asylum to victims flying gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 States and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, reported NBC News.
Full name of the applicant in the case Grace v. Sessions submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been revealed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gentle sons," abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on July 20th.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries producing a large number of asylum seekers, as nations faced with major problems of gangs and violence in the home.
The new US asylum policy changed a decision of the immigration authorities from 2014 allowing illegal immigrants to seek asylum to escape from domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed based on specific facts and circumstances applicable to the claim, and such a provision is contrary to that principle," according to the friend-of-the court report.
Advocates further claimed in the report that the policy that denies the entry of immigrants is harmful to the US economy and argues that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "lever the necessary labour force".
Minister of Justice, Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered judges in asylum cases to no longer grant asylum to victims flying violence in home and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a certain social group or political opinion," said Sessions when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to remedy all problems - even all serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu when the death rate is doubled in the hunt of survivors
For the survivors, the situation seemed more and more dyster.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her fever boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance gets dead bodies all the time.
Pure water is a lack."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, rotating through water damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals hurt in the earthquake of 7.5 were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who were affected by a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the hospital Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to continued strong aftersales.
With tearful eyes he told me that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We don't escape.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think," told Haris to Associated Press and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then it became silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "mobbling" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-sided advertisement in an American newspaper on the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the American ambassador accused China that Peking used the American press to spread propaganda.
The US President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily paying a supplement in Des Moines Register - the State Iowas best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the sixth Congress election, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters where is a new phase in an escalating campaign from Washington intended to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Peking and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with high tariffs on each other's imports.
China's reimbursement rates early in the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states such as Iowa who support the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador in China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a great exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Peking had damaged American workers, farmers and companies.
China, wrote Branstad in a debate article in the Sunday’s Des Moines Register, "double the mob now by putting propaganda ads out in our own free press."
"The government of China uses America's dear tradition of freedom of speech and a free press to spread propaganda to by publishing paid advertisements in Des Moine's Register," wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the newspaper ski here in Beijing you will find a limited number of deviating votes and will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's anxious economy, as the media are controlled by the Chinese Communist Party with iron hand," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers nobbed the offer to publish" his article, even if he didn't say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female elections in front of the middle-year election through Kavanaugh fiaskot, warning analytics
Since many top republics defend the High Court's nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several accusations of sexual abuse, analyticals have warned that there will be a reversal, especially from women, during the coming elections.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they are in the elections.
It is not possible to turn the clock back, says Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s last attempt to a FBI investigation will be enough to calm up angry choices.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the demonstrating "November comes!" scanned when they demonstrated in the hall to the late building when the Republicans, who control the court committee, chose to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported Mic.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go to the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analytiker, for the news site.
"The people say it was already high, that's true.
But it could be higher, especially among the still undetermined female elections in the premises and younger elections, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Already before Ford's public testimony with accusations of sexual abuse against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a refusal could follow if the Republicans pressed through the confirmation.
"This has become a confused pipe for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote or final vote of the Committee, or if Kavanaugh comes through, it is also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But the Americans generally seem to be divided by who to believe in the Coldwater of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they most believe in.
A new opinion survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh probably lied or definitely under their testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims for Ford has made, as well as those of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford witnessed before the Senate’s Court Committee last week at the eed that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the applicant to the Supreme Court exposed his sex bodies to her while they participated in a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of World Wide Web, launches a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology theme is a company based on the Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who people are accessing the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world dominance".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historical moment."
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, make-lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique with the personal online data storage is that it is completely up to the user who can access which type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorization through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s Director John Bruce, is that the company should take resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some program developers to work with the project and a group of volunteers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt Web site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are at high edge over one night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee Internet transformed when he established World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an impressive voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic in front of this new era on the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest rewarded with Viktoria Cross during World War I
The only priest in the Church of England who was rewarded by a Victoria Cross during the first world war is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Vann received the mark of his action during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a pricing shooter four days later and never learned that he had been assigned the most prestigeful price of the British military.
A memorial stone was covered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "bright symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the price.
According to London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his batalion on September 29, 1918 over Canal de Saint-Quentin "with a very thick dimme and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
Later he rushed up to the shooting line and led with "great braveness" line forward before he alone finished the battle.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German pricing shooter on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble in front of."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "known himself very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "a real hero's courage is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to look at Bellator 206 and got instead to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've stopped all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 matches, including sex on the main card and was displayed live at night in Britain on channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program was suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were little impressed after they had stayed awake to the early morning hours to watch the match.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a signed child program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they were forced to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's Vice-President for marketing and communication when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Great pig, yes."
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they will work with their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution in terms of the reward," said Coker.
"But there is six in the morning on a Sunday there and we will not be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the program change was upset by many.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But in fact, it was a state question.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our head in our striving to satisfy the fans.
It's an unhappy situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "underlying" due to sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he felt underlying his companions during his growing up because of his sexuality - but it also encouraged him to be successful.
24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne he said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to give others "hop".
He also said that he was less concerned about winning the OS after getting a parent.
The regular program manager, Kirsty Young, of the popular show, has taken a few months to take free because of disease.
During his one-time performance at Laverne's first program, Daley tells him how he felt "less worth" than others during his growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He said, "This feeling of feeling less worthy of me and feeling me different has been a real source of power and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he did not deceive everyone when they finally found out his sexuality.
The two-fold Olympic Bridge Medal has become a high-profile advocate of HBT rights and exploited its appearance at the Commonwealth Games of Australia in order to convince more countries to discriminate homosexuality.
He said he said he spoke because he felt lucky to live openly without limitations and wanted to give others "hop".
The threefold world champion said that his love in a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - came as a surprise.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone in the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic Gold Medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son wears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of age after diagnosis with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad didn't accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was if they got their tickets to the Olympic Games in London 2012 - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't say to him, you won't be able to sit on the front line of Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was not until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at OS 2012 and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - dying in front of a home public on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to the OS and still gave him rushs.

Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will strike record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the form to avoid an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in row, was beaten by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the center of events, which he has often been to the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting heyachlack and training on his game in the hope of having a chance to show his ability.
He has never been the straightest of the drivers, not even on the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in the shape of the tough banana on Le Golf National, where the long rupee often is penalizing hardly.
It is not just the banana that scares, in the nineth match on Sunday, Mickelson champion Francesco Molinari, who together with the novis Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, which is 4 points below the 12 single matches have withwind at the beginning, Mickelson's match can be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a lap on my back and put his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," said Furyk.
"His self-confidence is nothing wrong with it.
He is a famous and he has added so much to these laws during previous seasons and the last week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he'd do more, but now it's what it is, and we'll be happy with it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday Mickelson Nick Faldo's record passes most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never lived completely up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halfs, but Furyk said that his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, chick, likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory only
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant leadership in the last day's singles in Ryder Cup can quickly change to an uncomfortable experience.
Dane made its debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballestero's leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but finally won with the least possible margin with the result 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"There is reminded of the great leadership of Valderrama, we led largely on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with need and nap," said Bjorn (on the photo) after having seen 2018's class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and leads with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll give everything.
Going out and doing everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the record.
Our goal is to try to win this pocal and that is where our focus is.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was satisfied with the performance of his players on a tough golf course and added: "I would never do this myself.
Tomorrow is waiting for new challenges.
Tomorrow it's the individual performances that apply, and it's a completely different thing.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it's good, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as a golf player is tested fully.
It is the message you need to communicate to the players, to get out the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also get out the best of himself."
Unlike Björn, the opponent Jim Furyk will want the players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of great turns during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe runs "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, Captain 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to go out as quickly as on Brookline, as on Medinah.
When the pace starts on one side, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediate matches.
We made our show and placed the guys we wanted to create, you know, some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the fight and meet Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter meet the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," said Bjorn about his single choice.
Germany's new warships are being postponed again
The latest fregat of the German fleet would have been sealed in 2014 to replace war vessels from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be sealed until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The operation of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship for the entire new Baden-Wuerttemberg freights, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to The Time newspaper quoting a military speaker.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems posed after delivery were extremely ambitious for the ambitious project.
The four ships in Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen freights.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of air-protective and sea-destination missiles, as well as certain smyg techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other key features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the latest freights for up to two years without contact with home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the ban-breaking war vessels - which allow Germany to project power abroad - are already aged when they are in operation, says Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 freight created headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
A little was known about the causes of retirement, but German media indicated a number of important "smuggle and machine goods" that made the warship worthless if it was used on a battle mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important because ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older freights in the Bremen class.
It also showed that the vessel has a significant overweight, leading to worsening performance and limiting the capacity of the marine to perform future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of "Rheinland-Pfalz" is assumed to be twice as heavy as similar vessels used by the Germans during World War II.
Besides incorrect hardware, the whole project's price note - including training of the crew - becomes a problem.
It is said to have been a fraudulent EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion dollars) compared to EUR 2.2 billion at the start stage.
Problems affecting the latest freights become particularly important in the light of the latest warnings that Germany's sea power is reducing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, admitted that the fleet "because it is going to be a shortage of fully equipped vessels".
The official said that it was a growing problem, because old ships are decommissioned but no substitute vessels were provided.
He regretted that none of the freights in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the marine.
National Trust thief lights to the secret life of the flattermouse
New research carried out on a property in the high-level countries in Scotland aims to reveal how fladdermus uses the landscape in its hunt for food.
We hope that the results will cast new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and contribute to controlling future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at National Trust for Scotland, will follow south and dwarf pistrell as well as brown borrowers and Daubenton flattermöss at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in important places around the property to track flattermus activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of fladder muscle sounds and the species that do what.
A life environment map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS natural care adviser, hopes that the results will reveal the areas of life environment that are most important for the fladdermöss and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will contribute to determining the benefits of life-environment management, such as the creation of widows, and the best way to maintain forest areas for fladdermouses and other related species.
Fladder Muscle Populations in Scotland and in the UK have decreased significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by building and development work affecting housing and loss of habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as airplanes and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks from hut taxes.
Fladdermus isn't really blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching the castle.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technology to find insects and obstacles in their airways.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flattermöss seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, examine bones and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated fladdermus reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home for eight of Scotland's ten fladdermus species.
The ownership manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threave we have a good area for flatter mice," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of veterinarian trees and a variety of favourable habitats.
But there is a lot about fladdermöss that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand more about what they need to enjoy.
He emphasizes the importance of searching for fladdermöss before maintenance within property, as it is possible that unforeseen destruction of one living could kill up to 400 females and young people, and possibly eradicate a whole population.
Fladdermouse is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their bone.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our flatter mice and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo rejects rape while his lawyers threaten to vote the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape charges against him as "false news" and says that people want to market themselves by using his name.
His lawyers will agree to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas 2009.
He claims to have paid her $375,000 to keep silent about the event, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram, Ronaldo (33) resigned the reports as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after the reporting of the requirements.
"No no no no no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything good," said the player and laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to vote in favour of the claims of Der Spiegel, which they have called "a unauthorized reporting of suspects of integrity", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "sexual damage to a amount that corresponds to the serious infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The claimed event has taken place in June 2009 in a sweat at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After having met in a night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he, according to documents submitted at the Clark County District Court in Nevada, should have raped her analyzed.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on the knees after the alleged event and told her that he was "99 per cent" a "good guy" deceived of the "sist percentage".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a compensation because she felt "reason for remuneration" and worried about "become humiliated publicly".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the reconciliation because she continues to be traumatized by the claimed event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: United Kingdom "come regrets forever" to lose car manufacturers
Great Britain "will regret it forever" if one lost his status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that Toyota UK had told BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border if no agreement is concluded could result in lost jobs.
The Burnaston factory - which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stops in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO at Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems are what car manufacturers say are the risks of the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without disclosure.
Toyota's production line is driven on the basis of "just-in-time", with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, it can lead to disturbances at the border that the industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, said the company, and therefore the production would be forced to be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid controls at the border".
"We need an appointment. We want the best agreement that, as I say, enables not only success to be appreciated at the moment, but for us to take this opportunity." he said to BBC Radio 4:s program Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we must absolutely be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite Facing Association at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that these jobs never come back.
A government official said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again," says White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Vice-President Rod Rosenstein could be "shaped in another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in elections, relations between Trump and Russia and the president's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the Vice-President of Justice, and thus threaten Mueller's independence, has given fuel to Washington swallows for months.
Previously on this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing distinguishing equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of posting the president through the 25th supplement of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
On Monday, however, he went to the White House, and reports that he was going to leave.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced, which was then at the United Nations headquarters in New York, which will be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "preferred" not to kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the senate's legal committees hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual irregularity, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI survey of charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's president, Sarah Sanders, spoke in Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been established, it may happen this week, or a discharge with a week, in view of all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some reporters would object to that statement: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The value Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to any disapproval of TV reporters like "playing for the gallery," even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds several question sessions than any president before him," she said and added without quoting evidence, "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the U.S. President, it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen us do much in recent weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors digits.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances before the collected reporters.
Health Minister writes to employees from the EU at NHS Scotland, taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express their gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already committed itself to covering the costs of decommissioned status applications for EU citizens working in the decentralised public sector of the country.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, before decisions expected to come in autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for you all.
Therefore, I would like to repeat how much I appreciate every work of employees, regardless of nationality.
Collegas from all over the European Union, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergos acute surgery after he has been affected by head damage
Tennessee State Tiger's lineback Christion Abercrombie underwent an acute operation after having suffered a major injury in Saturday's loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennesseans Mike Organ.
Tennessee States head trainer Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage was done just before half time.
"He came to the side line and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before he was placed on a bar was carried out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center hospital.
Harris added that "there are no data on the type/umfang of the injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second year student, is in its first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five jackets on Saturday before he left the game, which gave him a season total of 18 jackets.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK, and the additional money is used to help homeless, according to the new plans of the Tory party
The measure will neutralise Corbyn’s success in attraction to young choosers
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The British Ministry of Finance expects up to 120 million pounds per year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp tax when buying property in the UK. The additional money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be considered as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attractive young choosers with promises of housing with more affordable prices and to focus on high income users.
The increase in stamp tax will be taken out by individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK. The extra money will give a ride to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee is added to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on leisure housing and housing purchased for renting, which may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will take up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK. This leads to prices and makes it more difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot into the housing market.
Many well-bearing areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new play will be only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first housing.
He accused large construction companies to keep prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on housing with affordable prices to solve the "threatening dwelling situation" of the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a remarkable enough proposal for housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to wrestling without the tenant's shield.
He also wants to give the municipalities greater opportunity to build new homes.
Theresa May says: "Last year I said I would spend my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving the problems of the housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in Britain, and even for companies based in abroad, to buy housing as too hard-working inhabitants of our country.
The dream of possession of their dwelling has just become a distant dream for too many people, and homelessness is still an invaluable fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
The Sunderland leader Jack Ross says that his "final goal" is to ever become Scotland's trainer.
The 42-year-old shot looks forward to the challenge of blowing life in the club from northeast England, currently located on the third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after being sent St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-country and that's all," says Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland at Hampden with my dad, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I succeed in leading a club."
Among Ross' representatives as trainers for Sunderland are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about following such established names in such a great club. He has previously rejected the offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Only now I'm assessing success based on the answer to the question 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club belongs absolutely to the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a trainer for three years, after a period of assisting training in Dumbarton and a 15-month period as a member of Heart’s training team.
Then he helped Alloa come back from the departure to the third division, and lifted St Mirren from being close down to be winners of the mastership title the season thereafter.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his player career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a road cause," he remembers and refers to when he took the command over Alloa.
"I really thought that leadership was quite right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds weird, because I had okay results and could live in it. Besides, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
That's a lot you have to go through every week.
It's still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels quite right.
I've always wanted to practice and now I'm doing it. I feel better than I've ever done throughout my adult life."

A study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer heating pool has increased revenues for the country’s fighting pubars, but the restaurant chains have been more pressured.
Numbers showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7 % in July, but the incomes of restaurants decreased by 4.8 %.
Peter Martin, of the CGA company, who has compiled the figures, said: "Continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in VM longer than expected meant that we had a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubars went up by 2.8%. However, the restorations were even more difficult.
The reduction in the sales of restaurants by 1.8% in June only became worse in July.
Pubars and bars that offer mainly drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubars who offer food also had difficulty in the beautiful weather, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and drink something.
The results of managed pubars and bars rose by 6.6 % in that month, and food sales by 3 %."
Paul Newman at the servering and entertainment analytics RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and great sports events are still the most important factors in sales on the large-scale market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups still have difficulties, although a sales reduction of 4.8% each year is particularly difficult to deal with beyond current cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have arrived more inappropriately for companies operated by food sales. The time may show whether the more moderate temperatures that we have had in August gives someone the need for travel."
The total sales increase in pubars and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July. It reflects the fact that it is now launched fewer new brands.
Branch sales supervisor Coffer Peach Tracker for the Pub bar and restaurant industry in the UK collects and analyzes data on how it works for 47 active groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is a established benchmark in the industry.
One of five children has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents
A study shows that one out of five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, has secret accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers
A study of 20 000 students at the university and high school shows an increase in the number of false Instagram pages
The result has increased anxiety because sexual content is added there
20% of the students said they had a "head account" that they showed to their parents
One out of five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates accounts on social media that they keep secret to adults.
A study of 20 000 students at the university and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta accounts", a reference to the Instagram educational service.
The result is late to worry that there is sexual content posted there.
20% of the students said they have a cleaned "head account" that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who snatched over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who invited others to "fool me."
According to the study, conducted by the Organizations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of Independent Schools, 40% of the children between 11 and 18 years had two profiles, and half of them acknowledged that they had private accounts.
The president of the HMC, Mike Buchananan, says: "It is anxious that so many teenagers are attracted to create places on the Internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the heroes" in the board of the Scottish Friidrotts Association, Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected in the Management Board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the annual meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prominent friidrottent, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead sports to benefit from her widespread experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that sports in Scotland would benefit greatly from being a member of the board," says Beattie.
Doyle says: "I would like to be a voice for the sports and I hope I can contribute and help to lead sports in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the OS in Atlanta 1996, has totally four Olympic Gold and is now expert commentary on the BBC. He lost the ability to go for a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that the time was to show if I was to recover, and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered completely, learned to go again and now I do mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with cows share the Internet
A company selling breast pumps has caused disagreements on the Internet with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers with cows that get milked.
In order to pay attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent brush pump", the consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired advertising film with humoristic means to show the freedom that the new pump gives mothers who pump breast milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled lady with cows to a song with text lines like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but don't have a tail" and "If you didn't know it, this isn't a jewel, it's not a jewel."
The relief continues: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused conflict on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it throws light on the "fase of the milk industry".
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Like we, they have to become pregnant and food to produce milk, but their kids are taken from them only a few days after birth," one person writes.

Another comments: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and children.
But surely, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?"
Anyone else adds: "What a realistic advertising film."
Others defend the movie, and a woman admits that the song is "hysterically fun."
"I think this is genius.
I'd have got one if I still breastfeeded.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The reclame movie is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a genial product," someone writes.
Another comments: "This is a fun advertisement film that turns to mothers who pumps (often at the workplace or in the toilet) and feels like 'cossor'."
This isn't a movie that cherishes or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the film, women reveal that they all have danced with the discreet pump in the hand.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and can be carried discretely in a breast-feeding cage, which gives women freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is a shareholder and ECD on Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a dear and provocative launch.
By dragging a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk cows, we wanted to put light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while in an entertaining and easy-to-recognising way, we show the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump gives.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London’s fashion week, a two-children mother appeared at the catwalk with clothing by the designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved silently to a tent camp near the border in Texas
The number of liberal migrant children has squeezed in the height even though the number of persons crossing the border every month is relatively unchanged. This is partly due to the hatred of rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Government of Trump has made it more difficult to place the children in reference persons.
Previously, most reference persons themselves have been paperless immigrants, and are afraid to put their own opportunities on the risk of staying in the country by declaring themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential references and other adult household members would have to leave fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Authority, witnessed before the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of persons who had applied for reference to unemployed minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by criminal authorities since then.
"Because 80% of those who are either reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal foreigners.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," said Albence.
In order to deal with the children's affairs faster, officials have introduced new rules which require some of them to be in the court within a month after they were deprived, rather than after 60 days, which was previously practice, according to the staff of the organizations.
Many of them are present on video link rather than personally to bring their case of legal status before an immigrant judge.
Those who are not considered to have the right to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are released, the more likely it is that they suffer from anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, according to the staff of the organizations and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Protectors say that anxiety rises at larger plants such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s difficulty are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the plant.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without having enough time to prepare themselves emotionally and take goodbye of friends can worsen the traumas many have already struggled with.
Syria demands that U.S., French and Turkish "cupupation forces" withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to come back home, despite the war in the country in its eighth year.
Moualem, also vice Prime Minister, said that the foreign forces are illegal in Syrian land, under the precursion to combat terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the Government of Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred kind until we have liberated all Syrian territories” both from terrorist groups and“all unlawful foreign presence”.
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are primarily trained and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-three country.
As regards the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "wise Western countries" to "profit irrational fear" that enables refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They police something that should be a pure humanitarian issue."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last great rebel mounted Idlib has created an opportunity to continue with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement disrupted a large-scale attack of Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, which have three million inhabitants.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clare deadlines" and expressed the hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusrafront, which "will be destroyed".
The UN Messenger Staffan de Mistura hopes that soon the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition will be gathered in order to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and to set the way for elections.
Moualem set up conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the work of the group would be limited to "the review of the articles of the present Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a revalidation
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the re-election 2020 unless his presidency was prematurely terminated by Kingdom law and scandal, which many liberal viewers probably hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic final of a presidency ever!"
Now there are no signs that the watchers have grown tired.
Since 2014, the viewing figures at the best time of broadcasting have been doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and are almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best broadcast time, which is an increase from 1.7 million for four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has toped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during great news evenings.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a multi-year-old comic writer and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he'd vote on Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," says Nell Scovell to me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, in contrast to everything else on TV, the report from Washington can determine the future of the case of abortion, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the prosperity of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, it is possible to be an informed citizen when you suddenly have been sitting and watching for six hours at an expert panel that debates Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bombing jacket of strait leather for $15,000 ("a lap filled with hybris", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabra descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Vice-President of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about the Trump follower's rotating role crew and daily intrigers (smake disputes with NFL, praise Kim Jong-un).
If you miss a single section, you'll get on the charge.
When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and yoked inside and looked at MSNBC while he recorded a broadcast from CNN.
He was unable to tie, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be put before the Senate’s Justice Committee and the Future of the Supreme Court was in the waves.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning to the end of the Western civilization'," said Mr Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it proved that they were right."

Money from flows into the equilibrium race ever before the middle-year elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th Congress District receives plenty of money, thanks to the restructuring of a Congress District that has made two members now compete about the same place.
This recently rewrited prediction in Pittsburg is represented by the Democratic Conor Lamb, who received its place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, the Republic of Keith Rothfus. He currently represents the old 12th district in Pennsylvania, which largely overlapps the new 17th district.
The maps were rewritten after the Supreme Court of Justice of Pennsylvania in January decided that the old districts were constitutionally changed to the advantage of the Republicans.
The course of the new 17th District has led to a campaign financing struggle between the largest financial sections of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a button win in a widely monitored special election in March to Pennsylvania’s 18th Congress District.
That place had been held by a Republic for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the democrats a certain advance.
The United States considered to punish El Salvador for China aid but then backed
Diplomatics noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, with a little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the delegates turned the leader team of the Trump Organisation.
Officers of the U.S. Foreign Ministry decided to call home the heads of the American missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "new decided to no longer recognise Taiwan," said Heather Nauert's speaker in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which were estimated to receive $14 million in US aid 2017. The money would, among other things, go to drug control and development and constitute financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have struck the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
While the internal meetings progressed, American and Central American officials set up a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
In mid-September, however, high officials in the administration made clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice stopped the considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October, which is an indication of the importance of the presidential administration of the meeting, said the diplomats.
And the three American messengers returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A speaker of John Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, described by the three U.S. officials, of which two diplomats agreed to discuss the internal debates against the promise of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analytical who is close to the administration and who also spoke anonymously.
Study History
The next inevitable step could be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on the claimed violation of Donald Trump in the case of law, which is now evidence in public registers.
Mueller is also reported to control his investigation against whether Donald Trump's campaign cooperated with Russia in its attack on American elections.
If the Congress would change a majority, Trump will be held responsible in front of that congregation just when he prepares for the elections again, and perhaps finally before a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the strike fight can be.
In 1938 German officers were ready to set up a state war against Hitler if only the Western countries had opposed him and stood behind the Czech Slovakians in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbading followed.
History is about such decisive events, and democracy's indispensable progress is either hurried or bromsed.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Vice-President Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what is going to happen with Mueller's investigation, fired?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he should have proposed to record the president secretly, and wondered that he would not be suitable for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not right.
"How should we answer if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he may enter the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-year elections at a convention that holds Donald Trump responsible?
If we fail in these trials, democracy is facing a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Slovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me away to burn Sabbath lights on the table decorated with the crown cross.
With the inheritance, how could I be more than optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic in front of the meeting with Rapid Vienna
Rangers receives Rapid Vienna on Thursday. They know that victory against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal that ended unavoidably earlier in the month will put them in a strong position to qualify from group G in Europe League.
A knee damage prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to 2-2-fighting against Villarreal. But he believes that Rangers can use the result as a sprong board against greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says the 31-year-old.
"We entered the match in the belief that we could get something, and went away with a point.
Maybe we could have got it in at the end, but in the large, it seems that inevitably was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half game, and we came back in the second half game, and it was the better team.
Now on Thursday, there will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's gonna be a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can certainly get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troops are good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed well."
Women sleep badly due to fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear picture of how they wanted to be cared for, few were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the people involved in the countrywide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"The people want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take the step and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
This is how you can start.
Talk to your mate and children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices may have a great importance for the costs.
Take help from your financial adviser: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover the costs, or a self-insurance with your own resources, if you can afford.
Creating legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts from the beginning.
Create a healthcare officer, so that you can appoint a trusted person who overlooks your medical care and ensure that the nursing personnel follow your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a full power for your economy.
Then you choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions in your place and make sure that your bills are paid if you are incapable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who is on your way to the hospital in an emergency medical condition.
Would you then be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
"It is not just the economy that is at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are that?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready."
One shot several times with airguns in Ilfracombe

The police describe the shooting, which took place about 02:30, as a "single event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damages are not life-threatening, and the police invite witnesses to hear.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia in Friday. It says officials. Death figure is expected to rise.
Communications are excluded, and rescue staff have not yet been able to obtain information from the Donggala management area, a area north of Palu, which is close to the earthquake epicenter. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Centrala Sulawesi, and is located in a narrow deck on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated his 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunamin hit.
Donggala is a management area that extends more than 300 km from the northwest coast of Sulawesis.
The management area, which is a administrative region under a province, had a population estimated to 299 200 people in 2017.
The support pillars of the Central Sulawesis economy are fishing and agriculture, particularly the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Even in 1996, western Donggala was affected by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circumcifical seismic fire ring, which is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A great earthquake at the West Coast of the Indonesian Aceh Province on the northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries. 226 000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with magnitude 6.8 on the Richter scale hit south of Java, the most popular island of Indonesia, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A earthquake with magnitude 7.6 hit near the city Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A earthquake with magnitude 7.5 attacked one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Thousands of villages were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: A basic earthquake affected Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, when people were reminded of the destruction of the mortal earthquake and tsunamine 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by buildings that collapsed.
2018: Great earthquakes affected the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily landed.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former Alaska Governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, who is 29 years old and is from Wasilla, Alaska, was suspected of domestic violence, to have joined a notification of domestic violence and to have opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska's state police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a woman's acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin sits in the Mat-Su jail and is held against the $500 deposit to be paid if the suspect breaks the security conditions, according to the KTUU TV channel.
He appeared in the court of Saturday and declared himself "garanted not guilty" when he was asked to give up his attitude, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected for three cases of less serious crimes under class A, which means that he can get prison for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a case of less serious crime under class B, which is punished by one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time Palin is accused of crime.
In December 2017 he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by the Veterinary Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, of being engaged in the notification of domestic violence and of the holding of weapons under the influence of that event.
His girlfriend accuses him of having hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son's violent behavior to posttraumatic stress syndrome, derived from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia in Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity supply and communications are below, and death figures are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake hit right outside the centre of Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit circulars now on social media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered to a beach festival in Palu when tsunamin hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim rare death penalty for a suspect of terrorist attacks in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York claim death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York who killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, should have used a rental car from the building and indoor chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway on the lower Manhattan. He knocked down pedestrians and cyclists in his way at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims, and "deliberately" caused serious body damage, according to the deliberate declaration of death penalty submitted to the Southern District in New York.
Both the accusations may result in a death sentence, according to the court case.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused of a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murders to support protective activities, often used by federal prosecutors in matters of organised crime, as well as abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "abundant planning and purpose," said the prosecutors, and at the same time described the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco damage and loss," says the Declaration of Intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York’s southern territory has not been accused of in a target where it is committed to death penalty in a decade.
The advocate, Khalid Barnes, was arrested for the murder of two drug addicts, but was finally sentenced to lifetime prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in a federal goal in New York was 1953. The married couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg couple were executed both in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, who is an Uzbekian citizen, showed a lack of repentance during the days and months followed by the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the claim, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked to set up the IS flag in his hospital room, said the police.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 accusations of the proceedings.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, who said that they are "exactly disappointed" on the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to occupy death penalty instead of joining lifetime prison without the possibility of conditional release if the advocate acknowledges himself guilty only extends the trauma that these events have caused for all those involved," said Patton.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to claim death penalty.
Member of the House of Tories says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must know the "hit" of the EU skeptics when one of Theresa May's own Members suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Member Peter Bone said at the Mars in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already have "had gone out" if Nigel Farage had been the Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge that Theresa May faces in order to make the deeply divided followers reconciliate has been worsened by EU-positive tory members who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, in life under the attacks of Brexitan hangers, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU themselves.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reverse, and force EU shipowners and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "spola the Chequers Agreement".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made equally and had a responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood at the rod, we would have been out at this team," he said.
Peter Bone, representing the Wellingborough District in Parliament, added: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to spoil the Chequers Agreement."
He clarified his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to become subjects.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejected the claims that the general opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The fact that the British would have changed and now want to stay is totally unreasonable."
The Brexitan hanger Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party also attended the Mars and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Premier Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is impopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is impopular in the party and in our electoral workers who are on the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Dismiss the Chequers Agreement and start listening."
And she added a sharp message directed to Theresa May: "Premier ministers will keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians had to "know the warmth" if they would fail the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about the confidence between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say to them, 'We're not going to let you get away with it.'"
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to get our political class, which is near to betray Brexit, to feel the warmth.
We mobilise the army of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-controlling and proud UK."
At the same time, EU attendants marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the central city.
A group of activists flipped with tracks with the text "Tory Members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour Parlamentary Lord Adonis from the Overhuset ridiculed the conservatives for the security problems they supported with a party app when the conference opened.
"They are these people who say they can have IT systems on the spot and all technology for Canada plus plus plus plus the agreement, for free movement-free borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a pure father.
There's no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans a "good thinker" to candider to the presidential post.
The American senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "decent thinker to candidate to the presidential post" after the elections in November.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke of their future at a city house meeting in the West Massachusetts at Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and now set up for re-election in November against the Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Vice-President of Donald Trump's campaign in Massachusetts 2016.
She has been subject to speculation that she might be taking on Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city house meeting with the voters since Donald Trump attended.
A person asked her if she planned to go to the presidential post.
Warren answered that it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means a woman on the top.
A person arrested for the death of the basketball player Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the death of the LSU basket player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The police in Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. for ET.
They had released a movie of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man seen on the pictures.
20-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in his head and finally died of this," told police officer Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde walked between to defend her friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been in the place and had a weapon, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and was brought to prison at the police in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, and cut in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 recurses per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after the team order gave him win over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' team order would play a great role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hanged out Hamilton on tower when he defended his position during the first two yards, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went on first and let Hamilton drive in the back of the club, which should have been decisive.
Mercedesen went on a ship later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of offering on site after a double move to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seven at the end of the first shipment on his 21th anniversary.
He then led a large part of the race and held in the decks to reach a fast target and drive around Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally, he arrived in the 44th yard, but could not increase the speed during the remaining eight yards when the Raikkon went up in the fourth place.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a great job all weekends and was a real gentleman who left by me.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and a two," said Hamilton.
Very Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump reproached Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintained that she has not lucked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to Judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual abuse.
The President, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly take up the Ford testimony before the Senate’s Justice Committee, but noted that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "elaque, unclean and lieful."
"The only thing that could happen and the good that has happened in the last days of the Senate, when you see anger when you see people who are angry, evil, unclean and lieful," he said.
"You see press releases and leaks, and so they say, 'No, I haven't done it.
I haven't done it."
Remember?
Did you smell, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you lucked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't swallowed it."
Wait a minute.
He added, and imitated the senator.
The letter with details about Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was lucked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have come from her office.
"I haven't darkened Ford's accusations, I haven't lucked her story," said Feinstein to the Committee according to the newspaper The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential as she wanted."
But her dementi does not seem to have fit the president, who commented on it at Saturday night's meeting: "I'm going to tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of three women's sexual crimes, and indicated that the Democrats used the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power back with all the necessary means.
They don't care about who they hurt, who they have to drive over to gain power and control," said the president according to the mediaite digital news site.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two goals for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars sunned Friday's loss in Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received a early two-target lead through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie reckoned for the home team before Dwyer restored Belfast Giants' leadership.
Francois Bouchard quit for Dundee before two goals from Luke Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season for Adam Keefe's law, who came back and hit Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
That was the fourth meeting for the season for the two laws, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening target came at 3:35 at the assistance of Kendall McFaull in the fourth minute, and David Rutherford gave assistance when Beauvillier doubled the management four minutes later.
During the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie, who kited at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Belfast Giants was in the leadership at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The hemmalage regrouped and Bouchard recruited once again with a target in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, and he secured the profit with the fifth halfway of his team through the final period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of its last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at its next match on Friday.
Flyers died for hundreds of people on a plane to escape from earthquake
A flight leader in Indonesia is now celebrated as a hero after he distracted when he saw that a plan with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a great earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftersales continue to plague the area and many are trapped in the boat of the city of Palu.
However, despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-swearing control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the start course, could lift safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would rasp.
He retired later in the hospital.
The speaker of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from the Balikpap in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning before the helicopter came to Palu.
We are crushed by hearing this," he added.
At the same time, the authorities fear that the number of deaths may rise to over a thousand people. The country's emergency authority says that it is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death figure is believed to continue to increase because there are still many bodies remaining in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a speaker for the Authority.
Up to six metres high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft fly in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
It's bad about clean water.
The mini markets are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross struggles to help survivors, but we don't know what they will meet from there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
In the past, Indonesia was affected by earthquakes on Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now indicates that a man is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plan that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, the Pacific Sea, now states that a man is missing. Previously, it was said that all 47 passengers and the crew had been removed from the falling planet and were in security.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals, and researchers to try to find the man.
The airline did not answer the questions of more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water when it tried to land on the airport of the Chuukös.
On Friday, officials stated that seven people had been taken to hospitals.
The airline stated that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and how the event looked.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the landing course.
Some witnesses thought that the plane was passing through the landing course.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flyed very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to wash through mid - deep water to the emergency exits on the falling planet.
He said that the cabin staff had panic and screaming, and that he had a smaller skull damage.
The U.S. fleet said that sailors who worked nearby in developing a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using a blazing boat to drive people into land before the planet fell in the 30 - meters deep water.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analytics draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor concluded his pledge in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
The analyst of the US Department of Justice Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as experts in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used mobile lists to puss up the 29-year-old, Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements the night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received localisation data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contrary to his previous claims, reported the news newspaper The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber’s cell phone during the period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis said the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that evening, Sanford said he's lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile phone lists showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis for a while after Chambers' death deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He threw her out of his life," said Hale.
The Defense is planned to start its final meeting on Sunday.
The judge said that he was waiting for the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hiphop?
A hiphop-trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that the hiphop has come far away from its origin of political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a recovery in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
A black again?
A child girl in New York matches a couple due to refusal after a "rasist" text message
A child girl in New York is right a couple for discriminating refusal after she got a misleased text message from the mother who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple denies that they would be racists and compare the atmosphere with "expression".
Two-children mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed terror when she realized that the new child girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEE NOT A SWART IGEN," wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a text to his husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she had realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "pleasant to fashion", and gave Maurice fired, and claimed that their former child girl, who was African, had done a bad job and that she instead expected a Philippines woman, according to New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and was sent home in a taxi.
Now she's right to get the couple compensation for the departure. She demands compensation in the range of $350 per day for the job she was employed from the beginning to do, which would be for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected the accusations that they would be racists and said that the only straight thing was to finish Giselle Maurice's job. They were worried that they couldn't trust her when they had offended her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," said Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you convey your children to someone you had been insane to, even if it was mistaken?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously."
Plasco compared the atmosphere with "expression" and said that his wife would be born children two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Do you want to go to such a person?
This is not very nicely done," added the investment banker Plasco.
The legal process is still ongoing, but the general opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticized them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington compilers didn't think the readers could relate to a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
Paddington writer Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented as follows: "It is hard to imagine how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was released.
It's very funny, given what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She told her dad, who had worked as a cameraman at BBC before he had been inspired by a little toys bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterly loved" after his death last year.
She describes that Paddington was a "very important member of our family" and added that her father was proud in silence over her final success.
"He was quite silent, and not a screaming person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that succeeds with something. You become proud of the child even if it isn't you who have achieved it yourself.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little in that way.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he used to give Paddington himself the honor."
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken into ilfart to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked for nothing to save her life.
"Nad regularly called to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to cope," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad that said she would die within two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly out and left her body.
She had died just before, and now everything was shut down.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn't chew, cry or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who now saddled the loss of his daughter, went on board on the plane along with the other passengers who were completely unconscious of the difficult trial she was through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
"I bent my head down, and the tears ran all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sorgy women set up cards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost their family because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set a map on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to be as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney and she tells her son was a promising cock that had an infectious smile.
"All knew who he was because of his smile.
They said that his smile lighted up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling when he killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I'm always worried about consequences."
Sharon Davis created the cards "for people to know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been a friend with Sharon Davies for years, has lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, a time after his mother's death.
"He hadn't said he felt depressed or depressed or something," she says.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that he acted differently.
On Christmas, he was on the bottom, and when the children opened his Christmas apps, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says that his death was a very hard hit for them, but they have to go through it. "There is a wound in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we all have to fight on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI initiates investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - we might be able to get some consensus," said Jeff Flake on Saturday. He added that he feared that the Committee would be "splitted" due to deeply rotted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican attendants want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their opposition depends entirely on the time.
The Middle Ages will take place in only five weeks, November 6. If the Republicans make a bad choice, as is expected, they will be strongly weakened in their efforts to get the one they want to have chosen to the highest court of the country.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called Senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met her wife Ashley, who was a personal secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the death situation and confirm his election in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean dishopers "sunker" under Kim
The number of North Koreans who jump to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the South Korea Reunion Ministry, says that 1 127 people jumped out last year, compared to 2 706 in 2011.
Park says that harder border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges to human smugglers are important causes.
Pyongyang has not brought any public comments.
The majority of the hopers from North Korea are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30 000 North Koreans must have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korea war in 1953.
Most of them fly through China, which has the highest limit to North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the hardly monitored demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China views the dishopers as illegal migrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still in war with each other, has been significantly improved in recent months.
Previously in the month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for discussions focusing on fixed negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between the United States President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general to work for the Korean peninsula to be free from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, the Nordkorean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the American sanctions for the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we can absolutely not disarm ourselves unilaterally first," said Ri at a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and says he is inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court of Justice
The minority leader of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysteric" and said that he was temperamentally inappropriate to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help that I thought that if a woman had prayed so, she would be called 'hysteric'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the accusations of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when both of them were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh became very emotionally touched, and sometimes he screamed almost and the voice stood when he spoke about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats of the Committee and said that the accusations against him were a "great and coordinated character murder" organized by liberals who were angry because Hillary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed that he was party to the disadvantage of the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton couple and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she received the question if she would try to put Kavanaugh before the court if he was elected, and if the Democrats were given a majority in the Representative House.
"I can say this – if he does not tell the Congress or the FBI, he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he is at now," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently Judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might take against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion case Roe vs. Wade, because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh asked whether he would amend certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
It is not possible for a hysteric and party person to put himself in court and expect us all to applause," said Pelosi.
Women have to stand out.
It is a righteous criticism, months and years of anger that cooks over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued: "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said that she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and began to cry, she said to the person she spoke to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry.
And then she continued.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed to get out of anger partly because they are often misunderstood.
One of my most clear memories from one of my first jobs in a man’s dominated office, where I once cried out of unpredictable anger, was that I was taken into the trumpet of an older woman. It was a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of, and she pulled me into a staircase.
"Let them never see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry, and they're happy that they're able to print to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congress Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was taken away with an out of marriage business on a boat called Monkey Business and went out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason to investigate the idea of standing up in the presidential elections.
"It wasn't a well-determined decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last one they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snövit and the seven dwarfs."
Since she was late out, she was behind with the money collection, and promised not to enter as a candidate if she didn't get $2 million together.
It was a project judged to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave her $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not initiate a formal presidential election campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration from the system that made it so difficult to collect money and direct itself to voters rather than delegates, and angry to sexism, that the voice stack.
"You could have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schröder remembers the press's reactions.
"You could have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to write on my tomb stone?"
"She wept?"
Why the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The opening tire of the trade war between the United States and China was ear-determining. The war is far from over, but the sprinkle between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
The US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by investing important Chinese export products such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs.
The most important upturn came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion, which in practice means that half of all goods coming into the United States from China are customs charged.
Beijing has answered with the same coin every time, and recently, a fee of between five and ten percent on US goods for $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US's actions. The world's second largest economy will probably not drop down within overtime.
To get Washington back means bowing for demands, but public crying for the United States would be too gentle to China's president Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards right, the pressure from the US trade war can give a positive support to China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in any country, and it is actually far more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to admit," says Abigail Grace, research assistant with focus on Asia at the New American Security Tank Center.
Syria "redo" for domestic refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to accept voluntarily returning refugees and ask for help to build the country, which is in ruins after the more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are now being improved.
"The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for voluntary returning refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syria have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he emphasized that it does not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe departed with the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by conquering Team USA with the final score 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European ground and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points required to fight the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard during most of the tournament, landed in the water at the outset of the 16th gate 3-way, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was struck out 5 & 4 of the lowest ranked players of the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who may have done his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the tournament's most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I'm not usually crying, but today I can't help it.
It's been a hard year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back the victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said Garcia's touch after the victory of the European Law.
He left the stafett to his landsman John Ram, who conquered the American golf tent Tiger Woods 2&1 in single Sunday.
"What incredible pride, to beat Tiger Woods. I'm grown up looking at him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all their four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder cup.
A spectacular statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who have won 14 major titles, which has only been overwhelmed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled the whole weekend with finding fairway, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the depressing performance of the law: "I am proud of these guys, they have fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fist.
The hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really good.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the US PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we're going on.

Algflower: The stops decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from Florida's Fishing and Wild Commission shows a general reduction in algflower concentrations for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, more uneven flowers are reported in areas around the major municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate decreased levels.
The algflower stretches about 20 miles from the coast, from the north Pinellas to the south of Lee.
Flecks can be seen in the sea outside the major municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Algblomming has also been observed in the great municipality of Pasco.
Average concentrations in or outside the coast of Pinellas have been reported during the last week. Outside the Hillsborough coast low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or outside the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium-sized concentrations in or outside the coast of Lee, and low concentrations in Collier.
Reports on respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida that last week.
