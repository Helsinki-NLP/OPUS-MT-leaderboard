DFB-Chef Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for returning Mesut Özil to the National Team.
"This is a question which, of course, depends on that one gets into the conversation, that one also talks to him about why he apparently felt this as it was laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmaher" of the "picture newspaper.
Despite the now long debate on the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the withdrawal of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I also assumed until a certain time that this would be so," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had explained his withdrawal from the DFB team in July and also justified that Grindel did not defend him against racist enemy during the WM.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he is not ready for a conversation with a federal coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from the football so that if "you leave a team or change a association, you talk about it with your trainer and I'm sorry that this conversation hasn't been done so far".
Linz: Garden cabinet in Schrebergartersiedlung burnt
At 14.13 a.m., Linz was alarmed to a fire in the Angererhof Road.
Because a high voltage line leads directly through the screw-type settlement, there was a danger in delay.
The professional fire war broke out and found the tabernacle in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be practically removed for a straight way and fire shots had to be cleared in the absolutely necessary extent.
According to the owner of the burning garden cabin, he had recorded a battery to the store in the afternoon.
That might be the cause of fire.
Anyway, the charging device was in the field of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined - as well as the fire cause.
However, he is likely to be significant, for the owner had many gathering pieces in his garden cabin.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on an open street
What did Lindsay Lohan just drive to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to entice the children from a supposed refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has even streamed live, as she apparently wants to entice the children from a family in Moscow.
This reports the U.S. portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial intermediate of the stream.
Here you see "To luck kissed" with Lindsay Lohan
In the Clip you can see Lohan walk out of a car and perhaps go to a homeless family that she wanted to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family escapes just before the actor, Lohan pursues the parents and her children.
She invites adults to engage in child trade.
For all of this, she does not provide evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this right," is Lohan in the video to hear how she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from her parents.
At some time, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she turns around, and Lohan misses an earfig.
Under tears, the actress admires how shocked she is - and she keeps her wang.
What Lohan has motivated to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroid
The sun "Hayabusa2" started in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to draw closer to Ryugu asteroid so much that it can take material from its surface and bring it to earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign Ticker: The number of dead on Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of strength 7.5 and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 death victims are spoken.
The number of victims could continue to increase.
The rescue teams have not yet been precluded into the destroyed and cut off from the outside world.
Elon Musk comes back as the Tesla Supervisory Board Head
At the beginning, there was a Tweet.
In early August, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk made unrest on the stock markets when he announced a withdrawal of the Eletro autobuilder.
The U.S. Board supervisor accused him of fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk must pay, and the Tesla Chief withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but the Chairman may stay.
Participation of the British Conservatives
Heavy guard - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
On the party day it is to deal with foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference of the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit-Hardliners, to the front of the ex-Ex-Ex-Ex-External Minister Boris Johnson, is overshadowed.
Referendum for a new state name
The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state on the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been fighting about these name-dopings for years.
Now they've agreed.
The state of Macedonia will in the future be northern Macedonia, and the population is about that Sunday - whether it's okay?
Protests in Brazil against Right Populationists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the vote is divided in the country.
Thousands went on the road in several cities to protest against the right populator Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brazil" is a anti-system candidate and is therefore in the investigations.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad from the Left Labour Party.
Audi: "Dieselgate" work takes longer than planned
"The Diesel-Taskforce still exists," said the Developing Director Peter Mertens to the industry magazine "Automobile Week".
In December 2017, the arrested and licensed Audi-Chef Rupert Stadler had announced that the Task Force was soon dissolved.
"In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/drive combinations were expected to be checked," he said at the time.
Mertens now said: "Begin July, we have reached an important stage target in the preparation of the Diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the Dieselscandal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the autobuilder had made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW Supervisory Board had adopted a decision on the future of Stadler on Friday and wants to continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities propose to the Audi head that, according to the notifications of the exhaust fraud, the selling of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values should have been authorised.
He knew of the manipulations or ignored them consciously.
Currently, Bram Schot is headed by the company as the director of the Board of Directors.
Due to the conversion to the new exhaust gas and consumption test standard WLTP there are production failures at Audi, the shot of the "Heilbronner voice" said.
Basically, he sees a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment on itself is difficult," he said.
Schott sets on electrical mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives re-select to - Lahm should go to the DFB Bureau
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to recruit the office as the DFB president despite the criticism of his person after the WM-Aus and the Özil-Affäre next year.
"I do my work and try to do it as well as it's done," Grindel said as a guest on early Sunday morning at the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio".
You have to try again and again, I'll do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to its own words, the ally chief found it "noteworthy" if he, after the supplement for the football-EM 2024, did not want "to cooperate in the future project".
Grindel has been the band leader of Wolfgang Niersbach as a successor to the summer marble business since April 2016.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM-Chef organiser Philipp Lahm is to cooperate in the DFB Bureau.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues at the Bureau agreed that in this role he also advised in future at the Bureau and then, of course, is warmly invited to make his experience available in sports issues," said Grindel.
In speculations, if Lahm could become his successor as a DFB chief, he didn't want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair's photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that a national player without the migration background become DFB's integration messenger.
This office is currently exercising Brazilian cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person, without the background of migration, clearly affects the society and the football and says, "the topic is important, we need to care for it," this would also be an initiative to ensure a better basis for our associations in the place where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Decrease correctly with half-wise scale
I've had a new toys for four weeks.
A weight that doesn't just measure my weight, but also the body fat share.
Muscle and bone mass can also show it.
The Body Mass Index also calculates the thing, but it is rather for the arch.
He doesn't tell me if I've replaced fat with muscles.
Basketball-Bundesliga: Clear sequence for Berlin and Oldenburg

The new access to Rokas Giedraitis was with 20 points top scores of the dominant Berlins.
The national player John Thiemann (18 counters) compulsory from Ludwigsburg also showed an appealing performance before 9113 spectators in his compulsory game debut.

The new game maker Will Cummings surprised the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The brown-sheet, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been a majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly provided clear conditions.
Erdoğan opens Moschee in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened thisib mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at his three-day visit.
Critical in Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan urged the German government to deliver live adherents of the Gülen movement in Germany and to act against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathists of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib-Moskee, the Cologne's interior city had been partially locked.
Several thousand policemen were in operation - among them also scratches.
The Islamic Association Ditib is in criticism because it is considered to be the extended arm of the Turkish Government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against poverty: Stars, Buhs and Screaming
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have played a shared concert in the New York Central Park for more commitment to fighting poverty and diseases.
"Engage you wherever you can only," said Mendes at the festival in the night to Sunday for about 60,0000 audiences.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm ready to change the world.
Actors like Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and Assistance Organizations, were also shown on the stage in the multi-hour spectacle.
In the meantime, however, there was a terrible second when many spectators kept the noise of a falling metal locking for shots, got scared, and tried to escape.
Shortly panic came, people ran through each other.
Seven audiences were easily hurt, said the organiser Hugh Evans.
The New York Police and the musician Chris Martin then reassured the people from the stage.
"None's trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge each year on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to math a person had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the global fight against poverty and illnesses on the Internet.
For the numerous musicians and actors there was from the audience Jubel and Applaus - Buhrufe for the Republican senator Jeff Flake.
This one, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on the stage for greater equality of men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the US Senate’s Justice Committee for Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Judge at the Supreme Court and thus put many women before the head.
At least three women have raised suspicions to attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which rejects it.
Flake called for a FBI investigation of the presumptions after two women who had experienced their own sexual abuses, faced him on the way to the committee meeting in a elevator.
"You can also be happy to meet with me in a elevator at any time," Flake now said at the concert in New York to the crowd of spectators.
Press release: Federal Government defends the newspaper of the journalist
Government speaker Steffen Seibert has defended a journalist from the press conference of Kanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The Turkish journalist, living in Hamburg, had transferred a T-shirt with the Turkish and German title "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone to the first row.
The T-shirt, hadn't been the problem, said Seibert the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the expiry of the press conference.
The action of the journalist had caused a strong distress, which was not acceptable.
That's why he caused personal protectors to take the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellor Office.
This is absolutely independent of whether it is a legitimate matter or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are claimed to be spyed or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah-Gullen movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the failure of the pocket attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are not sure before the Turkish authorities: first early in September the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Lastly, the cases of the arrested journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had looked at.
Although they were released and could return to Germany, they still run processes against both in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-looking, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is well-known for moisturizing conversations at the Theke of the Hamburg Harbour Kneipe "Shellfischposten".
Modern Ina Müller, with her guests, has some beer, some wine, or even more prosperous drinks to relieve the mood and tongue.
Few promises also drink courage for the obligatory vocals.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "man's hearts", "Terror - Your judgment" or "The worst day".
The coins did not get a good trip to the high north.
On Saturday he posted a Selfie - his face is completely twisted on it, the eyes only two little slashes.
The bed Selfie shows a totally swept Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
To his fans, he posted some - probably not very serious - knowledge that he has now gained: "Regle one: Go NOT to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sau.
And spray.
And the round of edibles, which make Ina around half three, also leaves away.
Alcohol consumption is indeed in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to fight the nails.
They were enough of instant breeze, fish bread or - probably the most targetive - head pain tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the sight of the normally attractive Kinostar.
As Ina Müller has survived the night's surgeon, it has not been known.
However, since she has moderated the TV gap at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be more experiencing...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with Vandalism and Unrat
The entrance in the 36 kilometres long railroad in the Red Käppchenland in Treysa presents itself difficult to find and mould.
Recipes against grassing vandalism are searched, but solutions are hardly abstract.
Screws, cigarette hips, waste and unrat, demolished waste and now dismantled signs - so has been presented since the long-term entrance with seat group to the bicycle road on the Haaße hill in Treysa.
A more than uncomfortable view for the pre-viewed railway route in the Red Cup country.
The topic is addressed to members of the ADFC Place Group of Schwalmstadt, but also to others, according to the bike officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the Council of Bicycles.
There is no solution until now.
The proposals were sufficient from the settlement of the seat group to regular clearance of the waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the entrance site.
"I think that the latter would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says deserthagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that it has also been brought into the local board.
Not only the waste drives bicycle drivers and residents - the seating group is regular meeting at weekends for celebration.
It is not only frequently loud, the layers are also destroyed: cracked out of the earth, demolished trash, knocked shields, strained seat furniture.
Volunteers had already cleared out more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, are only the dictatorial drops on the hot stone.
They are worried that the ride is on the bikeway in Treysa meeting point for supply.
"With the entire bikeway, the Haaße hill is clearly focused here," confirms the wheel traffic officer, who now also cares for the new bike site in goat hain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be quite expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "It may be that the threshold is significantly higher to understand the common.
However, that would require that then a police strike passes over.
Basically, deserthagen wants to develop the Haaße hill.
He had to be more attractive.
The frequentation of the bicycle route so far can be very satisfied.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bicycle path is very high quality compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As an extremely critical risk station, ADFC member Susanne Klippert appreciates the situation in the Asheröder Straße in Treysa.
There's no abbie track on the hate hill.
In the case of regular traffic, bicycle drivers may have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of traffic," she explains.
This is not a problem for sporting drivers, but for older people and especially for children.
Music Contest at the Cultural Train Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in one another.
To offer "D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the city's part-offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest "with eyewitches in the sympathic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family relationship with coffee and cakes by the honorary officials of the Cultural Railway Station.
Seven formations arrived, from the one-man band to the great ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long albighter living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, a ensemble from the Kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Darties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a new one.
We haven't experienced that in other urban areas yet.
What were the texts connected with?
The Hiltruper Lake and the market sales were particularly frequently mentioned in the places.
Rolf Ihmig cut the Allee in his slaughterlike song to the "cow of Hiltrup".
The Cultural Railway Station was also appreciated.
It was always about the experience of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke experienced the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the artists or references to her creation.
So you learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now he taught guitars.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew to report that he recently occurred in Ludwigshafen - at a big event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all the way on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," said Franke.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomie.
However, there was something special for the jury's favorites - so that others can hear their songs.
A whole CD can record Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with a sound engineer.
Other musicians can record a song: Immy with his Hiltrup shaft, which was particularly impressed by Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful appearance" with ten children and two educators in Guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children came up to the final once again - and even sounded "rightly good" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, the interior of the melodie and the recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the West Falish School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the City Division Public.
The municipality had called the event to life from the occasion of its ten-year existence.
She appreciated the event as a full success.
Everyone is "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the very full cultural railway station soon.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that sit against each other.
For each page there is a view screen, four cards with keywords that - the old trick with the red film - can only be distinguished if you have inserted it.
This ensures that the opposite side can not read anything for mistakes.
On the cards, for example, to read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
Two windows.
3. Cube.
4. Festival."
These are the terms for encrypted.
For here should be advised not the terms, but codes.
A different player per team is the cipher.
He gets a code card that might be "3.4.2".
It should be advised in "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should, in this order and in this example, describe the terms "wheel", "Fest" and "window" - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as possible; because this wins the party if it succeeds twice to knock the code.
So the cipher notes and reads out loudly: "Werving" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to festival; here, of course, would be as much as "party" as possible and "price" because he has watched out at school and knows the window crash there.
So it's going round for rounds, team for teams.
You don't know the terms of the opposite - but you can better compare them with any note that the cipher gives there.
So if possible mysterious, but not to rotate the rescriptions should be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic to "decrypto" is the rule.
The players probably have to study it quite long and detailed until they can finally play.
The Declaration Video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But the one who has first released will be fascinated how much feeling is in this inevitable game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as clever as predecessors and genre prime "code names", which also puts a agent theme on a game less words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever is just about Rating and not about victory points, it can also easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and polites guests in the Kneipe
A 48-year-old man worked the police inspector Kulmbach in the night from Saturday on Sunday immediately twice.
He first showed the Hitler greeting in the Upper City of a passing police strife, later he also fell up in the Upper City in a trick when he confronted other guests.
After he clearly alcoholized the postal reference given by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspector Kulmbach in the prisonelle.
He must then be criminally responsible for the use of the marks of non-constitutional organisations.
Working work Pressig was home of the Schuh Blocks
The train station in Pressig was the turning ship in the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffer ringed to buffer, it was heard in full press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
Nobody saved that.
Then the brakes also quieted and the cargos knocked.
That was just railway pure.
Declarations that are symbolic for Dinkels' home Pressy.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place so influenced by the railroad.
Here was the starting point of the steilramps mountain line to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 hectares, has its tail point in Steinbach at the forest.
In order to cope with this, earlier train and gun blocks were needed that had their home in pressy.
In 1901, the Bavarian Land Day approved the construction of a train station with 21 casts, teacher workshops, drivers and train masteries.
"Heartpiece was the rotation disc that had a diameter of 18 metres after a conversion in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirshaid, railway historians and 47 years of professional trainer.
From the railway station (BW) Pressig, which was subscribed to Bamberg in 1968, Loks were also operated for the side routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - North Half.
On July 15, 1950, the "volksblad" reported a staff population of 160 men; 13 steam and eight elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
Electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for train and gun blocks.
From 1977 they were only used for cargo tractors.
Until 1991 at least 10,000 weights were placed in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were cancelled, in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not taken a better use of the location, including in puncto freight transport."
Still at Pentecost 1989, the Nürnberg Railway Directorate celebrated a pumpy station festival in Pressig for the "50 years of electricization Nürnberg - Salfeld".
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
Just a little later off.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The Ranger and Hemmschuhs carried out the most difficult work in train traffic," Dinkel recalls.
Every mistreatment would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Train Station Pressig-Rothenkirchen led for the conversion of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures are available here in the InfranchPlus article.
Kerbers with detective track at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledonsieger Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the Tennis Tower in Beijing, as before Julia Görges.
Kerber conquered China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spanish artist Carla Suárez Navarro.
She brought 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the Russian set up at point 13.
The swab now gets to do with Anett Contaveit from Estonia.
In the framework of the series "Art and Genuss" a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach on the weekend.
With great enlightenment, organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when in the open area of Dahlmann-Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach, the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened.
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "round around Walberla" in the series "Art and Genuss".
In the 15th year, it opened its pitches.
A great visitor speech showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 Exemplars of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Mr. Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as the chief organizer and artist.
Something surprising, but a few days ago, Hahn announced his retirement.
But with Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his task in good, young hands with good future perspective.
Both have already been actively involved in the selection of the artists and have joined flyers in the past.
This year there is also one of them designed 70-cent special brands, available at each art station, at Art & Genuss.
This year's poster can also be purchased for eight euros, designed by Volker Hahn.
Hahn was pleased with the high appeal of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler could be won from Nuremberg for the musical surroundings.
During walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly clarifies that the title "Wind Game Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and finally expresses the playlist.
They are artworks of metal or ceramics, often equipped with colourful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, the visitors are waiting on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a treestump, colourful brightened, playful with 20 wind wheels, 24 hufes and 24 alu tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun brightening through the bushwork in the background, the object works brilliantly softened and invited to consume.
From Eckental, Barbara wash neck, which prefers to dedicate in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
On halfway, Siegrid Frey from Eckental issued her work "The Wind the heavenly child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination images of tone, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Wind Game Performance" is to tail through the versatile exhibition of art.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Saturdays: singers celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the almighty, too, made their unfortunateness air at that time.
At least five of them.
They did not want partout to do so that after the resolvation of the church chor "Cäcilia" there should be no more sanges life in the city area.
It has now become a legend: they lifted the MGV 68 albashes out of baptism on a bank in the tinnbush.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was greatly celebrated in the "Huis of Meeting".
"It will be full today," said President Jürgen Holste, and he should keep right.
150 guests were there, a real success for the Albighten singers.
Especially for the anniversary, they had restored the festival of the foundation.
For years it was tradition, then there was a break.
At the point of the 50-year-old existence, the traditional festival was back there.

Fulleyball: 3. Lie women: USC II wins high-class Derby against BW Aasee
The upstairs are marching.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of USC Münster under the screen rule of Axel Büring is right right right in Liga three.
No trace of shy or fractures, the independences do their thing.
And that on 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee right well.
"It wasn't clear, but we have already left the impression," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed to it: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied."
In the evening of a afternoon birthday celebration of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good to halt the game.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deceit.
In the third sentence the guests had a setball.
"If they bring it into the target, such a game can kick once," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, with its routine forces, the USC made everything clear and brought the full exploitation to the goal.
"We all know who is in such a Derby on the other side.
That doesn't break us the neck.
I've seen quite good fulleyball phasely," Annacker did not hate with the 0:3 - and went over to the agenda immediately.
Where the trip for the Independents goes seems not to be possible after just three play days.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one, he feels confirmed: "The 3rd League has an incredible good level.
With Regionalliga Volleyball, this is not almost comparable. In the fourth League, they do not want to turn their eyes down anyway.
If the West is not polluted in the next weeks, they must look upwards.
But a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven parties.
On Saturday, it's only going to Emlichheim.
Aasee arrives in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Traumship" Heide Keller became the Star.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series could have had a condolence in her marriage-out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role by the Chiefhostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018 she went from board forever.
The series that she made to be star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with whom she was married for ten years.
"This could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled with a bag alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues saw me at the height of my eyes," Keller says in conversation with the "picture on Sunday".
First of all, she was only "the woman of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "traumship".
Because now the journalists only called at Heide Keller.
"When he liked it so well, I don't know."
She thinks it could be possible that her husband could have been very jealous, but "how many men also disgusted his conversations about problems and feelings".
Keller always tried for Hans von Borsody "the only right one and he wanted to know my fears, not my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I am adorned," as she continues to explain.
She always felt "not good enough for him.
He saw in me a emancipated woman that I was never in truth, even though I at the stage sometimes seemed frightened and courageous.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "because I was afraid that it could go wrong for another time."
On the day in front of the governmental treachership, I sat crying in the garderobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to Borsody also failed.
Why never worked with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller's love was then "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I've been much too naive to love."
The night mower who regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ Resort Zurich has been watching the ZFF opening party this time.
Our age is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the graceful shine, in which a green carpet is dug on the six-stage spot, hides it over fee.
But it's a film festival, there wants more or less famous in the light of light.
Thus, on this late Thursday night, he turns over the place to facilitate himself in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase" shortly.
Thus, the public toilet facilities sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrate their premières at the Festival: The need for a new pavilion in parters is a lot of effort to flow a luxurious ambience.
On this evening, however, it stinks in the Lord's Oase for some reason to heaven.
So out here, over to the other side of the street: Loaded guests who have just stayed at the best level in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book" celebrate the festival beginning every year with a party in the three-shot warehouse.
Its name fits perfectly with this film festival: from all the earthball are known to come the works shown .
What do you have to do with an article on this festival, so that you don't have to fall into a sleeve for its 190 partner companies?
The fold binds a band around the fühlers that have stuck him a good fee, and two bully doorsteers actually turn him in generously.
Inside, the invited forces, they dance far after midnight to live music, or are admitted by DJ rhythms, to whom they scream each other, and rinse with Cüpli exquisite hips down.
In the delicate dining shop in the souterrain, Austerns wait for slurving monks, next to the incomparable culatello di Zibello is cut freshly, a chocolate well sprayed.
And the hammer is: All the sales regimes full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been true for years, so it seems to work without large losses.
You have to love this country for it!
The Falter studys the shield at the rolling stairs: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the wheelstep".
If this was two separate instructions, he was in the dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it has surely saved life.
In the household goods department in the upper floor, the poultry cocktail, prepared with Espresso, called "Golden Eye", is suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not compulsory to this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been working for this brand for years, is not here that evening.
There, however, moves over a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
It's not supposed to be far from his chief maker.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty nearly acting like a choirnabe, walks through the amount.
He's not convicted, not confused, it's not stolen.
Especially for this withdrawal, like misunderstood, love international stars this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dance
Trainers and ex-football star Diego Maradona are happy about the victory of his team.
Argentina's football-learning Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in Mexico's new home.
After a 2:0 victory of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old trainer danced with a player in the cabin at Cumbia Rithmen, as can be seen in a video published on Saturday.

Handball: Alliance 1: ASV Send to Last-Minute pipeline "destructed on the ground"
Sween Bieletzki, Coach of the Handball Associationist ASV, could hardly understand: "So a bitter defeat". His protectives were "devastated on the ground" after the unhappy 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday night at LIT Germania 2.
They hadn't played badly - like in Steinhagen, like against Hüllhorst - over many stages, the senders.
Only the beginning phase "we have totally sleeped," the ASV trainer was indignant.
The masters of the house with 8:1, also the early outtime that Bieletzki had taken, did not fear at first.
"Bieletzki suddenly went through the team," Bieletzki assembled the second quarter of the hour.
The rest was only two gates to pause.
Especially the best sender, Marius Hintze, met another time in the phase.
After the change, it became even better for visitors.
After 33 minutes, David looked up to 15:15, and then the Staffel Switcher was almost continuous.
Four minutes before the Sirene, the precipitation still seemed to be pleasant three hits (29:26).
And then?
Include the unparticipants in the event.
Bieletzki usually avoids seeking guilt with others.
But: The 120-second-time penalty of Steffen Mühlhoff was a joke.
LIT had a good laugh and met four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought great, also standing well against seven men, and repeatedly thrown on the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a fucking victory has to come here," said Bieletzki leftlessly served.
ASV-Tore: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlagenl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), of the Pol (2).

Questions: 46 percent Merkel does not want to be a Chancellor until 2021
After the querels last week, the GroKo covers several survey depths.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD took the SPD in the Emnid Sunday beach for the picture on Sunday on the bottom for the first time.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD adds a numberer to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and come to only 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union so far in Sunday beach.
The greens reach 15 percent, the left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If on Sunday the Federal Day elections, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would receive only 43 percent of the votes together, according to Emnid.
The large coalition has now lost the majority in the Sunday question in all major research institutes - except Allensbach.
The government parties are constantly at 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Federal Day election, they received 53.4 percent together.
In the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, in several surveys the second strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach voice shares from 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty from 2 to 3 per cent up and down, depending on the share of votes.
But also the restraint of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has been significantly reduced since the Federal Day Election 2017.
At present only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the office of the Chancellor, as the Emnid survey revealed on behalf of the BamS.
Only every second (50 per cent) is currently looking for the survey that the large coalition holds up to the next regular Federal Day election in three years, 41 per cent for a new choice.
In a further survey published on Saturday, significant popularity impacts on Merkel have also been seen.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should redirect to the CDU presidency in December.
47 percent, according to Emnid, are 44 percent on the other hand.
Accordingly, 64% of the Union adherents do not want a candidate, 35%.
Excursion at Aldi: Price reduced to Love Happiness
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says that in times of tinder there are no more romantic explorers stories - he should talk about poultry in Aldi.
Munich - In times of digital "Fast Food Data" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a Kenner's place for the great love almost exhibits an anachronistic romantic.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced poultry meat, boxershort sticks at the wool table or the favorite pudding is still a better story for the later grandchildren than just a swipe to the right.
The app tinder is in the reputation to be less a contact, but rather a tight stock.
We dared to test: How do women react, but not long in the first message about the hot breeze?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood Lovestory-Potenzial is then when the love happiness precedes an out-the-eye lost-and-refound plot.
If the guy is still reporting to his worshipers under the e-mail address bio-putenvlees@gmx.de, then it sounds very good to Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorties - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this advertisement in an unknown Aldi-filial that she will also find her dreamer, with whom she has just talked about the "30 percent reduced biopsy meat".
She deserves her Happy End à la Hollywood for the belief in the magic of analogy learning.

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in business administrations
Only 8 percent of the governments were female on the date of 1 September, as the report "The Power of Monoculture" shows, which is officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday and presented the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to change their position, otherwise the international competitors will pass on to them," said Webke Ankersen.
In the United States, the UK or Sweden, purely male leaderships - with few exceptions - are no longer possible.
The remainder makes German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented compared.
It's another company culture.
The small increase in the share of women among the German stockholders is also due only to positive impulses in companies in the index of medium-sized values (MDax).
Although, according to Allbright statements, only 6.8 percent of the governments are female.
However, in the previous year, the value was still 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in recent years the leadership - the share of women was stagnated.
Last 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit again consistent women in their own interest in the next year," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled not to continue to commit themselves to increase the share of "null percent" until now.
Another picture can be found in the supervisory boards: On 1 September, the female share was 30,5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"If the same number of women were recruited annually for the governments, it would have reached a percentage of 40 per cent in 2023," says the report.

In Bonn: Notarztauto power in Taxi
A note car is severely damaged next to a street.
A 27-year-old Passant has been fatally injured in the collision of the use vehicle with a taxi.
When note doctors are called, they are supposed to help - best to save human life.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old walker in Bonn has been fatally injured in the collision of a note car with a taxi.
The taxi drivers, note doctors and their drivers were severely injured, as the police announced.
The 46-year-old driver of the note car had crossed a red amp on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then struck on a crossing with the taxi that was driving at green.
After the collision, the doctor car slided against a ampmast and a tree.
He recorded the Passant who died at an accident site.
Car driver and taxi driver severely injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the note car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from operating forces.
The well-injured 29-year-old doctor could free himself, but the footballer could not help her anymore.
Another note-in-law attempted this, however, without success.
The three severely injured were brought to hospitals.
The police, in close agreement with the Bonner State Attorney, determine who is responsible for the accident.
Somester United again loses, for Mourinho we're uncomfortable
After the blamable Aus in the Ligacup, Manchester United now loses in the seventh round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU 1:3 is underlying. The way of defeat should still be spoken.
In symbol, the scene was in the 74th minute in which the rehealed Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly brought the Red Devils back to the game.
Since they suspected an offside at the passport of Mark Nobel, all the defendants of Manchester remained standing, and Arnautovic read all the time of the world to pass the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative peak of a previously over long distances inadequate performance.
At the Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City, it is currently different.
The citizens trained by Mourinho's great competitors Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Hove Albion to a circular 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling first broke through the front side's resistance lock for the home team.
Sergio Agüero provided the sixth victory in the seventh game after a good hour and a double pass with the former gate protector, and thus also for jumping to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri struggled with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
Like the Cup-Aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londons.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only matches of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his sleeve.
Thus, after the speeches were launched with an unprecedented balance in the week, Chelsea was not to beat for the second time.
First, the Londoner eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the remise in the Liga, the Blues Liverpool also fell from the table tip.
Like City, the two London City Clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (tegen Watford) celebrated 2:0-Siege.
However, the fans of the Gunners, with which Granit Xhaka played, had to endure a success message against the surprising team from Hertfordshire County until the 81th minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart buxed an indication of Alex Iwobi unfortunately into his own gate, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
Thanks to the fifth victory, Arsenal passed to Watford and resided directly behind the big rival Tottenham on rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave upward Wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unfit at 2:0 against Southampton in the League for the fifth time in a row and laid the 8th place.
VW core mark is missing: Paris's automobile salon in the character of the Diesel debate
The Paris Automobile Salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - officially not a topic and yet on the present point: The Diesel Canal and the Ringing for Bicycles and Disarmaments should not let the German car companies leave at the Paris branch meeting.
At the automobile salon 2018, they show their news from the next week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not play a major role anymore.
The possible exchange and post-cost offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin by then, yet should be an important subject at least behind the glanishing scenes of the fairs.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have, among other things, their first pure electrical models: The e-tron of Ingol cities will come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
But officially, both were already presented.
The iNext of BMW is only to start 2021.
The centre of Paris is the new 3rd.
Overall, more than 250 exhibitors are represented in this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to autogroups, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility service and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, about a million visitors came.
At least 380 people have died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi in the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami.
Thousands are missing.
There are also more than 500 injured people.
The island had been shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first cube had the strength 5.9, the second had the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, it has resulted in huge damages.
After the cube, the Tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the numbers of victims are still significantly high.
The figures have only come from Palu until now.
However, many other communities are also affected - along Sulawesis West Coast.
Approximately 150 Bikers celebrate religious service in Werdohl
Motorcycle-Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final gods service for motorcycle drivers in the peace church in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdohl - The place before the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcycle drivers on Sunday.
After all, the final gods service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is thus responsible for the psychological concerns of the PS-star two-cycle drivers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle goddess service (MoGo) will always take place at the house Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
The end of the season traditionally celebrates the bikers in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, on Sunday, about 150 bees were gathered to do anything other than regular worship.
Already from 10 o'clock the Bolids were set up before the entrance portal of the church.
First, the Biker-Frühschuppen were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a decent curry worst.
Besides the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also involved.
The preaching took place during the Biker-Gods Service of Pfarrer Dirk Grzegorek.
The Singer-Songwriter Valerie Lill took care of the musical painting.
"Although the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill rather attacks poetic-called sounds," said Pfarrer Frank Schröder.
This was also a novum yesterday in the history of motorcycle goddess service.
Flowers Home Association celebrates a great festival: After the apple the milk comes
And also on the real day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also raised great interest.
He had his apple presses in the bag and demonstrated his amazing spectators step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when did Hartmann-Niemerg leave the children the field and let them fill the apples in the great cattle.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely diminished mass.
Not many of the children could still imagine how they should be a tasteful drink.
However, they were also able to look at this important step at this late Friday afternoon.
In shapes packed and covered by networks, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the a little apple pieces that looked like hackselgut layer for layers over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of the work was not so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran into a large vessel.
However, the farmer had already filled with specialities.
Thus he opened his "sheet box" and presented the older visitors to the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Fugtorf" was similarly large.
In a pleasant atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing but also discovered the built hipburg for themselves.
Active of the Fugtorfer Cameraship of former soldiers also engaged in the festival and invited some stations to play shortly.
The home association will also offer an action day in the next year.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp stressed, will not be the home house in the heart of the Spargel village of the place of events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also on the hand because of the subject: it will finally go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with the fourth seasonal route: "Custom situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga-Nederlage, trainer André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed Profis of Hannover 96 to himself and gave them courage.
However, there was a lot of positive things before seeing at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Introcht Frankfurt.
"It's a fucking situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96 football professional Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "It's naturally disappointing, because you always take a lot of action."
The further Sieglosen Niedersachsen, for which only Florent Muslía (86.) came to the gate, stands with two counters down and is a descent candidate in their current constitution.
According to Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) reached the gates for the DFB-Pocal winner, which, after the successful general trial for the Europe-League game against Lazio Rome, had seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's Vice World Champion Rebic was almost involved in any dangerous open operation of the Hessen and never to be handled by Hannover's Defence.
The storm, long hit after the WM, showed with his pace and enforcement capacity why he is so valuable to the entrance.
Besides Rebic, the Brasilian Allan, borrowed by the FC Liverpool, was the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurter, which began with a swift start.
A falsified headball of Lucas Torró (17th) was put in danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in an outlooking position at the last moment by the 96 defense of the Brasilian Felipe, which replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (Rücken).
The leadership for the masters fell almost necessarily and deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a fenced corner in the Criminal room, Haller extended by head before the gate, where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
It was the first federal matcher for AJ Auxerre's defender who came in the summer.
And Frankfurt was still postponing before the break.
This time Haller fitted with his storm partner Rebic, who was able to think through and did not have a chance for 96-torwart Michael Esser.
In half time, Hannover-Coach responded to the weak idea of his eleven and brought two new open forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxony played a little more courageous forward, the ideas that were incinerating remained shortly before the end, as the entrance hit.
The Hessen were much more efficient.
After a tough hour, Rebic started a solo and then lay across De Guzmán, which only had to move the ball to the empty gate.
The rest was only for the Frankfurter against excessed guests, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Cutting Despite cool temperatures, good atmosphere was found at the October Festival in the city of the city.
The Mayor of Munich Dieter Reiter created it before the opening of the 185 million audiences.
Münchener Wies'n last week with two hits.
Geising: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Creuz-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Creuz festival on September 14 or Sunday afterwards.
The festival service takes place in the city church, then then is a procession to the Holy Creuz Church with the final.
The Holy Creuz Church has the cast Christ, who comes from the 30-year war, to which the legend should have shot to a Swedish soldier.
Then blood flowed out of the gun wound.
Thereafter, a great wall journey developed to the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Holy Creuz Church.
This has not been completed until today, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, pastor Adolf Buhl recalls that the cross is a sign of hope, of comfort and of life.
Despite the significance of the Geiseer parish, the ministry was badly visited.
After the service, the procession took place to the Holy Creuz Church, and with the conclusion the church part of the Crossfestival ended.
For many years the Catholic church chor has then invited to the Catholic parish to the worldly part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty foods as well as a wide range of cakes and the weather, farmhouse ice.
In the afternoon, the parish community still offered tours around the city church, Bernd Bend Schneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors about the damage to facade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will take place until the next year.
After a period of time, the damages could be identified more accurately and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is certain that the renewal is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existed a few years ago has grown larger, but more has been detected, which was only possible by the inaugural appearance by noise.
The soccer consumption work is completed, the natural stone work is still being started before the winter, and it is hoped to be possible to finish almost half of these work this year.
Inauguration: New home in the New Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Donau-Iller life aid opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" of his destination will be delivered - there were all attendees agreed at the date of the invitation.
Finally, the twelve wheelchairers who have already lived in the living home of Donau-Iller's life aid for some time have been required to rebuild the special architecture of the new building.
Wide hills, loops and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas have taken into account architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former officer building of the US-Army was put to the test for the residents with mobile cap: "The house had come into the years and no longer in time in the equipment," said Bader backlooking.
In 2016, the baggers called to cut the house off.
The reconstruction should be made as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel well in it, according to the architect.
Living aid Donau-Iller opens new home
About 4.6 million euros invested life aid in new construction.
The Free State charged EUR 2.4 million, the district Schwaben EUR 450000.
According to architect Bader, the construction work remained in the planned framework - timely and financially.
He also thanked Jürgen Heinz, the manager of life aid.
The spagat between a barrier-free and simultaneous fire-proof construction had not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allow the inhabitants to experience freedom to move without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants who need the tools to be mobile."
In this respect, living and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real fall of happiness, because it is no longer available in today's situation."
Overall, the new home in Münsterblickstraße offers nearly 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three living groups.
Stolz is the leader of life aid, Heinz, to the eleven full-time forces who are all employed by tariff.
Germany: Sweetly complained differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, Vice-President Manuela Schwesig urged all countrymen not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after nearly 30 years of unit.
With these differences we must not be satisfied," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "day mirror on Sunday".
The goal must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is inappropriate that East Germans in the cut worked longer than people in Western Germany, but 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain that almost 30 years after the German unity," said Schwesig.
North Korea: Does this brilliant dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year Pungsan hund dog is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In the effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pjöngyng has made a gift to the South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon's office announced on Sunday, the two about one year old dogs reached their recipients on Thursday.
They then took place the border Panmunjom with three kilometres of dog feed to facilitate the "inhabitation".
The dogs with the thick white skin, spit ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the National Cultural Good of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship gift had announced the north at the third summit of this year between Moon and the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un Mid September in Pjöngyng.
Both countries also agreed to join international sports competitions such as the Olympic Games 2020 and to apply together for the performance of the Olympic Games in 2032.
In the course of mutual approximation, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test plant for rocket drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this Memorial for almost ten months, many new books have appeared, mostly answering this question in view of the past hundred years.
It is different from Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director-General of the Austrian State Archive, in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new chance for the government
Back to work - so is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU did not at last proclaim the "back to work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cassiers and other employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but is it.
If the Federal Government is now ready to return to its task - the government - then it should not be held up with term debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually bring something together after the provocations and blamages of the last weeks, it may be that Monday will show.
In the evening, the tops of the governments will meet the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to dissolve conflicts early; a doctrine from all the dispute.
Firstly, however, there are again conflicting topics on the agenda with the Diesel Securities and the Expert Immigration Act.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies get away with exchange premiums, SPD and CDU see manufacturers in the obligation to reconstruct older diesel technically.
While the Diesel crisis took place during the weekend, Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned law on the immigration of professionals.
The SPD calls for a remaining perspective for rejected asylum candidates who work or train.
The Union is strictly opposed to the "level change" from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be again dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not equally, the GroKo has joined, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Fight is good.
Without dispute, a so diverse, sometimes contradictory society does not go ahead.
In order to be constructive, however, disputes should not be reconstructed for partatic reasons on the question of His or Nonsense.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD are to fight - but they always have the reality of human life in mind.
What is possible and helps many?
With this leadership question, both the Diesel and the trail change question can be clarified pragmaticly - and thus gain confidence.
Especially that is why the People's Party must fight now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister for Visual Affairs
Does the Minister of Labour infringe the current right of service?
Daniela Holzinger wants to see this more precisely.
"A real day and night" had worked her legislates in the Social Security Reform, reported a excessive social minister in the presentation of his own two weeks ago.
In the case of a list-pilz mandatain Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is being astonished - it brings the matter now by request to Parliament.
She assumes that "the minister was just trying to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and not to announce breaches of existing service law before running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to "speak free of any suspicion".
Police rides a street in search of women's body
Marx green - Lange didn't want the police to express themselves.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben is buried.
The route is locked in the Marx green area until Monday.
It was predicted that the mediators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones, along with his leader, could finally limit the relevant place to a few metres in use.
In addition, together with scientists at the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian Monument Protection Authority in the field of the said roadpiece, a soil anamalia was discovered.
For more than a year, state prosecutor and criminal police court have been working on the missing case.
At MarxGreen, a bicycle path has been locked and studied with solar equipment, because the mediators suspect that Heikes body could have been scattered here 30 years ago during the new construction of the State Road.
Color powder and eggs: Krawalle in Barcelona before Catalonia anniversary
On Monday, the controversial Independence referendum in Catalonia is for the first time.
But already before it comes to Krawallen.
Separatists have not forgotten the postponement from autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of 1 October 2017, there have been collapses between separatists and police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence promoters, among other things, with colour powder when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
About 3,000 police officers Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues with a compliment, who were in use last year in the referendum in the elections.
When attempting to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence at that time.
The Catalan police had created a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and central government security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
However, some of the about 6,000 separatists would have tried with violence to break through the police chain, and the officials, among other things, were thrown with color bags and eggs.
Six persons were arrested that 24 others were slightly injured, called the authorities.
On Monday, the independence referendum is first year.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to distort the prosperous region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had set Catalonia under force in autumn 2017.
The then Regional President Carles Puigdemont fled to the exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also left abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the regional government and other activists of the Separatist movement continue to sit in the U-Haft.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the entry into force of the new Catalan Government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also has the right to self-determination of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected Ratlessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen are separated torlessly
Red-White Ahlen continues to take place.
Also at the FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0 distinguish.
The final light and the third last they popped up before 438 spectators in the Heidewald Stadium as gathered ratlessness.
The first half was overlookable by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, if you would prefer to get a beer or a bratworst, you could do this without concern.
It wasn't the danger of missing a torchance, because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Due to the first (harmless) Torskud of the whole party, goodslohs Nick Flock was drawn up in the 28th minute.
The best - and, in principle, only real - the Ahlener had a chance when Cihan Yilmaz FCG Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the Criminal Border.
The hosts were even harmlesser.
Their most effective action was in an early change.
Sturmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged infringement condition for him, Sinan Aygün came for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasing slowness.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Muttel aimed nearly 18 metres over the cabin and after an hour, the goods loher appeared openly for the first time.
After a ball robbery of Matthäus Wieckowicz, it was fine.
The quickly presented contant about Sinan Aygün "Kronned" Nick Flock (62.) with a slight shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) after a cornerball of the ex-ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA Interimstrainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahlener did not accept.
Only in the 91th minute, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but he also made nothing.
Angelo Daut tried to express the positive: "I like we've played at zero." But unfortunately, the zero also stood ahead.
"We were not as terrible this time as yet against wooden wicked and that, although our opponent had no desire to play here," RW Ahlen's interim trainer found.
Offensively, "all made a little bit of a bit of a pleasant" against a team that was just trying to defend.
I didn't have the feeling that we could get an adversary," said Duut.
In his passion, however, as a spectator, they did not feel like his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too hard for that.
Reserve fields Harvest Tank Market: Fortunately there are enough Kremers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler are delighted from the arc fields of table expenditure, for which these donations are intended.
The honorary officials assure: "These donations also remain in rectangle field".
At the opening, the sky appeared brightly blue, and the space, on the other hand, was a little empty, but this should still change over the day.
For: "Here it is so nice, so we are here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the Festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a regular price of Humor.
For the couple of Brockmann, which was actually to be balanced against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kremer jumped short-term.
The Verena (Daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough Kremers.
And the "replacement" could not take it to intervene musically with the increasing visitors.
That came so well that a few people songs were joined in the later hour.
"Simply great," Marcel Kremer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to present the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is happy about the many assets with their stands, including mainly associations.
"In fact, there should not be anything like a table at all," he thanked himself for the action of the men's choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the beaches and also included the further festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful attraction - here's what's going on.
Then the maize was taken down by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the firearm and brought to the winter square.
Many stances have been worked for the lifely well.
From sweet to heartward, everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative at his decupier saw.
Furniture work, beer cover with arc fields motives and some more he had in the offer.
A speciality offered three rectangle fields of Imker: "Reckenfelder Honig", accompanied by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth Buschschlötter.
The latter has another specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to access again and again, so well the cake tasted.
The celebration is it that the visitors then made for a long time to the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Smieries with local political message: No successful advertisements for skate plants
In Lengerich, the unknowns have probably scarcely worn a supportive way for the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are similar smieries, Jürgen Kohne says from the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been punished for damage.
In large letters, the three words "Scale Park for Lengerich" are on signs, including at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Rathaus.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Halle, reports that after the trade fair on 19 September, a corresponding writing on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt-Bistro had been discovered.
Since the short message at the time apparently had been left "only" with an oath, it could have been easily removed.
"A few days later, however, it stood back, this time sprayed up," said Rottmann.
It assumes that the relevant advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note gets just this case by calling several large companies from Lengerich on the table.
When the skate plant is built, its implementation is also possible by sponsors.
Assignments already exist, Jörg Hesselmann explains from the urban field of school, sport and culture, without name.
But well possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the shamed table.
For years, local policy and administration have been dealing with the issue of Skateanlage.
After the old one had been degraded at the LWL hospital, after a while, the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council expressed a majority for the firearm parking lot.
However, this thought was not implemented - too many factors seemed to have spoken against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, a turn was followed.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area of the Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word then has the City Council.
He goes from a decision this year so that a positive vote can be built in 2019.
Engpass in flight security becomes even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in summer, the German flights do not see any signs of improvement in the next year.
"This year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind, and then the storm will come," said the head of the trade union of air traffic security, Matthias Maas, the German press agency before the airport summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
A major reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-known staff need for European air carriers, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," said the trade unions.
The market for complete trained lotteries is empty throughout Europe.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized that various air traffic trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hansestadt, representatives of the Federal, Countries, Aviation Security, Airlines and airports will meet on Friday to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work digging and overtime, this will not go without us," explained the director of the GdF, who has many members in the Federal German flight security.
Maas reaffirmed the EU Commission's requirements for the Lotsen-Messes.
Transport forecasts for the regulatory period in force by 2019 have been much too low.
The cost and staff savings derived from it in the national airlines are now fully related to the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister for Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to take action in Brussels for regulations that "do not cut the air further".
At present, EU standards would be agreed by 2024 and further intensifications would be feared.
The EU is subject to constant lobby pressure from the airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now harvest exactly what they have seen in the last few years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high delay costs in the airlines should be reconsidered.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German Air Safety (DFS) offers a "stimate training and future pact", Maas said.
The up-to-date recording of 120 lottery schoolers over the next five years was just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary staff building is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board agrees for Group Construction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans for reconstruction of the group.
Following the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Commander Guido Churchhoff, who was appointed to the Chairman at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group should be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies should have their seats in food and be listed at the stock exchange.
In addition to the reductions already known in the administration, there should not be additional staff reductions.
After two retirements, the control body counts only eight heads on the capital side.
Ten representatives of the employee are against them.
However, the final decision is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is intended to include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be linked with lifts and deliverys.
Barcelona: Violence at Demos by police officers and Catalan independence promoters.
During two time-like demonstrations by Spanish police officers and Catalan independence supporters in Barcelona, there have been violent conflicts with many injured people.
According to the city administration, on Saturday, about 3,000 policemen from all over Spain gathered together, and some 6,000 independence advocates demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried with a great invitation to keep the two protest trains away from each other.
According to the employers, however, independence practitioners repeatedly tried to break the security barrier.
You'd have attacked the officials with color and gun shots.
According to the fact, the data also existed between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told me there were six arrests.
Better salaries and valuation of colleagues
The police had wanted to appreciate with their demonstration the colleagues who had done almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum prohibited by the Spanish Central Government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
People of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unjust that Catalan and Basque police officers deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it as a provocation that the Spanish police provoked in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrant Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they drowned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearians, who wanted to give his name only with Daniel, rejected the presumption.
"Of course, we want to support our companions, who have done their duty last year only: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is here to implement our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it is a big European city and there is more Echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.

Football: Juve-Trainer praises by top party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese Star Storm "played the best game this evening with the half hour of Valencia," Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri praised after 3:1 (1:1) - Victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer the expensive star was also without its own gate of the decisive man in the important party against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and makes it good," said Allegri.
Although we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment on we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo's three gates, Juve turned the game after the early back door through the hits of Tris Mertens (10. minute) and first depended on the worst persecutor.
The Torjger, who was taken from Real Madrid, first set up the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who provided the leadership with a double pack (26/49).
And Ronaldo, after a corner of a headball, also made the preparation for the hit of Abwehrleiter Leonardo Bonucci (76).
"He gives many templates," the trainer praised.
But Allegri also wants to see gates from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record tower protectors.
"We need to be better in serving him," the coach asked.
Best Juve tower protector is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus' power seems to be even more challenging.
Seven victory in seven games is the makelless series in the series A. At 21 points the master of the seven years left already has six counters forecast on Naples.
The table distance trained by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not at risk to Turin.
However, at the latest after the reference of Mario Rui, who was already confused, (58), the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to get too hard in against Paulo Dybala with yellow rot from the place.
"We have played well against a good navel," commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel in touch.
The German national player has been engaged in Juve.
The professional from FC Liverpool was in use at all seven Liga parties.
The middle field actor also played in the Champions League Party against Valencia, who meant Allegri with the "half hour": Ronaldo was flying from the place at the 2:0-winning of the Turins and is locked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly circular appearance, Rapper Kanye West at the U.S. TV show "Saturday Night Live" on the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided for scratches and question marks in the audiences.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a change in name for the publication of his new album.
Afterwards, you can only call him "Ye", says the musician.
"The being that was known earlier as Kanye West," he twittered to the deceased singer Prince when he dealt with his artist's name.
However, the pseudonym is not a news.
Already the tenth album appeared under that name.
In an interview with the radio broadcaster KRRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most common word in the Bible and there it means "du", says the Rapper.
Football: Circular A1 Münster: Finally!
Got it!
Howtmar's trainer Averhage didn't make a hail from his disappointment.
This was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simpler, we have never put him in trouble.” Thus, the list of Hoetmar's intervention options is read.
Grade two torchances in 90 minutes, so you can only rarely make games positive.

The SG also had only two possibilities during the first passage, the first but used Maik Krause from a spitze angle to early lead (7.).
In the 43th minute, Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great pre-working of Krause he was free to stand.
The hosts had only a double possibility when Moritz Höne first missed Torsteher Jos Schumacher and also found his master in the post Jan Blome in the poster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good opportunities.
But Uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61,) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) forgave all.
A tradefmeter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with hand on the gate line and saw red for it - also Niklas Eilmann could not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stuck the ball over the line, the party was decided (81).
"We had previously criticized ourselves hardly, then it was different today than in the last weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.
Tore: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.).

Football: Circular A2 Münster: Spectacle Football in Albighten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't know what to think of it," he said.
"We haven't got access to them at all." With that he supposedly meant the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all other green whites, which came up with a collective pressure.
Yet he could laugh, "A dirty victory," he said, diminished frightened and moved from then His players, the relief was noted that they had withdrawn from the deal with three points.
Well noted, after a duell of two teams, of which one, namely albachts, plays the mastership and the other, Albersloh, fights for class content.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainers Sven Lewandowski looked back to the 90 minutes behind him.
"This was with distance our best season performance," he says.
"As we come back after the 0:2, as we hold against one of the top teams of the League throughout the game time, that was really phenomenal."
It is so bitter that you have to go home with empty hands.
Top-Torjager Lars Zymner led the host with his 12th season hit (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2:0 he put on the left side muster valid for Fabian Fröning (39.).
We knew that, but you can't keep such a player out completely.
"This was already crazy what he did," Lewandowski admitted the quality of the opponent.
Shortly before the page change, his own eleven made the compensation: McGill's left-hand free struggle sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-torkeeper Hinkerohe through into the long torch (45.).
After the page change it was again McGill who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went down and down.
It was a tricky, action-loaded game.
Nübel again shocked albights (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann looked like (69.).
Despite the overnumber, Albersloh was no longer able to reconsider the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We now have to focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against cabinets, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tore: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Frost (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).

Football: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-Duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.

Media: Total Bureau of Dynamo Dresden
The entire presidium of football-Zweitligist Dynamo Dresden has returned media reports.
In the evening, several media were in line with a joint letter of the Sachsen body.
At first, there was no confirmation of the association.
The reason for withdrawal is to be internal power fights with former federalists.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
I'm glad he's gone again.
There are only a few nationals whose departures to Germany provide as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days the Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many had meant that he should not have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings until the middle of the next year.
This is why France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled to want to get the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulf was the term of office too short: as the Federal President, he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and afterward, Wulf was a guest there.
Thus he received academy director Udo Hahn when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Bundeskanzlers were already with us." That at the Academy at Tutzing Castle, prominents appear again and again, but the presentation of the annual programme was also a topic.
At the end of October, Songmaker Constantine Wecker participates in a meeting on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: he wants to take the "tolerance price" granted to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which also receives television modernator Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The around 80 meetings until mid 2019 have it in itself.
"The pension is just not safe!" stands in a session title.
"SOS at Europe's borders" - so the Academy describes the "risk and fatal route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting on Syria: "Barbarei without limit".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war curses any human idea."
From structural racism in society over the slope between arm and empire to radical change in work through digitization, the spectrum is sufficient.
Academic director Hahn convinced himself: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to search for solutions or at least for partial solutions."
At a meeting for 200.
Karl Marx's birthday soon expects a more visitor to the direction of capitalism criticism, others rather a tendency "from the left to the middle".
What about neutrality?
"We're 100 percent a daughter of the Evangelical National Church," said study director Dr. Ulrike Haendel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral."
Music Catalogue: gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian News
"Suitable for adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christkirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret testimon, doubners took up the gender understanding, not only with humor and heart warmness for the (sensitive) woman and the (sensitive) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar put her in and also mastered her violin.
On the wing, Ben Süverkrüp was sitting.
It is one of the male sparing partners, which sometimes speaks to the end of the phrase, one true pianist: so kingial harmoniously accompanied Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have desired a solo.
It was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, as it fitted with the red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had played a paradox: The satisfaction comes with the man if he has a partner, but does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, however, does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: What would have escaped from the composition of Mozart, would "the Nannerl" have opened the door unhappyly?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bachs "O head full of blood and wounds" into the "song of death", and from Mozart g-moll symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full room.
Flowers delivered Karlheinz little, treasure master of the association, the Chansonette.
But the president Heidemarie Markenbeck was not able to take an additional thanks.
She had the idea of joining the Duo next to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women-Landesliga: Ahlener SG keeps against TV Wattenscheid nearly the white West
The Ahlener women had problems especially with the third party player Carolin Stallmann, who only marked ten matches.
"I was, in fact, well satisfied with the refusal, only one player has made too many gates.
We didn't handle them," said ASG Coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry about the many outdated chances.
The focus at the end made his team missing this time.
Therefore, the ASG ran nearly until the end of a remnant, lay at the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.) back.
At the end, the broader bank of the hosts made itself decisive.
Aydogdu also put the backspace of Merle Klement on the left outside, which then made "extrem clever the decisive gates" (Aydogdu).

Fulleyball: 3. Liga Women: BSV East Bevern's top performance at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the fulleyballers of the BSV Ostbevern have again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd Liga West.
At the Second-Descending VC Allbau Essen, the blue-whites won with 3:1.
"This was a giant step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the upper third of the League.
This is what we have worked out now," was Trainer Dominik Münch glad to have a almost vague performance of his team with the broken table leader.
The first passage dominated the guests almost by popularity.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12, he went to the Vice-President of the previous year with 25:15.
Food has accepted in the two lock, but hasn't come into the game.
We've been busy with her.
Our opponent has made a high risk but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV already led to 12:8. "Ethat has turned the adoption to triangles.
We couldn't hold the pressure.
Food has been sucking, and we have let ourselves go a little bit," so Munch continues.
At 18:17 the full-eyball women from the ruhr area had the nose first.
Although East Bevern, at 19:24, still resisted four balls of sentence, the fifth attempt found his goal.
"The game was now a class better," the training leader was at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to turning the BSV in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: "There we played consistently and quietly".
Over 7:3 and 15:13 The blue-white passage brought four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was elected to be the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also caught a great day.
BSV Women: Eggenhaus, Rüddingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish municipality: Moskee opening as a missed chance
The Turkish municipality in Germany (TGD) criticized the way in which the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan invigorated the great Ditib moskee in Cologne.
"The Moskee opening in Cologne has left in the German-Turkish relationship a creeping hop that can only be conversed hardly," said the Chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the editorial network of Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance of a common, compassionate appearance.
"Statt side on side with German top politicians to underline the belonging to the Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the date for its purposes," sofuoglu complained.
The widespread exclusion of the German public has "protected many reservations".
Home Association Nottuln: Offer has already established

On October 18th (Thursday) at 19.30 p.m., the Home Verein Nottulln organizes its fifth Nottulner Folkträff in the fireplace of the Old Officemannei.
It's almost exactly the day that we've done a folk hit for the first time, it's a year ago.
In the meantime, this event has become a solid part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln", welcomes Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Home Association.
I wouldn't have thought that our people's hit brightly in Nottuln eta.
Whether or not the storm depth of Friederike in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace of the office mannei was always fully occupied.
"The next folk hit program is like always a colorful mixture of German folk, hiking and sailing songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who always invites friendly musicians to nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer promised his accordeon for the first folk hit "burst day".
He was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighbourhood of Steinfurt, who played music with platt German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish people band.

From pure fruitbuilding to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stammberger Hall, the 125-year-old existence of the Circle Association for Gardenbuilding and National Care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit show in the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus was set the last foundation simpulse for the Circle Association for Garden Construction and Landpflege Kulmbach, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Culmbach City Hall on Saturday night.
At that time, he was called another: "Centre Culmbach City and Land" he was raised by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa from Baptism in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-building association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit-building, about flowers and gardening at that time no one thought.
"To that time, in the era of information, the fruit tree was a favorite son of the elites," explained Kreisheimatpfleger Günter Dippold in his festival lecture.
Fruit trees should swim distance roads, in schools so-called industrial gardens were built.
The planting of fruit is still a task of the 55 gardening associations in the Culmbach district, which comprise nearly 7000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Natural gardening, biological plant protection, village refining and diet plays an equally important role as providing knowledge, healthy food and youth work.
The diversity of the tasks of a gardening association showed the members of the Hutschdorfer Jugendgruppe "Maulwürfe" entertaining on the stage.
"Youth work is urgently necessary especially in the digital age," said the Circle Chairman Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The castania collection was a giant thing for us children, I doubt that you can gather with smartphone & Co. similar much joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are to stand, the Circle Association decides," added Landrat Söllner and highlighted the special importance of the garden associations for the villages.
The Circle Association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the countryside also made it unquestionable to circumference managers and specialist consultants Friedhelm Haun.
He conducted the many visitors with a picture lecture through the long history of the Circle Association and reported, among other things, the need for self-care after the war.
Earlier everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was indosted.
At the end of the 50s, however, the use garden had changed to a cider and living garden.
"The nature has stocks, it was already before us and we have to orientate ourselves to her," the professional pleaded for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, for the gardening associations there is a encouragement to not leave so that our home remains beautiful and living.
It also includes greeting the new citizens in our associations, the president of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the exlating decline in insects, which we are guilty of our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif closed the successful festival that was celebrated feastally by the towers of the musical association Thurnau.

Priority for Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister
Mexico's government wants clarity in Nafta's matters: they put both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
The Canadian Foreign Minister now admits absolute priority to the trade agreement - and moves her speech before the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure of ringing for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed its speech at the UN General debate in New York.
Instead of today's Saturday, the Minister would speak before the United Nations Assembly on Monday, her speaker Adam Austen communicated.
In the meantime, they focus on the re-treatment of Nafta.
On Friday, the Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs Ildefonso Guajardo had declared that Canada's negotiators and the United States would have 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between his country and the United States.
In August, the United States and Mexico agreed to recast the regional free trade agreement Nafta.
U.S. President Donald Trump indicated that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The discussions on a new edition have been running for more than a year.
By Sunday evening (local time) they are now to be completed, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the event of a failure of negotiations, Mexico's designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador had announced on Friday to seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protest against Presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro injured at a knife attack left the hospital.
The right-extreme ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lived, after a report from the newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will take public appearances in the South American country before the presidential elections last week.
The politician had been attacked on an open street during a electoral event in southern Brazil in early September.
In the meantime, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people went on the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (German: "Der nicht"), women's associations had called up protests against the ex-military.
In the social networks, the associations also made mobile statements against Bolsonaro's racist and femininist statements.
In the economic metropole São Paulo several thousand demonstrators were expected.
In the capital of Brasilia, the protests joined the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He came to the place of ex-president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment because of corruption and is therefore not allowed to admit.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7th.
As the ex-burger champion of the city of São Paulo, Haddad was located in surveys far behind the right-extreme candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, it presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first election round, there is a vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not come out of this successful - no matter who he's attacking.
Bolsonaro is known for the fight against homosexuals and blacks and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocked with verbal locks.
Another time he said that the followers of Lulas' left worker party should be shot.

Larsen had become familiar with the band Gasolin', which was very successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the resolution of the band in 1978, Larsen was successful as a solo artist.
He sold around three million plates in Denmark.
His album "midt at night" from 1983 is the most sold album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen appreciated Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "Straßenjungen", which "was against everything but in all the hearts".
The Head of Government also recalled that the monarchy gentleman Larsen had occurred in 2010 on the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rocknight in the shoe factory: Volume on press air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bonesaw and tend a conzertabend with the power of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" lay such a description of the rocky live musical experience at Saturday night in the room of the city centre of Schuhfabrik near: Hardrock pure from three other friendly bands.
After the sound check and shortly before concert starts, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace from lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and surroundings are enthusiastically enthusiastic - all in connection with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Even the Quartett "Tiger Bonesaw" with Frontmann and Gitarrist Dennis Hadrika knows to convince to the discovery of the concert tabend with the latest, unknown pieces from their own feather and the next CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced for a stumbling and printing interaction.
Although "Award" calls are not to be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the Trio "Here We Stand" the stage.
That hardrock is not the same as Hardrock, thereby demonstrating Gitarrist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and killer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes memorable sounds of classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the Tigers, a synthesizer will also be used at "Here We Stand" in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the thrilling, precisely balloading "Take Me Home" covers by switching melodic passports to the guitar-lasting rock reefs of the many songs.
However, the Quartett "The Ignition" from Tonnisjäuchen has played a special degree of knowledge since its foundation in 2005.
Full agility the band presents its hardrock on Saturday.
That "The Ignition" with its appearances before a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the tournament in China in 2017 - has special stage experience, is obvious and unforgettable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann play with the band also at the only coverted song of the evening, "Word Up" of Cameo from the 80s, very own accents.
Gitarrist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a rejoiced solo while he runs through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume belongs to such a hardrock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the Mixpult team, the threeer concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at press air hammer level, but is still clearly below the "wack-fesitvals", pointing to the "The Ignition" on their website.
Ear-beavering 120 decibels in thin-drive loudness as usual at the annual metal plate in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlener audience does not need to eat at this rock night.
After nearly four hours, the three bands of the harder rocky gangart have long been convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, have taken the bone saw and burned a conzert with the power of a tier," all three groups, freely in transferred mind, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of visitors.

A dead man at sailing aircraft accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
At Mülheim/Essen Airport, there has been a fatal accident.
On a parking area at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailing plane crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
Near the airport of Mülheim/Essen has happened to a fatal accident on Sunday.
As the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung reports, a sailing plane was crashed at the fair park at the airport.
The pilot died.

The plane was already in the landing flight at an accident time.
The crash site is only located near a festival on the airport area.
But a October festival has been held since this weekend.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the city border of the two Ruhr district cities and directly on the way to the motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park&Ride offer at large events in the fair food or the Gruga Hall in food.
Trump Hears Kim, "And then we're in love"
The fact that the U.S. president of North Korea's powermaster Kim has been very well-successful despite the nuclear crisis is not a mystery.
Trump, however, has made a genuine declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the age of 72, the married U.S. president has known a new flame.
The tragedy: It's a remote relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made a unusual declaration of love to the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un.
Before trailers in the state of West Virginia in the United States, Trump found almost awesome words for the half-old spross of the dominant dynasty from Pjöngyng, although in the rings around North Korea's nuclear disarmament proved to be quite tough.
"I was tough, he too, and between us it went down and down," reported Trump.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote wonderful letters to me, they were great letters.
Her personal connection also carried political fruits: Trump referred to the stop of all atomic and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics see little more than lip confessions thereafter.
That the affection for the "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - that would not be any memory, the U.S. president seemed very conscious.
In any case, he took the anticipated criticism of it at his appearance in a large sports hall of the city of Wheeling immediately before: "Donald Trump says they've been in love."
How terrible is this?
That's so unpresidious.
But take care of him very little, Trump explained and then directed his finger to the crowd: "I always told you that it is so simple to be presidious."
But then there wouldn't be 10 000 people pushing into this prall filled arena, but we would have only 200 people standing outside.
October Fest loks many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visits, stunningly and above-three convened by sunset: Very varying and with a good shot of Octoberfestflair, Baesweiler's inner town has punched out on Sunday.

Refugees saved thanks to video from Libyschem prison
Nigerian refugees have pointed out their catastrophic arrest conditions in Libya by using a mobile video, allowing their salvation.
In July, the group had worn the recording in its cell in the coastal town of Sawya and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the "France 24 Observers" website whose editors alarmed the International Migration Organisation (IOM).
The refugees were finally fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we probably couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya in attempting to move over the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he was, according to his own statement, in danger of life.
One of his competitors was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They all hit us with pipes and stains."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary withdrawal of refugees struck in Libya.
Some 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their home this year using the program, said the IOM speaker in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the bad conditions of imprisonment in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a phone call.
International organisations have long criticized the situation in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy for human beings.
The North African State, which is dominated too wide by militia, is the main transit country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

German was caught in his own car for days
A 75-year-old has had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central francs after he had drove the car off all the forest roads and a tree blocked the car door.
Saving forces discovered the car on Saturday afternoon accidentally close to a pasture and liberated the missing since Tuesday night, the police informed Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was reported to be in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without health care.

Laschet encourages legal state in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) has invited the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to speak with its own legal state in Turkey.
The relations of the two countries are currently "overshadowed," said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Kölner Airport.
In particular, it concerns arrest waves, the freedom of press and religion.
He therefore made it clear in Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that legal state is a very important condition for it.
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans in prison in Turkey, according to its own information.
He formulated the expectation that freedom of speech was respected.
Erdogan then again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
Laschet and Erdogan had been transferred to a short-term building of the Federal Defence Ministry at the Kölner Airport.
Originally, it had been supposed to take place on the castle of Wahn - but the castle owners had rejected it from political conviction to Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan continued to open the Ditib Moskee in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Missing confidence in the United States: North Korea demands disarmament
While the U.S. president Trump is not tired of stressing the successes of the negotiations on denuclearisation of North Korea, the Eastern regime represents the conditions more nutritious.
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri calls for an abstention of Washington.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has proposed the U.S. government at the UN General debate to block negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its remaining sanctions.
"The recent stop is, therefore, that the United States builds on forced measures that are fatal to trust training," said Ri in New York.
A disarmament is indispensable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we will be the first of ourselves," the North Korean Chief Diplomat exhibited.
That criminal measures North Korea could force the "none" to be "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed a nuclear test, Ri highlighted.
However, from the US side there were no "responsive reactions", the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and rocket programme, the UN Security Council had decided three times last year on sanctions against the internationally isolated country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his foreign minister Mike Pompeo in recent days urged the United Nations to strictly comply with the penalties.
At the same time, the US government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump had met Kim Jong Un for the first time in North Korea.
After the first summit in Singapore, the U.S. President attends a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will reconsider to discuss the end of the North Korean nuclear program to Pjöngyng.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
That they were actually in a youth strike, of which the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing with: White ceilings and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the harvest thanks to God.
The youths of the HoT had magnified the buffet with costics from different countries in the new cuisine.
The institution was financed by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start of the new establishment was not just easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were best prepared on the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break came the bad surprise: a power loss had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food had been corrupted and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start from front again: although we had a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and youths wanted to do it alone," said Westbuer.
And that's how everyone was dealing with.
The result could be seen that the guests were enthusiastic.
"Beter it can't be cooking either," a visitor praised, while Hokkaido was served or the guests were allowed to use quiche, liver cheese or cake.
"It's really great what the children and youths have put on their legs," emphasized pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan lammers with cardentricks and other pieces of art made surprises.
Jürgen Sator leaves the state board NRW of the table
The head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, gave his posts in the National Association from frustration about criticism.
Sartor had become widely known because the Essener table had introduced a postponement stop for foreigners.
He had already retired in July as Vice-Chairman of the NRW tablets, Sartor said the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen too many in my back.
The Chief of the Tafeln-Landesverband NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding to the dpa for the decision of his long-term vice-president.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
"I can take his step - that's where people who didn't know exactly why the Essener table did it."
Sartor is still active for the Essen Table - "six days the week, because nothing changes," said Weilerswist.
Sartor criticized colleagues from other tables in the "World on Sunday" again.
The approach must not be pursued, "without us, the people in the city are hungry".
It is the task of the State to ensure that people are not hungry.
The Essener did not participate in a conference of the tables on Friday in Berlin.
"There's too much sweet shame told me," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that criticized me then too.

The first victory also came to VfB Stuttgart.
Against that due to a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic before the break, Werder Bremen had to fear the Stuttgarts in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the unnoticable Goalie Ron-Robert Targets furnished a curiosic inquiry owner that helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely happy debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
Gladbacher, who joined the Swiss Quartett Yann Summer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave a two-way leadership, played at last 2:2 and still waited for an outward victory in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg's compensation at 1:1 with his second Federal Religor.
Yann Summer was powerless at 20 metres of the Aargauer, as well as the second hit after an hour.

Macedonian votes on new state names
Today, in Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens agree on whether the name of their country is to be changed in northern Macedonia.
In one case, the nearly three decades of swallowing conflict with the neighbours of Greece could be solved.
Atene had been subject to a change in name because of his similar northern province and blocked every approach of Macedonia to the West.
The voters therefore also decide on future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could soon become NATO member at a positive outcome of the referendum.

SPD politician: John Kahrs marrys his friend
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-year-old friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, they gave themselves the vow in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been in question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
"If we marry, then right." He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old cahr is a budgetary speaker of the SPD Bundestagsfraktion and one of the speakers of the Seaheim circle, the Conservative SPD Floor.
In the Bundestagsdebate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs was excited with an upset on 30 June 2017.
Thus he had suggested Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have been "storted" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski Moment," he said in suggestion of the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, equal sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.

Garden Day: 400 meters of hill cut
There was a lot of work in front of the members of the Citizens' Association Children's House and the Society for Lepra.
Because about 400 meters of hills around the gardens of the pope houses should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce costs," said the President of the Civil Association Walter Schröer.
And it also gathered a lot of things.
Because of the hot summer we're late this time, but fortunately, it's just a shape cut.
Because already in the spring, the hills have been cut.

"It's all supposed to stay in force," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner takes gold at the Kanuslalom-WM
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal in Rio de Janeiro at the end of the Canuslalom World Championship.
On Sunday, the 29-year-old took a perfect course on the Olympia Street.
Two years ago, he had missed about three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, had already enough rides here on the plant and it's all right today," said the London Olympia third in 2012.
In the goal, he threw his paddle away from joy, and both arms were conceived to the height - well knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.

The second was Jiri Prskavec, the Czech Republic, before the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The police inspector Gauting mentions the first inclusion of this autumn in a single family house.
Fortunately, the offenders failed.
The days will be shorter - that's what inbreakers want to use again.
So the police inspector Gauding mentioned yesterday the first inbreak of this autumn.
The fact that it remained at the Einfamilieshause on the Royal Road is due to the alarm system.
Because it went out when the offenders put hand on Friday just 20 a.m.
The inbreakers knew that the inhabitants weren't at home.
The alarm system, however, seemed to surprise her so that she escaped without a bite.

Pleite at Hertha: Reality: Bayern against Ajax required
The prediction is inconsistent there: the defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern to "not be pleased".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate phase for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small amount of performance under the new coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase for the coins to the greater herbly depth.
"A week ago, they had the impression that we are invincible.
Now, Thomas Müller has picked us up a bit of the reality," according to the deserved 0:2 downside at Hertha BSC, Thomas Müller found a reaction to the Champions-League doll with Ajax Amsterdam.
Whoever knows us, he knows that this really hurts us, and that's why we give us the way Tuesday gas.
For the first time for more than a year, no own gate shot out, like at the same time of the presaison two compulsory games in series without victory, the table management in the football League first lost at Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as to the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running-intensive man-gen-man-tactics and the Berlins through their playrical needle pieces over the outside have delivered two blue breaks within three days, as the last superpowered Bayers are to knock.
"They who know the FC Bayers know that we don't like it and we will do everything so that we'll be successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his birth town and only pushed his first defeat as a coach of coachs on the re-infringement of opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would make the first intermediate phase of his term of office positive, otherwise the tone might be intensified.
So Kovac did not take extraordinary measures at Benfica Lisbon before the second king's Class appearance of this season after 2:0.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which had also forced AEK Athens sovereignly with 3:0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also do our gates again," announced National Team Captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost Pokalfinale against Introduct Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clear text in particular.
The legal defender appeared in the role as Mahner.
"I don't think that's all of this prick, we have to work it again, because we don't make the many chances and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old emphasized shortly before departure from the Olympia Stadium.
On the seventh playday of the previous playing time, the Bayers were already behind Dortmund with five counters, which now took the top with one foresprinkle.
And so Kimmich appreciated at least positively with an eyewitcher that now the public debate on the supposedly inconvenient Bayers has ended.
"Yes, that's all right," said the National Player.
It's good for the Liga.
DFB boss in gun line: Özil-Causa: sharp attacks from Erdogan to Grindel
The Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan, with heavy presumptions, is exempting Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees errors, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel struggled around the degree of durability in the Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President criticized the deal with the former world champion in Germany to open the great Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB head defended the association line.
In the early Sunday morning, the Grindel personally attacked by Özil announced consequences from the Causa in Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio".
"In the future - because we also have many players with migration background in the U-manships - we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without the background of migration as other integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel again explained that Erdogan does not stand for the values of the football and the DFB.
In sharp words, this man had prosecuted racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil and our Ilkay, born in Germany.
They have excluded them from this society because they were able to photograph with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the Domstadt.
In fact, as her president, I could not conceal that our two young men who have risen up to the German national team were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, in contrast to Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by DFB" by photographs of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to stand before players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm German when I lose, I'm Migrant - that's not possible.
"That he has such an impression, I am very sorry," said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more, I always said.
But he does not see a foundation for the return of Özils to the National Team.
As a follow-up, a supplementary member of the Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, will now be called.
"If a person, without the background of migration, clearly affects the society and the football and says: "The topic is important, we need to care for it," this would also be an initiative to ensure a better basis for our associations in the place where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM out and the Özil Affär, he wants to recruit the office as the DFB President in the next year.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it is," said Grindel.
Three accidents are generated in three hours.
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 and 13 o'clock.
First, the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady at the Red Ampel in the area of Lauter Height.
He told the retire that he had driven against her car.
There was no personal exchange, however, because the 75-year-old could not find the lady on the parking lot anymore.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report on a driver who had gone from the street and traveled to a headquarters.
The man wouldn't want the police in the area and then driven from it.
Then the Red Talent went home.
However, the retire in his dwelling place, in which he has lived for decades, has proceeded and, when he turns around, a construction vehicle.
Finally, the police could find and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a weird impression and couldn't think about many things anymore.
The damage is about EUR 1300.
Moorbrand in Meppen: still nearly 1000 use forces.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a federal army in Emland, 980 employees are still working on loss work.
This announced the Federal Army on Sunday.
Since the situation of a speaker continues to develop stablely, the last 70 honorary helpers were withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of operating forces was planned, says it.
In the night to Sunday, an oberirdian fire had been discovered and deleted.
Last week, the disaster had been lifted, which was called out well a week earlier on September 21, because it had been feared that the flames were at risk of forests and settlements nearby by wind and radiation.
Thursday it was then said that a violation of the fire on adjacent communities no longer threatened.
In time, more than 1,500 of the local forces tried to get the large fire under control.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Federal Wars Test Area at Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also intelligence flights with drones of the Federal Army.
For the second and 5th October, the Bundeswehr also announces that "tornados" are reconstructed.

SPD politician: John Kahrs marrys his friend
John Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the capital church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, the politician married his long-year-old friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - almost a year after the marriage has entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-year-old friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday, they gave themselves the vow in Hamburg.
A registered life partnership had not been in question for them, Kahrs had previously said the "picture" newspaper.
If we marry, then right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old cahr is a budgetary speaker of the SPD Bundestagsfraktion and one of the speakers of the Seaheim circle, the Conservative SPD Floor.
In the Bundestagsdebate on the opening of the marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs was excited with an upset on 30 June 2017.
Thus he had suggested Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have been "storted" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski Moment," he said in suggestion of the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, equal sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Before they had been able to enter their life partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as adoption law.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the referendum expected to be excited about a new name for this small Balkan state has begun.
About 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state is to be called northern Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its similar northern province of Greece.
As a pressure tool, Athens has blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and the NATO for nearly three decades.
If the citizens vote with yes, they will also give the start shot for the West integration of their country.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and to discharge members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be removed only with express consent, emphasises Swiss transplant.
(dpa) Switzerland starts an electronic register for organ donors on this Monday.
This will facilitate organ donations and discharge members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in the case of death can be registered there.
Your wishes are then available in the case of Swiss Transplant.
The new procedure does not change the fact that, as in Germany, organs may be taken away only with express consent, Swiss transplants emphasises.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donor certificate, says Franz Immer, director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card is found in the crucial moment of possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You must then decide in the sense of the deceased what is often very burdensome," says always.
A similar registration system is already available in Great Britain.
In Germany there are considerations to store information on possible organ donation on the hospital card, as the speaker of the Federal Center for Health Intelligence says, Marita Völker-Albert.
"A register in which people can enter their wishes - per or contrary to organ donation - there is not," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken for a new system of organ donations.
According to his proposal, each person would first be considered as an institutional donor unless he or his family were opposed.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in headquarters
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in the headquarters.
On the weekend he spent in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
This announced Martina Flamme-Jasper at the Phaeno Science Museum, the place of the race, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel greeting from Germany made the third place.
The recent WM participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest 74-year-old retiror from France, as chief court Ralf Laue said.
The informatics professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes competition every two years.
For example, the previous tasks were: 14.1430 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since audiences were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants took place against guests from the audience with pocket calculators.
Wenzel greeting from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when he counted.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
Overall 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
As a 14-year-old in Bielefeld, it was already two years ago.
With terms such as super brain, genius or miracle son, organizer Laue can only start a little.
He said, "He can train headquarters."
Many participants practiced several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even competitors in stages.
Among the disciplines, for example, is the square root drawing of six-digit numbers.
The candidates will receive surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here the Germans would also have good chances, said the principal judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often beneficial because in early childhood they are taught more intensely and with other effective methods.

Polare Cold Air brings in the West Neusnee on the mountains
Mrs. Holle shakes her beds for the next week in the West for the first time: Polare Cold Air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the Meteorologists of the Meteorology and Geodynamics Center (ZAMG) the snowfall limit decreases to 1,500 to 1,200 meters at the beginning of the week - in tight valleys it can cut down to about 1,000 meters in strong intensity, said it.
From the Bregenzerwald to the High Tauern, it is expected to be above 2,000 meters with 20 to 40 centimeters of noise.
On higher roads (Arlbergpass, timmelsee, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großgllockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions are therefore winterly.
Farmers may start on Monday with annual knick care
Sleeswig-Holstein's farmers may start on Monday with the annual knick care.
The unique "green waves" in Germany have been the landscape of the forestry state for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide trees and straws are the last retracting rooms for many animals and plants.
Knicks connects as corridors widespread habitats that the exchange of organisms can still work on, as the Managing Director of the Nature Protection League of Germany (NABU) said in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living toes
The knicks were put on the basis of a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living tenes" were not only field limitation and cattle, they also delivered firewood and bars to farmers for their professional workshops.
From that time, his name "Knick" also comes: by "Cnicking" the aces were able to develop the dense, cursed limitations.
Today, the North Sea and the Baltic Sea stretches around 45,000 kilometres of the hills and presents the picture of a luxurious, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by some 7000 species as a replacement habitat.
In a mile Knick, up to 1800 different species could live and bread up to 30 bird pairs.
Its ecologically important function, however, can only fulfil the knick if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he turns into a light tree series, which, besides the diversity of species, also impedes the wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
Knick care may only be operated outside the maturity period from October to March, according to the information of the Ministry of Agriculture.
After Tsunami in Sulawesi Indonesia talks about Situation on site
In the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), the local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the Tsunami:
Did you be on the spot during the Tsunamis?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours, since the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid goods can also be floated.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, which are all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" has also been destroyed, but we have provisionally set up something where we have also placed other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many are run to surrounding hills, on which they still endure out of fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some stay in front of their homes, there are still survivors.
Because many food shops and also the tank stations are fully closed, people are partly stalling food and petrol.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government helps out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners are partly walking freely and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island?
At the moment we got phone receivers, but before it didn't work and we only got information via the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people who do not know whether they live and where they stay, because people were not at home, but on their work during earthquakes.
The tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have information about this?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not met by Tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami meets the region and they are rounded to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't a island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire Ring prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst thing.
We normally know how we react to earthquakes and train evacuation.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit many people.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in Turbotempo
The time is extremely narrow and the number of planned hearings is strongly limited.
The Republicans in the US-Senat, with a FBI investigation in Turbotempo, want to ensure the hooking majority for the contested judges of Brett Kavanaugh.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline until Friday to inform the mediators of the suspected incidents that are more than 30 years behind.
The recent turn in the drama about the calling Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle had been triggered on Friday.
After a eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the Judge exposed the opposition democrats, the Senate’s Justice Committee should free the way for the final confirmation of the Erzconservative Judge at the Supreme US Judge.
The majority of the Republicans seemed secured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded a FBI investigation.
After scenarios of tumult, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who on Thursday still referred to the heavy preservations as "beijss", first of all held further attacks against the women and spoke, on the contrary, of "happiness in the calamity".
In this way, the last doubt could be eliminated, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats sharply when they were electoral, because they refused Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".

FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You've felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is large after the first season victory.
Nevertheless, the factor time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
This was not different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and lots of balls in our championship," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
Finally, the king's blue was still able to bring the bare 1:0 against the Rhinehessen over the time and thus the first season victory under roof and trade.
In fact, it could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 of the team of headtrainer Domenico Tedesco had given security, Tedesco: "In Summe, the first half-time was good, both playful and from the pressing", apparently more and more of the head played a role.
In fact, do not make a headball unhire
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bank, I can understand it."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore keep moving back.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We have all fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpf, who had no unreasonable share with his headball killer: "I am actually the worst headball player in the man's creation."
But at the end only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start pressingly in the initial phase and make a firework from it," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can be happy for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligent, quiet and courageously, so we have to go to parties over 90 minutes
The most likely manco of the afternoon: King blue missed it to worry more about the more clear conditions.
Eventually there were opportunities, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who met twice the Late 59/72 or Amine Harit 62.
"Then there wouldn't have been a citter victory," Tedesco said, "You've already felt the fear a little."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only scalker.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Maphalani discussed integration: A discussion at eye height
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani, is in front of them.
He was repeatedly followed by the invitation by Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I have made it my task for many years to get interesting people to Greven," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Meeting" - that association cooperating with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in the direction of the evening.
El-Maphalani goes much lighter into the reading, describes the writing process of the book, speaks about how difficult it was to explain the subject understandably.
With many gestures, hand-fast numbers and some joke, he brings listeners one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasingly occurring despite successful integration?
The Syrian language author uses the answer to the question of a metaphor.
On one table, the German society is sitting at the Catential, the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to be at the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always been sitting at the large table and now want to decide.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, not whether to order politically to the right or to the left, but, "Is I for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first, then the round of discussions begins.
And there is a need for speech.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in pupils.
El-Maphalani stands in front, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it's on the height of the eye.
The sociology professor does not insist on his opinion, stresses that he speaks of the average, not of individual fates.
He is pleased that there is an interest in the topic, because "when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the next signature hour, he was still a open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialities, discussed intensively.

The need seems to be huge: Over 100 interested people have advocated for the purchase of one of the property in Landsham-South.

This is how Schalkes Naldo succeeds in "great sport" on the bank as well.
For the third time not in the start-up: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to the Schalke Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had been sitting on the exchange bank for the third time, not in the Schalker Startelf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great in many people if the nearly two metres large Brazilians had spoken the fruit of the soul so correctly.
But after the 1:0 victory of the FSV Mainz 05, when the Schalker players gathered as usual in the middle circle and thanked the Chieftrainer Domenico Tedesco for all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who all calls naldo, joined and said: "We have to thank, trainer!"
"It was very emotional, that was a big sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his Vice-Captain, who, despite his reservist's reaction, did not have any crawl.
Likelylich knows Naldo, who was celebrated as the best scalker during the last season, that he was actually not at his trainer - but for good reasons to get a break.
A reason called taxation taxation.
It wasn't easy to tell him that.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that I'm telling you very honestly," Tedesco reported about the moment he had told Naldo that he was not in the startlf.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the matter, it's about the association," founded Tedesco the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It's important that all of us can now go through.
And that we all keep in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which last also caught Naldo.
And to whom the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing himself to the bank as an exemplary team player.
In August, the vote in Austria's industry has continued its valley journey faster compared to the euro area.
The purchase manager index (PMI) was on a 37-month depth with 46.7 points.
However, throughout Europe Austria has the third best vote behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute communicated on Monday to its survey among 3,000 companies.
Unlike Austria, the PMI of the euro zone increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the trade mark of 50 counters, which is increasing.
Only Ireland's industry knocked this threshold with 50.9 points in August.
The Greeks (42.1 points) were final light.
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index with 44.0 points reached the highest level since March.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst was over," said Markit Economist Rob Dobson.
However, in the third quarter the industry remains the growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in view: the export orders in the euro area have not fallen as strong as since November 2011.
Consequently, the companies constructed the seventh month as a successor.
In China, industrial production also decreased more than initially adopted in August.
The mood barometer decreased from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
The expert had initially expected 47.8 points.
The shopping manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industry companies.
Among other things, the developments in turnover, employment, warehouses and prices will be raised.
